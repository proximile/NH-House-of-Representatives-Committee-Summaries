00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
all right I'll try it again I'm going to
 
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 align:start position:0%
open the uh subcommittee work session on
 
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
house Brill 1410 thank you and um I want
 
00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit about you know how
 
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go through this uh there's I
 
00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:16.759 align:start position:0%
think nine sections in this and they're
 
00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
uh very quite different things um and
 
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not necessarily going to go through
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
it in order what I'd like to do is take
 
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
care of some that I think are going to
 
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
be pretty
 
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
straightforward and then we can talk
 
00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 align:start position:0%
about um what we want to do with the
 
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
rest and so the subcommittee will
 
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
probably end up um recommending an
 
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
amendment uh to the full committee and
 
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
it could do different things to
 
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
different parts of the bill
 
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
so um is everybody fine with that I yeah
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
I just had a quick question sure um I
 
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
see sections that are struck out so was
 
00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
this a bill that came last term and and
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
kind of came again no the sections that
 
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
are strike struck out they're striking
 
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
out current statute okay because this is
 
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
changing current statute it's not
 
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
relative to some prior Bill okay and uh
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
the other question I had was the
 
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
numbering you said nine sections so
 
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
there's lot of delete
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
reignment um so I just want to kind of
 
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
if you can just go through what are
 
00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah the the Arabic numerals uh
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
that are the most to the left but I I'll
 
00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
I'll go through it and I'll tell you the
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
page and line numbers that would be
 
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
great as because I have enough trouble
 
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.469 align:start position:0%
great as because I have enough trouble
following

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.350 align:start position:0%
following
this

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.870 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 align:start position:0%
so what I'd like to deal with
 
00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
um first is um there's a number of
 
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
things which I think are
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
just doing things like we're done last
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
session with moving uh certain functions
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
from the boards uh to
 
00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 align:start position:0%
oplc um that weren't done for everything
 
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
some things got missed and so I'd like
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
to deal with those first and I think um
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
the first one in here is on page two
 
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
starting at line
 
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
23 uh nurse practice at act powers and
 
00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
duties of the
 
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
board and um I'd like uh somebody from
 
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
oplc I mean we let other people come up
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
if if they want but if you could come up
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
um Doug and
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know I'll I'll try and explain
 
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
what I think is going on and tell me how
 
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.390 align:start position:0%
what I think is going on and tell me how
I'm

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
wrong which is which is like and you can
 
00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
both you know introduce
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
yourselves good afternoon Douglas so how
 
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
general counsel for oplc with me is
 
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
Bethany catrell she's the division
 
00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
director for licensing and boarding
 
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
Administration okay thank you for being
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
here but again again we'll look at uh at
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
section three powers and duties of the
 
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
board and um what I'm seeing is it's
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
doing things like on line 28 moving you
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
know the the actual exam the licensing
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
and renewal from the board to oplc as we
 
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
did with many other things um similarly
 
00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 align:start position:0%
uh moving some of the disciplinary uh
 
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
action out and um getting rid of some of
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
the stuff on having to maintain the
 
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:30.919 align:start position:0%
records and all that stuff and and also
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
dealing with fees um and so this runs
 
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
through this was section so this runs
 
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
through line you know line 20 on uh on
 
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
page three is the part we're talking
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
about and you know am I correct is it
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
doing something more than just the same
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
stuff we did last time no it's the same
 
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
thing it just brings it in um and
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
comports with 310 at this point
 
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
establishing those roles and
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but there's nothing
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
here when I read through it that
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be or that surprised me in any
 
00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
way okay does anybody on the
 
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee have any questions for them
 
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.510 align:start position:0%
subcommittee have any questions for them
about

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
that so this is currently
 
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
existing uh so oplc has
 
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
the correct operates or functions are is
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for these functions okay
 
00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm trying to get the a little
 
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
history um last year there's this we had
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
this huge redo and there's I think 57
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
boards and in general there were you
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
know each board did a lot of
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
administrative functions themselves the
 
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
idea was to move a lot of those into
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
oplc make it more efficient and and
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
organized and all that and it wasn't
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
done for everything and this is this
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
section is just trying to doing part of
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
that for um nursing for the nurse
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
nursing yeah thank you any other
 
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.509 align:start position:0%
nursing yeah thank you any other
questions

00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
here is there anybody who else who' like
 
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
to speak on this section
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
up if you can turn the mic on please
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you good afternoon my name is
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
Susan buckton I'm the state long-term
 
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
care edsman yeah and I just had a couple
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
of questions related to what you just
 
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
said when I look at this section it
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
appears to me and maybe this is more a
 
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
clarification you're saying that it
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
moves processes from the boards to oplc
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
the authority right correct that's my
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
understanding yes so when I look at
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
starting with line
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
23 it's
 
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
amending 326 B4 the powers and duties of
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
the board to establish eligibility
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
criteria for lure and renewal of lure
 
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
including examination requirements and
 
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
continuing ed
 
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.990 align:start position:0%
continuing ed
requirements

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's what's currently in the
 
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
nurse pra this
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
act establishes those criteria in the
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
nurse practice act so Doug if you could
 
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
come up please um yeah I was wondering
 
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
about that one
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
I doesn't the language for other boards
 
00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:31.079 align:start position:0%
say something about like in consultation
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
with the board or something like that
 
00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:34.519 align:start position:0%
well here the board would actually have
 
00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:35.959 align:start position:0%
the authority to establish these
 
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
criteria so basically if you wanted that
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
sound bite it would be oplc controls the
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
process but the board controls the
 
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
criteria so the board would establish
 
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
the education requirements those types
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
of things but the application would come
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
into oplc we'd run the checklist did
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
they meet the requirements established
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
by the board so I think as I understand
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
it there's a section that struck out on
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
line 28 so the the actual issuing of the
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
licenses and handling renewal is done by
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
oplc corre but this leaves the board
 
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
criteria right is that and I and I I
 
00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
agree with that but when I look at the
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
page bear with me a minute so page six
 
00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh this is no that's past the section
 
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about but we can look at
 
00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
it if you want well because it relates
 
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
to it yeah sure so it
 
00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
removes what line so
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
2099 2930 and
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
31 particularly 29 and 31 talk about the
 
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
cus it talks about those
 
00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:52.839 align:start position:0%
criteria and and it removes the LNA
 
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
portion of CE criteria actually what
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
there is if you look at section one
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
which we're not dealing with at the
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
moment I want to take separately because
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
I know it's controversial um that
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
removes LNA uh licensing and just leaves
 
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
it with the
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
certification and so as part of that um
 
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
you know those would have to be remove
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
but I've got some notes here that some
 
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
of those repeals are tied to the LNA
 
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
thing so let's say we chose not you know
 
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
to delete the LNA dropping the LNA
 
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
license and some of these repeals would
 
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
also go with it and so I'd like to take
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
those together at least unless I'm
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
missing something which I may
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
be I have a question on that one I
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
represent Mani thank you uh Mr chair uh
 
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680 align:start position:0%
the N it also refers to the National
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
Council of State Boards of Nursing for
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.430 align:start position:0%
 
identified

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
so if this is
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:12:59.750 align:start position:0%
so if this is
deleted

00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
deleted
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
how will that affect will there is no
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
RSA tied to that uh I think that that's
 
00:13:07.079 --> 00:13:07.870 align:start position:0%
RSA tied to that uh I think that that's
not

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
being touched um so Doug that language
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
um on on lines 25 and 26 on page two I I
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
didn't go line by line with the RSA in
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
this but isn't that language that's
 
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
already that's currently in the RSA so
 
00:13:25.949 --> 00:13:25.959 align:start position:0%
what they did is they what OSS did when
 
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
they drafted this is they took RSA 2
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
326b 4 and they copied it the whole
 
00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:34.839 align:start position:0%
thing and then they made the changes in
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
it but the the parts here that are not
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
in bold which are added and not struck
 
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
through our current statute so that's
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
not changing
 
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.710 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
subcomittee

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
subcomittee
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you Mr chair and for those
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
table and for you
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
what you said I don't think is what I'm
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
reading the
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
replacement language that's in two
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
establish eligibility criteria for lure
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
and renewal Etc that removes that from
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
the nursing board no no no I think what
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
it does is it it explicitly grants it to
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
no it does say powers of the board the
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
board May okay and and because before
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
under the what you what it used to be
 
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:31.720 align:start position:0%
on three yeah no go ahead yeah I'm sorry
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
I mean we can we can run it really
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
formally we can be a little if there's
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.839 --> 00:14:45.629 align:start position:0%
 
line1

00:14:45.629 --> 00:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
line1
 
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.629 align:start position:0%
 
exam

00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
exam
 
00:14:55.639 --> 00:14:57.389 align:start position:0%
exam
actess

00:14:57.389 --> 00:14:57.399 align:start position:0%
actess
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
yeah right and the parts that struck out
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
on line 28 was before the boards were
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
responsible to actually you know examine
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
license and renew the license of the
 
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
individuals and and that you know the
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
Machinery of running through the process
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
is in oplc but the board will still have
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
the authority to establish the criteria
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you certainly um can oplc
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
tell me will this red one of the biggest
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
uh questions I get about is the time it
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
takes now you know the process so
 
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
by taking that process away from the
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
nursing board will that cut down May
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
basis everybody's Calling My Name
 
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
by I'm going to ignore ignoring them uh
 
00:16:00.279 --> 00:16:01.189 align:start position:0%
by I'm going to ignore ignoring them uh
for

00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
now so the the authority to process the
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
license is actually transferred to the
 
00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:08.839 align:start position:0%
office on July one of last year so we've
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
been doing that process and I well
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
bethan you might be able to answer it
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
better but for one what I understand it
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
is sped up the process and we heard
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
testimony on some other bills yesterday
 
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
that said it has sped up the process so
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
so far as far as I know it's been a
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
success positive change okay great' and
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
if I could just uh you know
 
00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand that that
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
basically um you've been operating as
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
though this change had already occurred
 
00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:38.839 align:start position:0%
because we gave you the authority last
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
year I mean is the board issuing they're
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
not issuing the licenses no we're doing
 
00:16:44.749 --> 00:16:44.759 align:start position:0%
that oplc is doing this so in effect
 
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
this is already been this is the way
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
things are being done and we're just
 
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
straightening out statute so when we
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
originally introduced 655 I think the
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
bill was about 120 some pages long and
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
and representative groa did you know an
 
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
enormous amount of were so this this
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
would be some of the conflicting
 
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
language that we're still addressing
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and and if someone could
 
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
comment answer uh represent mti's
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
question about if somebody could if
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
you're done you if you want no no no she
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
I want her to up on micop I think my my
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
question probably comes later to your
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
point thank you okay okay and as yes if
 
00:17:21.189 --> 00:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
someone can just answer the question
 
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
timeliness thank you Bethany Katrell
 
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.110 align:start position:0%
timeliness thank you Bethany Katrell
again

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
um so the way that the process is now
 
00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.360 align:start position:0%
working is that because the boards are
 
00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
able to set that eligibility criteria
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
and then oplc is doing the operations of
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
that instead of a if an applicant sent
 
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
in their application previously previous
 
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:49.720 align:start position:0%
to this change it would be reviewed and
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
then sent to the board for review and
 
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
then approved or denied at that board
 
00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
meeting now based on these eligibility
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
um requirements and objective criteria
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
with the collaboration of the board were
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
able to approve or deny those licenses
 
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
prior to a board meeting happening so it
 
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
could be three days it could be a week
 
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
it could be 14 days but it does not have
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
to wait for that board meeting unless
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
there is um a requirement for a subject
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
matter expertise at that time it would
 
00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:21.559 align:start position:0%
go still go to the
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
board can I just ask follow yeah so it's
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
simult parallel processing so while the
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
opl see is uh looking at the process of
 
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
granting or renewal board is looking at
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
the requirement and uh they set those
 
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
requirements prior to um yeah but they
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
will be reviewing what the applicant
 
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
status is with regard not the
 
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.950 align:start position:0%
status is with regard not the
application

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
itself but requirement if there's an
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
issue with the application that would go
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
before the board still correct thank you
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
but am I understand they they set the
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
requirements and then that's
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
automatically works for for applicants
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
unless there's some exception or issue
 
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
so what one more last certainly yeah
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
what is the time frame that we are
 
00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:11.559 align:start position:0%
talking 14 days four
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
weeks it's really hard to set a number
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
um because it's based on when we receive
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
a completed application so uh it depends
 
00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:22.039 align:start position:0%
on if someone sends in all of those
 
00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:23.799 align:start position:0%
requirements or if they just send in
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
pieces so it's been very hard to
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
quantify that um if there application is
 
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
complete and they meet all of those
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
requirements it can be done within three
 
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
business days um but it depends again on
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
what that time frame is but that is the
 
00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
goal of the executive director in our
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
strategic plan within the next two is
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
years is to make sure that we're around
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
that time frame based on completed
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
applications and I also want to point
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
out that while we're typically well
 
00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:53.799 align:start position:0%
ahead of the time frames there are time
 
00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:58.120 align:start position:0%
frames in RSA 541 a29 and 29a that sort
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
of of set parameters for us as
 
00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.950 align:start position:0%
of of set parameters for us as
well

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:05.919 align:start position:0%
and represent Brown yeah yes uh thank
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:11.559 align:start position:0%
chair so the criteria that exist in
 
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
number one and the elig elig yeah
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria that's in the new
 
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.070 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria that's in the new
number

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
two are those
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
different so is the nursing board now
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask another question before
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
follow up before I get an answer
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
is the nursing board setting the
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
criteria for what you need to become
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
licensed yes and is that not the
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria that's on line
 
00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:45.559 align:start position:0%
29 um so if you're looking at line 25
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
and 26 that's referencing the National
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
Council of State Boards of Nursing that
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
is the national membership organization
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
that sets be best practice throughout
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
the country and so that um section there
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
is basically saying that the board will
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
stay in um collaboration with those
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
National best practice standards and
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
then if you look at two about
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
establishing the eligibility criteria
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
that is stating that the board will then
 
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
set the administrative rules for those
 
00:21:17.149 --> 00:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
um requirements for applications um and
 
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
lure for nursing got it thank you just
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
to clarify the rulle making Authority
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
starts on page three line 22 and uh line
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
24 specifically references ibility
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
requirements for initial temporary
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
renewal of
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
licenses Okay I uh uh yes representative
 
00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:38.549 align:start position:0%
licenses Okay I uh uh yes representative
uh

00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
G thank you Mr chair I just want to make
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
sure um that I'm following from our
 
00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
previous work together if I and and
 
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
please correct me if I State this wrong
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
so that's my question do I understand
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
this correctly as I understand it there
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
was previously boards doing all this
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
work the office of
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
Licensing became established and slowly
 
00:22:06.789 --> 00:22:06.799 align:start position:0%
has has responsibilities have moved and
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of discussion a lot of
 
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
turmoil across a lot of different boards
 
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
about what parts of the work the board
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
did should be transferred and and so
 
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing here the language is
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
really clear the board will and the
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
section we're talking about now is
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
laying out what the board will still do
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
and the board still is exercising all of
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
their technical knowledge to establish
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
criteria and I don't mean this in any
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
demeaning way but basically the office
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
of Professional Licensing is doing the
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
clerical kind of tasks and they can do
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
it because they work 9 to5 Monday
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
through Friday in a more timely fashion
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
than the board that has to figure out
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
when everybody can get together and meet
 
00:22:53.149 --> 00:22:53.159 align:start position:0%
and you have applicants that are peac
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
mealing things in which further
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
complicate the timeline but an office
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
from 8 to five can handle those pieces
 
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
better is that sort of what we're
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
talking about yes exactly thank you just
 
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
also on the timeline thing um what we've
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
heard testimony before from U executive
 
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
director that they're working on an IT
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
solution where people will be able to
 
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
submit their applications online and the
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
and that system will tell them whether
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
or not they've included so they're not
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
going to submit a partial one it'll tell
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
them you need this this and this and it
 
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
won't actually go into oplc or the
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
boards or anybody until all the pieces
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
are there and instead of you send it in
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe I don't know following it days
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
or weeks to get back oh you're missing
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
this piece you do some round trips and
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully that'll be gone I mean it
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
could add a frustration to you can't
 
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
download you don't know what you're
 
00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
missing but that's that's a a technical
 
00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:49.400 align:start position:0%
challenge but with regard to LNA we are
 
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
focusing on LNA tied into no that's a
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
separate this is a general nurse
 
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
Practice Act this is all the nurses the
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
LNA one is section one one and I know
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
there's going to be there's issues with
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
that okay sorry yeah that's okay okay
 
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
one last question with the nurse Board
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
of Nursing how often do they
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
meet they currently meet monthly unless
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
there's a need for emergency or special
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
meetings okay that's Doug I one further
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
question and that is related to section
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
three are um are any of the repeals in
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
section 10 really
 
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
specifically tied and necessary as part
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
of section
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
three um you know there's a number on
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
326b but I think most of those probably
 
00:24:41.549 --> 00:24:41.559 align:start position:0%
are related to the LNA licensing but I
 
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
it was I don't think there's any related
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
to section but I if you could
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
check I can see is the RSA 326b for
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
these are 19 20 20 16 19 and 21 there's
 
00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
totally 326 DB colon 16
 
00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
326b colum 19 I didn't see any in the
 
00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
section we are addressing two and three
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
right relating to that I was hoping
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a reference that it was
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that we don't have to we
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
we can treat them separately that most
 
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
of those are for the LNA and I know
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
there's some in that whole section for
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
the radiation stuff and that
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
registration and all that but
 
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
as long as if we want to keep Section 3
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
unchanged you know is there anything we
 
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
also have to say in section 10 we need
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.679 --> 00:26:02.549 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
and I'll probably have similar questions
 
00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I'm just looking over it real
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
quick uh I don't think so is yeah I
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
looked I didn't either but I thought you
 
00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
know you're the expert
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
so thought I'd ask okay uh does anyone
 
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:18.039 align:start position:0%
else want to speak on this section
 
00:26:18.039 --> 00:26:19.029 align:start position:0%
else want to speak on this section
section

00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:26:19.039 --> 00:26:22.549 align:start position:0%
section
three

00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you um my name is Samantha
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
O'Neal and I'm the chair of the Board of
 
00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:28.149 align:start position:0%
O'Neal and I'm the chair of the Board of
Nursing

00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
Nursing
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
welcome um thank you um there's one
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
component that I just want to make sure
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
um as it relates to the process of
 
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
application so the Board of Nursing has
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
worked collaboratively with oplc where
 
00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
the board has set the criteria and we've
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
worked with oplc to say here are
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
parameters in which to work from so we
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
can make the process smoother and more
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
efficient so you don't have to wait for
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
a board meeting but if there are
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
applications such as like background
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
checks that have issues um inappropriate
 
00:27:00.389 --> 00:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
um conduct or so forth if somebody has
 
00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
been um uh disciplined in another state
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
those come before us to look at because
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
those are outside of the parameters that
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
the board has set for oplc so we work
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
collaboratively together to make sure
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
that that process is faster and
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
efficient to get people their license
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
quicker thank you any questions
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
uman py and then
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%

00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
else that wants to speak on section
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
three okay see none what I'd like to do
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
and and we continue doing this as we go
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
through is take kind of
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
a an informal vote of the committee and
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
and the the question is uh keep section
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
three in the bill um as is and and uh if
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
you want some discussion that's fine and
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
if not I'll I'll accept a motion yeah my
 
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead if you I leave to you
 
00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
repres just uh just the thing is like as
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
long as we are cutting down down the
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
process time making the process more
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
clean streamlined and it's a
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort so there's
 
00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:09.559 align:start position:0%
collaboration it's not on one shoulder
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
this one board's responsibility no I
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
mean yeah I think they're working
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
together well and it's part of this
 
00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:17.559 align:start position:0%
whole we're trying to do this for all
 
00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
the boards and and there are pieces that
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
were left out and so it's kind of like
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
we gave the authority to oplc and we
 
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
still left certain ones with the board
 
00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
and it it there's a conflict really
 
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
makes sense thank you representative
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
G I move that we accept um the changes
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
in this bill from line 23 on page two
 
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.630 align:start position:0%
in this bill from line 23 on page two
through

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
line um 20 on page three 20 make 23
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
to page yep that's correct I'll second
 
00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.909 align:start position:0%
to page yep that's correct I'll second
that

00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
okay yep doesn't the section two it has
 
00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
to start on page one
 
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
no no I mean the page numberers at the
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
top yeah page one that's I mean there's
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
the title page which count title page
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
two all of section three under the what
 
00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
the nursing board may do and line 21 on
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
page three starts with section four
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
nurse Practice Act and that'll be a new
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
section that is not part of what we just
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
discussed okay so as I understand it uh
 
00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:35.919 align:start position:0%
well I know you tried to make a motion
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
first did you yeah that's that's fine it
 
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter that's I apologize I make
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
an motion I thought it was a
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
question you had the detailed once for
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
this one up uh representative Gould and
 
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
brown seconded it I believe and then uh
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
everybody agrees I anybody anyone oppose
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
okay unanimous five to zero Good Start
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
okay um so we're done with that section
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go on I think the next one
 
00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
we do would be uh section
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
four um which is gets into the um the
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
for um the nurse Practice Act and
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
um Mr AER house if you can come up um Mr
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
Sher so that is Page Three line 21
 
00:31:36.629 --> 00:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
correct y thank you um so looking at
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
this and again this is a correct me if
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong my understanding is that um
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
it's I've seen this Lang this language
 
00:31:46.269 --> 00:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
on uh page three line 25 a lot where
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh moving the
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities you know some of these
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
things might be board the but a bunch of
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
them oplc it just moves the language
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
from from by the board to under this
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
chapter so they're put wherever the
 
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
chapter says they should go and then on
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
the next p and by the way this thing uh
 
00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:09.559 align:start position:0%
section four ends on page four at line
 
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
28 and the rest of this is keeping the
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
language the same except for the
 
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:19.480 align:start position:0%
addition starting on um page four line
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
24 and
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
um and it talk that where it talks about
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
42 CFR the federal um Reg regulations
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
lnas line 24 through 28 on page four it
 
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
does apply to the lnas in the nursing
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
registry but only the
 
00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:48.390 align:start position:0%
lnas okay
 
00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:49.509 align:start position:0%
lnas okay
[Music]

00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
so um what i' I'd like to you know again
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
any questions for anyone here about that
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative G and representative
 
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
Brown then y I mean man py and then
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
Brown um so this Federal Regulation only
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
applies for LNA National Registry is for
 
00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:14.680 align:start position:0%
LNA not for
 
00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.789 align:start position:0%
LNA not for
[Music]

00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
nursing I'm sorry can you repeat your
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
question I I said I'm just curious uh
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
the national C 42 CFR is only for LNA
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
general yes so that is a federal
 
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
registry for licensed nursing assist
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
assistants and um m&amp;as the
 
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.669 align:start position:0%
assistants and um m&amp;as the
medic

00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
medic
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
m&amp;as but it's the registry of nurse AIDS
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
is if you look up that
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
CFR so to clarify it's lnas and m&amp;as you
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
need to be an LNA to become an
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
m&amp; and one more followup certainly thank
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
you we we don't have CNAs in New
 
00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:17.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but this is a national R CNA
 
00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:21.079 align:start position:0%
is also in that certified you mean
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
certified nursing assistant also part of
 
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh I think well yeah somebody else can
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
do and and there's section one of the
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
bill deals with that to some extent but
 
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
which we'll get to go ahead Elizabeth
 
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0%
eaten board counsel to the board of
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
nursing um so the federal registry is
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
for nurse AIDS in New Hampshire we call
 
00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
them licensed nursing assistant or
 
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
medication nursing assistant um an m&amp;
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
has to be an LNA uh it it only applies
 
00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:58.280 align:start position:0%
to nurse
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
AIDS is there a second part to the
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
question so in other parts of the
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
country CNA could be part of that CNA is
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
what some other states call
 
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
lnas we we happen to call them
 
00:35:17.069 --> 00:35:17.079 align:start position:0%
lnas um
 
00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:21.079 align:start position:0%
so what um oh let me ask one other
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
question Doug if we were to eliminate um
 
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
section one not saying we will but if
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
were to eliminate section one uh related
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
to removing the licensing for
 
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
lnas would it uh should this part here
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh page four lines 24 to 28 should it
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
remain or should it be removed I I do I
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
want to make a point that under the
 
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
licensing definition for 541a and in RSA
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
310 the registry is still considered a
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
license so we're talking about removing
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
the license for r r lnas but they'll
 
00:35:56.109 --> 00:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
still but if there's a registration they
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
are still technically licensed by the
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
state and that that's an important
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
important dis I know there are people
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
who are concerned about that at the
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
public hearing but but the just a
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
technical question if we were to get rid
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
of the license for lnas which is in part
 
00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
one should this section on page four
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
remain or not yes we would think that
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
that would remain in in order to meet
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
the federal requirements and to maintain
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
a registry because they're still going
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
to be registered even if we don't have
 
00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
what's an official right and this would
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
allow us to add the renewal ability for
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
the registry and those other pieces that
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
would go along with that okay any other
 
00:36:35.589 --> 00:36:35.599 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Brown first
 
00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
this time thank you Mr chair uh to to
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
either one of you so the on line 24 the
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
implementation of the nursing assistant
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
registry so I think from the first day
 
00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.670 align:start position:0%
registry so I think from the first day
of

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
testimony that that means that New
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will
 
00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:53.720 align:start position:0%
be picking up managing that registry for
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
our nurses that will be on it we can
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
access that registry and that's what I
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
understood from the first day but that
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
could be totally wrong yeah who who who
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
go ahead go ahead if you want to clarify
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
how do the whole process you need me to
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
clarify the coordination between the
 
00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
federal and the state registry so we
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
maintain that registry currently at oplc
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
and so this would just continue that
 
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
registration okay and and followup
 
00:37:27.309 --> 00:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
actually follow different question
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
and there was some concern the first day
 
00:37:34.109 --> 00:37:34.119 align:start position:0%
of testimony about differences
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
in requirements to meet the
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
certification versus an LNA New
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'd like to address I'd like
 
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
to address the actual licensing part
 
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
when we deal with Section one if that's
 
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
okay okay and I'll represent Munch py
 
00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so help me understand
 
00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
this if we remove the LNA
 
00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.630 align:start position:0%
this if we remove the LNA
licensing

00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
provision that will impact m&amp; because
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
you have to be licensed nurse assistant
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
and in order for m&amp; who administer the
 
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
medication that is needed so we
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
cannot technically remove LNA licensing
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.349 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
if you can answer if you have an answer
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
I I I mean so I think what we're trying
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
to do once if if the state requires a
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
registry under 541a that's still a
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
license but the situation we're in right
 
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
now is that an individual can pass those
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
competency programs or evaluations and
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
then they get put on the registry and
 
00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
then there's this potential Gap because
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
there's a separate process for becoming
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
a an LNA licensed in New Hampshire which
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
is that $35 in the application so I
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
think the goal maybe what we should do
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
is is move to section one and then we
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
can come back to section four and that
 
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
might make things easier uh she's still
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
got a question she's looking an answer
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
for but uh what why don't you address
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
the whole you know in context her
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
question then we can so I think the goal
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
here ultimately is to streamline the
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
process once the
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
individual uh passes that competency
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
exam the state is required by the cfrs
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
to put that person on the registry
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
within 30 days so essentially that
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
becomes initial licare there's no
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
separate initial application and there's
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
no other period or and there's no $35
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
fee but it's still if we require an
 
00:39:47.309 --> 00:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
individual to practice to be on the
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
registry that would still be a license
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
and we'd still be able to require CES
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
two-year renewal under RSA 310 those
 
00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
types of things so what this does is it
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
kind of streamlines the the process in
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
the first
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
instance clarification certainly thank
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
you so that clarifies so see if the
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
central registry is just a database
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
where you get the pass and so if I want
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
to practice as an LNA I should go to
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
Next Step get the license then if I want
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
to become an
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
m&amp; further get that
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:27.430 align:start position:0%
m&amp; further get that
today

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
no right that's when I have that's how
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
it is now that's the process as it
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
stands currently so what's removed in
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
this so this process would be saying
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
that if a um if I went and took my
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
course to become an LNA that the state
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
would have um statutes and rules and
 
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
regulations that set up a registry so
 
00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
that way when I pass my course I get
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
onto that registry and based on the
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
current statutes that's considered a
 
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
license here in New Hampshire and then
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
would allow us to set um renewal
 
00:41:08.309 --> 00:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
requirements for the registry you would
 
00:41:10.589 --> 00:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
not have to then do an additional
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
application initial application and pay
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
a fee and then maintain both because
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
right now the way it is is that an LNA
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
has to maintain both a registry and um
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
and the application this would just be
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
streamlining it to be a registration
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
if I if I could ask a quick clar
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
clarification for myself so right now
 
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
let's talk about right now the whole the
 
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.670 align:start position:0%
let's talk about right now the whole the
process

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
of uh of the federal
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
registry and or the federal you know CFR
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
that and our we have a registry set up
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
now and we require if you want to be an
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
LNA the first thing you have to do is
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements of that CFR and
 
00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
get in our registry so is that whole
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
part of it going to stay basically the
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
same so that's not changing it should
 
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
stay the same yes okay if we were to get
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
rid of the license requirement and so
 
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
the LI you know so they do that first
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
and then they apply for the the state
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
license as opposed to
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
registration and um other than paying
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
the fee are there any other
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
requirements believe there's a criminal
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
background check that's required under
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
the current application that wouldn't be
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
required once because the CFR says once
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
the individual passes receives that
 
00:42:30.549 --> 00:42:30.559 align:start position:0%
their exam whatever they are
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
automatically placed on the
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
registry so there is a difference in
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
that piece on the can I get
 
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
clarification on the criminal background
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
check we could be a little I mean okay
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
if you're okay with that yeah are you
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
saying that if we eliminate the second
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
duplicative licensing process and we
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
just go with the registry we don't have
 
00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:55.839 align:start position:0%
a mechanism for a criminal background
 
00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:56.829 align:start position:0%
a mechanism for a criminal background
check

00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
we do not by eliminating this
 
00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:02.990 align:start position:0%
we do not by eliminating this
duplicative

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
process before I answer that question I
 
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
think there was an additional thing I
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
was unaware of if I could let board
 
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
counsel y go
 
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
ahead so in addition to the background
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
check there's also uh in New Hampshire a
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
higher level of educational requirements
 
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
including a higher level of clinical
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
practice um before you graduate and and
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
complete your program
 
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
that to be my question and related to
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
that is there any difference in the
 
00:43:33.549 --> 00:43:33.559 align:start position:0%
scope of practice that you have today if
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
you've got the registration and the
 
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
license or if we were to do this just
 
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:42.230 align:start position:0%
license or if we were to do this just
the

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
registration that seems to be a point of
 
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
contention I would say no because the
 
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
state gets to set the Practice Act but I
 
00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:49.720 align:start position:0%
think there might be people behind me
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
who disagree with that answer no from
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
what I understand sorry Mr chair I
 
00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
jumped yeah we can
 
00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:01.480 align:start position:0%
beay in in order even if you practice
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
like if a high school student is doing
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
the LNA track heon and they get 20 hours
 
00:44:10.589 --> 00:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
and they can do another 20 hours total
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
of 40 hours of training before they
 
00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:17.720 align:start position:0%
apply for license to practice as LNA in
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire correct so is it the same
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
as National Registry or National
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
Registry has a less are um uh hours the
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
National Registry does have fewer hours
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
required for both classro and clinical
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
experience um to to answer your scope
 
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
question it really differs by state
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
because State can regulate the scope of
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
practice certainly And to clarify on
 
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:48.280 align:start position:0%
that too uh the state can also set the
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
standards for training and
 
00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
competency okay
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
um is what's
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.510 align:start position:0%
um is what's
proposed

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
M microphone go right from the registry
 
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
to m&amp; you don't need the license right
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
when you were on the registry you would
 
00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
be in LNA but how do you become the
 
00:45:09.309 --> 00:45:09.319 align:start position:0%
m&amp;a there's a separate application for
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
an m&amp;a right but do you need the license
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
which is proposed to go away no no
 
00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.069 align:start position:0%
which is proposed to go away no no
problem

00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
solved representative Brown okay going
 
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
back to the question I started asking
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
before and it's been made more confusing
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
to me
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
so it it sounds like what the the person
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
from The Board of Nursing said there's
 
00:45:34.589 --> 00:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
more hours and more clinical as it as it
 
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
now stands than the federal piece if we
 
00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
go to this registry do those
 
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
requirements go
 
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
away how where are they managed so it
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
would not be that they go away but
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
that's the section that we were talking
 
00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
about prior to going here um on page
 
00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
four line 26 to 28 that's what I was
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
going to ask back then so that's the
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
that we were saying would still stay in
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
that there would still be a requirement
 
00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
for the Board of Nursing to set
 
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
requirements for a nurse aid training
 
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
and competency evaluation program that
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
would be pursuant to that so that would
 
00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
be the place where you'd be able to set
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
those requirements okay so let let me
 
00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:18.559 align:start position:0%
sort of follow up to that thank you so
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
if we if we passed section one and we
 
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
got rid of the nurse license would
 
00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:28.839 align:start position:0%
what's here online 4 24 to 28 let uh the
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire board and
 
00:46:33.549 --> 00:46:33.559 align:start position:0%
oplc basically put in the same
 
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
requirements on training and and maybe
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
scope of practice as we have
 
00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
today that's the way I read it yes does
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
anyone disagree with
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
that the only the only thing missing
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
here that I can tell is the background
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
check and so they can do the competency
 
00:46:54.549 --> 00:46:54.559 align:start position:0%
they can do the evaluation all of that
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
but um there's no implementation of a
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
background check here
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
okay just to finish this I mean if we if
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
we wanted to if is that true there's no
 
00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
background check and would there be any
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
problem putting somewhere in here saying
 
00:47:11.069 --> 00:47:11.079 align:start position:0%
they had to have a background check
 
00:47:11.079 --> 00:47:12.870 align:start position:0%
they had to have a background check
thank

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
you we might have to add two right
 
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
background check and renewal so once
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
they get on the reg Ren here it's I am I
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
sorry we a little free form but not too
 
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
much so first of all let's do the
 
00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
background check one it so right now
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be a requirement the
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
problem is if you have to automatically
 
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
put an individual on the registry when
 
00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
is the time for the background tracks
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
but let me follow up on that if you're
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
saying we can add additional training
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
requirements it would sound like we
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
couldn't do that if you have to put them
 
00:47:47.109 --> 00:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
on the background check when they meet
 
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
the federal requirements or is that
 
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
incorrect thank
 
00:47:56.109 --> 00:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
you my understanding for how they go
 
00:47:59.390 --> 00:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
onto the registry is that they would
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
have to pass a course that is approved
 
00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
by the Board of Nursing or pass the
 
00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
competencies that are approved by the
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing and then they would be
 
00:48:09.549 --> 00:48:09.559 align:start position:0%
put onto the registry and so then that
 
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:13.480 align:start position:0%
would be their license but because there
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
isn't something a time or an application
 
00:48:20.109 --> 00:48:20.119 align:start position:0%
in between then the background check
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
would not be able to be an additional
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
requirement it would have to be set
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
prior to in those educational and
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
competency requirements but can we do
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%
that if we don't have the license and
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
we're just doing the registration my
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
understand my understanding is yes based
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
on how we approve what educational
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
programs and competencies will allow
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
them to be put on the registry so it
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be that yeah go on correct it
 
00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be that someone in Wyoming
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
would finish their LNA and be put on the
 
00:48:53.069 --> 00:48:53.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire registry so this is this
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
is the New Hampshire registry that's
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
based in Federal requirements okay so
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
uhu I one thing I want to bring up and
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
that is I had a discussion with
 
00:49:02.589 --> 00:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
representative grota before you know at
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
the end or I think it was yesterday and
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
I guess she has a bill which is to deal
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
with nursing I think there's some uh
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
Comm committ some study and maybe an
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
actually Bill to do things and she was
 
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:17.710 align:start position:0%
actually Bill to do things and she was
um

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
suggesting that we take the section one
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
out and that she she could deal with it
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
in that and the reason I mean I told her
 
00:49:29.069 --> 00:49:29.079 align:start position:0%
we'd start looking at it and see what we
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
thought because it sounds like probably
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
we're okay but it's sounds a little
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
unclear because what the question the
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
real overarching question is can we get
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
rid of the license and still have the
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
lnas that are certified only have um at
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
least similar training and scope of
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
practice as today and also somehow have
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
a background check as today so that's
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
the question are we can we really be
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
sure the answer to that is yes I think
 
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
the background check comes at like the
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
employer employee level so I me I'd be
 
00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
okay with that but see if other people
 
00:50:10.789 --> 00:50:10.799 align:start position:0%
are comfortable without the requirement
 
00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
but my couple of uh questions I have
 
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
is background check is to make sure the
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
TR you know transitional nature of the
 
00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
communities now you know I could be here
 
00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:29.799 align:start position:0%
today I could move across the country
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
and that's an easy one so the background
 
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
check and if there is no requirement to
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
renew my license or you know who's
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
keeping track of my continuing ad once I
 
00:50:47.069 --> 00:50:47.079 align:start position:0%
get the registry and I'm
 
00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
fine where is the checks and balance as
 
00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:51.880 align:start position:0%
we are asking them to take care of I
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be clear that under
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
541a if you're placed on the registry
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
that would be a license as long as we
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
required that registry so then we could
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
make a renewal process with the CE
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
requirements and all that and maintain
 
00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
those as we go every two years it would
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
renewed that that would make it
 
00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:13.880 align:start position:0%
more solid in terms of what we are
 
00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:18.200 align:start position:0%
providing for care for our constituents
 
00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
who need this care that we are
 
00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
overseeing the quality of care through
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
whether you call it licensing or renewal
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
registry but there should be a oversight
 
00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
by nursing board or oplc that would
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
still exist yes that will still
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
ex again just to reiterate it if if we
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
were to leave section one in and the
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
repeals that are in section 10 related
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
um you know you could it'd be done
 
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
through rulemaking but you could have
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
basic with the same training
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
requirements um you could require
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
require a background check and I don't I
 
00:52:03.549 --> 00:52:03.559 align:start position:0%
mean you mean if if it's required for
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
the registration do the employers then
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
do another one or would there be some
 
00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:09.640 align:start position:0%
value to having one and if you move in
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you're you're covered I I
 
00:52:11.599 --> 00:52:12.789 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you're you're covered I I
don't

00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
know the process the process currently
 
00:52:17.309 --> 00:52:17.319 align:start position:0%
is if someone has to have a background
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
check through oplc uh to get their
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
license then that stays with us if they
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
then need to have another one through
 
00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:24.839 align:start position:0%
their employer they would have to do
 
00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
that again and so be the same if there
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
was a registration and and we added a
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
requirement so you wouldn't be able to
 
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
add a require to the registration you
 
00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
would not be able to add a requirement
 
00:52:36.349 --> 00:52:36.359 align:start position:0%
of the background check because there
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
would not be a time frame or an
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
application for them to be able to do
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
that so I think that's what board
 
00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
counsel was also saying and I I believe
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
there are people that might want to
 
00:52:47.589 --> 00:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
testify separate to that sure um so what
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
we are saying is that it in this field
 
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
tends to fall on the employer to do
 
00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:54.760 align:start position:0%
those background checks so if we were to
 
00:52:56.990 --> 00:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
remove the license type and just have it
 
00:52:59.549 --> 00:52:59.559 align:start position:0%
be a registry which under 541a is still
 
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
considered a license it would remove the
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
initial requirement at lure for
 
00:53:06.789 --> 00:53:06.799 align:start position:0%
background checks and place that
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
requirement on the employer would the
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
would it actually place the requirement
 
00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
on the employer or the expectation the
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
expectation uh I can tell you as an
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
employer of a home care we used to spend
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
hundreds of dollars on background check
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
physical and they would you know we had
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
to pay for the training then they got 5
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
cents more someplace else we couldn't go
 
00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
back and I would say ask us we'll give
 
00:53:37.069 --> 00:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
you the background check don't spend
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
another money but they don't because
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the owners on the employer
 
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:43.799 align:start position:0%
it's the burden on the so maybe you can
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
answer this and other people so today
 
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
because the lnas are required to have
 
00:53:51.549 --> 00:53:51.559 align:start position:0%
the background check as part of the
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
state license do the employers not spend
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
the money to do a background Che of
 
00:53:59.950 --> 00:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
their own to get their license it's the
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh lna's responsibility but if they want
 
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
to get employed then the employer has to
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
do it again that's on the so it is
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
already being done by the by both really
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
exactly so it's duplicative basically
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
okay I think I think it depends on the
 
00:54:20.349 --> 00:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
employer oh okay yeah uh representative
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
uh Brown okay uh two questions for the
 
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:25.960 align:start position:0%
nursing board folks
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
on on page four the the two new sections
 
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
15 and 16 it was just said that that
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
covers the difference between a registry
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
now and the Board of Nursing
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
requirements now that those two sections
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
allow us to have more some more strict
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
requirements than the registry I haven't
 
00:54:52.109 --> 00:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
read through the CFR but I don't read
 
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
the English in those two lines as saying
 
00:54:54.400 --> 00:55:01.349 align:start position:0%
the English in those two lines as saying
that

00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:02.829 --> 00:55:02.839 align:start position:0%
it's everything except the background
 
00:55:05.549 --> 00:55:05.559 align:start position:0%
check so the background check is our
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
biggest concern okay so so all right so
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
everyone in the room is clear that 15
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
and 16 means the Board of Nursing can
 
00:55:17.069 --> 00:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
have some extra requirements on top of
 
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
the registry that's what I want to make
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
sure and there's a hush in the room so
 
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:22.950 align:start position:0%
sure and there's a hush in the room so
we're

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
good second question and I apologize for
 
00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.150 align:start position:0%
good second question and I apologize for
being

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
blunt if we don't have a background
 
00:55:34.829 --> 00:55:34.839 align:start position:0%
check are we saying that elas and if
 
00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:39.079 align:start position:0%
there's a person that has uh elder abuse
 
00:55:41.549 --> 00:55:41.559 align:start position:0%
that we're okay giving them a license
 
00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
that's the problem sir so yesterday we
 
00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:46.359 align:start position:0%
had a board of nursing meeting we had
 
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
four hearings all four hearings were
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
based on background checks for lnas we
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
approved two we denied two 81% % and I
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
this was in my testimony last week
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
81% of LNA applications come before the
 
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
board for criminal background concerns
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
and so we have specic specific criteria
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
that we hold near and dear to make sure
 
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
that the community is safe employers now
 
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:15.640 align:start position:0%
my background I'm the public member and
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
the chair so my background is human
 
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
resources I've been doing human
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
resources for way longer than I would
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
like to admit um and nine years of it
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
has been in healthcare so I have uh
 
00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.670 align:start position:0%
has been in healthcare so I have uh
industry

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
experience the the there are um
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
expectations that employers do
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
background checks but however there's no
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
um consistent set criteria for each
 
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
institution so what one institution
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
might feel um is not eligible for
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
employment another one might say that
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
there is and so it really is either
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
internal employer policy or just they
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
need B so they're more lenient but the
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing has strict criteria
 
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
what is acceptable and what isn't
 
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
acceptable and those that have um
 
00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:07.039 align:start position:0%
questional backgrounds um they're
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
required to submit an explanation in
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
front of the board and then if the board
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
wants additional information we ask them
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
to come before us in a show cause
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
hearing so we can have a dialogue with
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
them to understand what occurred and and
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
make determinations on um whether or not
 
00:57:28.589 --> 00:57:28.599 align:start position:0%
um we would issue a license or not based
 
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
on uh those criteria okay and thank you
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
and that follow up Mr chair yeah that
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
would become an after Thea process then
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
if this happens there if there's no
 
00:57:39.309 --> 00:57:39.319 align:start position:0%
background check up
 
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
front and and maybe I I I'd be
 
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
interested to hear what anyone else has
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
to say whether they think that's
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
necessary can you be a carpenter for
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
example if if you're back whatever
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
whatever we don't Li whatever industry
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
you want to be in can you can you do
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
that industry if you have had
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
XYZ problems with the criminal justice
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
system and so are we saying if you have
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
been found guilty of elder abuse can you
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
be an
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
LNA right now no but um without a
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
background check you possibly could so
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
for for example yesterday one of the
 
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
background checks was sexual um sexual
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
assault of a minor that came before us
 
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
so that we have simple assault we've had
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
kidnapping we've had drug um um drug
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
possession but yesterday if we didn't do
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
a background check that individual who
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
um was arrested for sexual assault of a
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
minor could work and we would not know
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
that right and so there there really
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
needs to be um some precautions and and
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
guard rails surrounding background
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
checks for the employers you know for
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
the the people that are looking for
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
licenses know you put somebody in a
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
long-term care facility that's that's an
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
issue and and I think this was said
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm sorry I think this was
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
said yes the in the testimony the first
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
day that once something has happened
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
it's too late to fix it and so maybe we
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
need to have this background so just
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
just to get a feel on this um yeah sorry
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
the elder abuse is obvious but what sort
 
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
of uh things uh you know the people
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
might have u a background issue that
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
would be considered acceptable for I
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
mean with simple like cannabis
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
possession or something right something
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
like that yes um you know it would if if
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
somebody had criteria on DUI for example
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
right or was it were they there's a
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
difference between having a DUI versus
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
being impaired at work you know was were
 
00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
they um was it drug possession was it
 
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
impairment at work or was it I was young
 
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
and dumb and did something that I
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have and I've learned my
 
00:59:54.029 --> 00:59:54.039 align:start position:0%
lesson because it happened 10 years ago
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
but those are are all things that come
 
00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
before us that we question and look at
 
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
and review which has that the parameters
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
for safety so I I'd like to if people
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
are okay with it cut this short and okay
 
01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
representative G thank you Mr chair my
 
01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
question to you all is with a
 
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
license is a licens nurses aid able to
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
advertise and accept employment
 
01:00:29.069 --> 01:00:29.079 align:start position:0%
privately in homes with patients in New
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is there anything in the law
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
preventing someone once they issued a
 
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
license from hanging out a shingle and
 
01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.470 align:start position:0%
license from hanging out a shingle and
taking

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
taking
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
employment no they could do that but if
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
they're and they do do if they go
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
through so in that
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
scenario um an individual hiring an LNA
 
01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
that would not most likely not do a
 
01:00:53.029 --> 01:00:53.039 align:start position:0%
background check correct but we would
 
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
have that safety guard in the front end
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
when they were obtaining a license to be
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
able to clear them to work as an LNA you
 
01:01:02.589 --> 01:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
have that now but if this goes through
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
the way we're saying it would not be
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
there and that's what this committee is
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
not hearing is that it's not all nice
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
little agencies that we can hope are
 
01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
going to have the kind of criteria that
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
will protect the elderly from theft from
 
01:01:20.190 --> 01:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
their drugs being stolen and sold on the
 
01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
street like oxyen and the other highly
 
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
addictive drugs from their money being
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
taken from the other kinds of abuses
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
that happen from child molesters going
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
into the home because the public thinks
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
oh the state's giving a license this
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
person must be safe they're licensed
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
correct I'd like I see where this is
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
going I thank
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
you okay the nursing board do they still
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
have the criminal background check is
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
one with you know neglect and abuse
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
reported ba the
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
yeah the Bureau of BU of elderly and
 
01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:02.359 align:start position:0%
Affairs uh registry yes do they still
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
have that how is
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
nursing I might actually be able to
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
answer that because I used to be elderly
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
and Adult Services general counsel at
 
01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
HHS and I actually did registry hearings
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
um so if you act if you look at in the
 
01:02:15.559 --> 01:02:16.990 align:start position:0%
um so if you act if you look at in the
CFR

01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
CFR
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
48316 part of the registry content is
 
01:02:23.549 --> 01:02:23.559 align:start position:0%
that um the as part of the registry the
 
01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:25.559 align:start position:0%
state must provide any response to an
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
inquiry that includes a finding of abuse
 
01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
neglect or misappropriation of property
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh also included a statement disputing
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
the finding and then it um Down Below in
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
the CFR adds some more detail uh
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
documentation of the state's
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
investigation nature of the
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
allegation date of the hearing statement
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
by the individual um section D is
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
important the information must be
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
included in the registry within 10
 
01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
working days of the findings and must
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
remain in the registry permanently but
 
01:02:57.630 --> 01:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
what that means is when you're
 
01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:00.039 align:start position:0%
practicing somebody does something you
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
have a hearing over at the aaou at HHS
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
and uh the administrative you know they
 
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
find find against you your name goes on
 
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
that list for for those purposes um I
 
01:03:15.309 --> 01:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
can also say that I don't think there's
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
a requirement for facilities to check
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
that registry Beyond initial
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
hiring and just as a followup um
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
currently we do not run a beas or DCF
 
01:03:29.549 --> 01:03:29.559 align:start position:0%
registry check when someone is applying
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
for a license here in New Hampshire so
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
we only do the FBI fingerprinting which
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
only comes back if there is um law
 
01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.950 align:start position:0%
only comes back if there is um law
enforcement

01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:41.799 align:start position:0%
involvement just to clar so you don't
 
01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
cross check with criminal background
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
check to B we do not have that requ that
 
01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:50.839 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement for that okay so
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
there used to be a thing in old models
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
where doctor go bad and he get struck
 
01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
off the registry is that's what's going
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
to happen here that these people are
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
registered but they've abuse the elderly
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
and they get struck off well that's what
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
Jackie wants to work out yeah I I would
 
01:04:09.269 --> 01:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
like to please uh I would I would like
 
01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
to make a motion that we um eliminate we
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
we get rid of section one and any SE any
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
parts of section 10 that uh Mr oser
 
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
House assures me only is related to the
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
removal of the LNA license which I think
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
is most of the 326b stuff but not all of
 
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
it um and then what I would do is
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
include that as part of the amendment I
 
01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
get OS to put together and would send
 
01:04:43.109 --> 01:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
out to people and what we're voting on
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
here is this is our
 
01:04:47.549 --> 01:04:47.559 align:start position:0%
intent and um and then you know we'll
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
either have an opportunity as the
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or the full committee to
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
vote on the final Amendment if people
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
are okay with any discussion I said
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
second that motion my only concern is
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
that background check not attached to
 
01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
the LNA that's a critical link Missing
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
Link I understand that's I mean it
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
sounded to me like we were okay I mean
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
people could maybe get comfortable with
 
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
all of it because they could add the
 
01:05:15.069 --> 01:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
training requirement because but because
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
of the way the federal thing works we
 
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
can't add the background check and so
 
01:05:21.230 --> 01:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
there's a larger effort going on in the
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
nursing thing and maybe there's a way to
 
01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
fix it there I don't know Jackie can
 
01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
look at Jackie can look at it and um and
 
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
I you know whatever my view is on this
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't think we're we're
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
not going to get through this with the
 
01:05:38.589 --> 01:05:38.599 align:start position:0%
background check uh requirement removed
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
no you're not okay so that would be my
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
hesitation big hesit understand some of
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
what you said earlier I didn't hear
 
01:05:47.269 --> 01:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
because it was going that way about
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative gr's what she's doing
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
representative groda she spoke to me
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
later yesterday I think
 
01:05:57.789 --> 01:05:57.799 align:start position:0%
and um so I don't know the details but
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
there is a bill is it um if if anyone's
 
01:06:04.109 --> 01:06:04.119 align:start position:0%
familiar with it is it just a study or
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
is it actually going to do something I
 
01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
don't know but there is another bill
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
related to nursing and which she said is
 
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
you know if we
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
remove this part out of this bill the
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
LNA part out of this bill that you know
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
she would add it and address it as part
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
of the larger Bill and that's what I'm
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
proposing I mean so she's proposing a
 
01:06:31.269 --> 01:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
whole uh for and nursing as a
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
entirety that's that's my understanding
 
01:06:37.269 --> 01:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
from what she said and so um I don't
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
think we you know there's going to be
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
disagreement on this one for you know
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable reasons um and so my proposal
 
01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
my Mo motion which is who second you did
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate yeah yeah section
 
01:07:07.269 --> 01:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
one that's a huge T no no uh it's uh no
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
no no no it's short it's short no let me
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
let me get to it it's it's um right page
 
01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
no it's no it doesn't go to page three
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
because that's well it's only page it's
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
it which we had uh which we'll get to in
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
a in a bit okay um and anything any
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
parts of section 10 and I don't know if
 
01:07:39.029 --> 01:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
you have those
 
01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
or what I don't have the specific
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
language in front of me okay so I we
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
could take a look at the list can you
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
get back to me
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
when yeah all right all right so I was
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
kind of hoping to put an amendment in
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
well we're not going to when when are we
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
executing we're not executing
 
01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:03.349 align:start position:0%
executing we're not executing
until

01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
February I I don't know that we have to
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
meet again but if we have to we can just
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
meet before but the question is when do
 
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
we need this for Carol and I think we're
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
wait when did she say we were going to
 
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
be executing after session on which
 
01:08:24.789 --> 01:08:24.799 align:start position:0%
day the first
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
okay we have is it next Thursday yeah
 
01:08:28.749 --> 01:08:28.759 align:start position:0%
we're gonna be going on for a while here
 
01:08:30.829 --> 01:08:30.839 align:start position:0%
I mean end sometime on
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
Monday sometime on Monday okay thank you
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
and and so it's the motion is to repeal
 
01:08:40.269 --> 01:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
page one lines one to five just to be
 
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
clear you want me to go through this
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
list see strike the ones that that are
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
related to to the LNA lure okay and and
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
just just give me a list you know of
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
which ones because I have to give it to
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
all us to and and more discussion uh
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
line P I mean sorry so the section
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
10 I have to write this up 10 for um you
 
01:09:10.510 --> 01:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
repeals we there's no guarantees in life
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
but I I think I think you know she said
 
01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
she would I she's been trustworthy um
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
not but I mean she and she may not get
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
it in I mean she can try and do
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
something who knows what will happen and
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
it may not be something we like but what
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
I think the situation right now is
 
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
there's concern about this background
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
check right show you know even if some
 
01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
of us you know voted to pass this as is
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
trusting the employer except There's
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
issues you know it's I don't see it
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
passing the committee and so I don't see
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
any point in you know in holding this
 
01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:46.759 align:start position:0%
bill up the parts we want to get through
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
because of this section that's my my
 
01:09:53.149 --> 01:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
biggest concern or question for that is
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that the highest need is for
 
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
elderly LNA for elderly services and the
 
01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable population and we also
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
want the workforce to stay stable and
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
will this effect if I ask you will this
 
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
jeopardize what we are embarking on by
 
01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.709 align:start position:0%
jeopardize what we are embarking on by
making

01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
making
 
01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
it less safe or I I don't want to use
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
the word less safe but less oversight
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
will it improve Workforce or will it
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the qu are you asking about how
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
the bill is written or at the motion
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
that representative leus has made at the
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
motion to remove Elan out of it his
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
motion I believe was to repeal the
 
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
removal is that correct right that would
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
leave things as they are today unchanged
 
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
so I think his motion was to leave the
 
01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
statute as it is not as it is proposed
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
here right so there would be I mean the
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
the and you can speak to this my
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is one of the reasons for
 
01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
this is you know lnas don't get paid a
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
whole lot we actually want to get people
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
in the field they and U and had
 
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
requiring both the registration which we
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
must and the license which we could get
 
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
rid of um you know sets up more hurdles
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
and more cost and more time and so the
 
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
goal here I think was to help get more
 
01:11:20.669 --> 01:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
lnas and so by removing the section
 
01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
we're not helping with that goal but
 
01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
there are con concerns and I mean that's
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
why I mean that's why I support it in
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
the first place but but one one last
 
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
quick question sorry yeah keep we both
 
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
keep turning it on I'll let you thank
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr chairman I just wanted to say
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
and um that's why I have confidence this
 
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
will get picked up in another one
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
because the bottom line is we want our
 
01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
lowest income employees which
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
are uh in the field our our licensed
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
nursing aids to not be hit with these
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
fees we want to protect them from the
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
punitive damage that our duplica current
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
duplicative process has on them while
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
still recognizing the safety for the our
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable the elderly and we know
 
01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
we that's a large part of our population
 
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
understand and I don't I don't know you
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that but hopefully it
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
can be fine the other thing I would
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
recommend to um res M you it seem to
 
01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
have some concerns that the current
 
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
process which would stay um doesn't have
 
01:12:24.750 --> 01:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
this Che back or there's some elderly
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
abuse thing what I would say is talk to
 
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative groa and maybe as part
 
01:12:32.189 --> 01:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
of her process something could happen
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
and with this changes will the
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
um opportunity for the lna's growth in
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
the career path does that make it uh
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
more easy to move on to licensed nursing
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
or next level kind of thing the
 
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity for career growth
 
01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think that this changes any of
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
those requirements or would I'm not sure
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
how that would affect
 
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
that that would
 
01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
be yes representative Browns all right
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair take and thank you
 
01:13:10.270 --> 01:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
folks at the table again so if we
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
eliminate section
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
one does that make page three line 24
 
01:13:17.199 --> 01:13:18.470 align:start position:0%
one does that make page three line 24
through

01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
point I think already asked that I think
 
01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:26.679 align:start position:0%
the answer was no but he can see what he
 
01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
says that's kind of the question I
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
already asked but do you still we still
 
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
have to maintain the registry okay thank
 
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
you that's simple thank you and then um
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
okay um any other discussion on this or
 
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
um all in
 
01:13:44.669 --> 01:13:44.679 align:start position:0%
favor anybody opposed okay so that's
 
01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's what we'll do um and when I get
 
01:13:50.189 --> 01:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
the details from Mr aerous I will draft
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
that part of the amendment so let's go
 
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
back Mr chair can I ask one quick follow
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
up to the something that came out in
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
that previous discussion um as we're
 
01:14:02.629 --> 01:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
talking about possible amendments so I'm
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
very concerned to hear that um the
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
dcyf uh registry and the other registry
 
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
are not being checked for licensing
 
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
currently and is that something that can
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
be done in rulemaking or do you need
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
something legislatively should we add
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
something in this bill as it if we are
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
doing an amendment
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
that that directs you to look at those
 
01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
two Registries uh I mean why are we
 
01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
keeping safety Registries of known
 
01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
problems against women and children and
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
the elderly and not looking at it when
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
we're issuing license I think that's
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
probably a question better posed to HHS
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
than us um I don't know much about oplc
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh but the comment I made was a few
 
01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
years back maybe three years ago now
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
when I was beas counsel there was a
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
requirement to check the registry upon
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
hiring but not after after that so if an
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
individual is subsequently added an
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
employer might not know I they send
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
notifications HHS would highly recommend
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
employers check frequently some do not
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
all and I would just I just want to add
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
in um other experiences I would say um
 
01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
like uh Mr asera just said that oh has
 
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
to correct me every time I'm sorry um
 
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
that it you would want to look first at
 
01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:23.709 align:start position:0%
that it you would want to look first at
HH

01:15:23.709 --> 01:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
HH
 
01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
because they have specific rules and
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
regulations on who they can release it
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
to so if the change was going to come
 
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
from somewhere I think that would have
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
to be step one and then looking at oplc
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations would be step
 
01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
two and as I said I'd suggest taking
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
that up with Jackie because they're
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
doing a larger study on nursing and that
 
01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
could be something that they could deal
 
01:15:46.350 --> 01:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
with there that's my suggestion not not
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do here we don't know yeah as
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
of now I think the agencies whether it's
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
small agency or big big large hospital
 
01:15:57.390 --> 01:15:57.400 align:start position:0%
it you know you're supposed to uh report
 
01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
to bees and uh it's the
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
individuals where they don't have access
 
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
they trust you to say you have the
 
01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
license you know and that is the one
 
01:16:10.830 --> 01:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
that would be they'll fall through the
 
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
cracks and that would be the concern
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
because if you have to get licensed
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
agency certified to practice that or
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
provide that Services you have to to do
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
these things correct that's on the
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
employers own you're right and there's a
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
growing I mean I know a lot of people
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
hiring private licensed nursing aids for
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
their parents and
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
grandparents so I'd like to go back then
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
to section 4 which starts on page three
 
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
line 21 and ends on page 4 line 28 which
 
01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
we had started on and there's really
 
01:16:51.510 --> 01:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
only two changes in there one is the
 
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
addition at the end of that starting at
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
line 24 on page P well it start the
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
whole section starts on page three line
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
21 and the whole thing ends on page four
 
01:17:04.239 --> 01:17:05.510 align:start position:0%
21 and the whole thing ends on page four
line

01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
28 and so there's two changes in here
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
the rest of its existing statute one is
 
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
starting on page four line 24 till the
 
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
end is what we just discussed which is
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know uh having them handle the
 
01:17:21.790 --> 01:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
registry which is they're required to do
 
01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
um the only other changes understand it
 
01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
is on page three line
 
01:17:29.470 --> 01:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
25 which is another one of these things
 
01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
where under the changes we made last
 
01:17:35.709 --> 01:17:35.719 align:start position:0%
year we moved certain Authority from the
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
board to oplc and this change just says
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
this has to be done said in set of by
 
01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
the board under this chapter and
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
elsewhere under this chapter tells oplc
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
to do it so it's it's kind of a clean up
 
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
right those two changes and so may I ask
 
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
a clarifying question Mr chair so my
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is that line 24 through 28
 
01:17:58.629 --> 01:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
on page four is simply putting into
 
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
statute practice that's already
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
happening thank you right and so I guess
 
01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
why do it need to be there I just it's a
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
good idea clarification okay all right
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you how does the Board of Nursing
 
01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.310 align:start position:0%
thank you how does the Board of Nursing
or

01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
nurse yeah actually good point do you
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
folks or anybody have uh any issue with
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
this SE that should clarify or that's
 
01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
clean no we're we're fine with that the
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
biggest concern was the background
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
checks for us
 
01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:29.950 align:start position:0%
checks for us
yeah

01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
understand certainly I'd like to move
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
that we uh to agreement on section four
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
four we keep it as is and keep it
 
01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.590 align:start position:0%
four we keep it as is and keep it
as

01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:53.960 align:start position:0%
you okay any um all in favor I anyone
 
01:19:01.229 --> 01:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
good all right another one down moving
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
along moving yeah I mean you think this
 
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
is bad Jackie with that sick how many
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
655 which was two 300 Pages was just
 
01:19:14.390 --> 01:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and it was done the same we
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
actually broke that bill up and had
 
01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
separate subcomittee
 
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
meetings Okay
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
um well I'd like to do section
 
01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.450 align:start position:0%
um well I'd like to do section
five

01:19:25.450 --> 01:19:25.460 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:26.990 align:start position:0%
five
[Music]

01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah apparently so this is short this
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
runs from page four line 29 through line
 
01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
runs from page four line 29 through line
34

01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:35.830 align:start position:0%
34
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:37.430 align:start position:0%
34
[Music]

01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
and and so what was
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
it and this moves the requirement to
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
arrange for the background check from
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
the board to the office that's where it
 
01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
STS out board and ads office and if I
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
could ask it lists inste instead of just
 
01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
saying initial licensure it adds the as
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
a licensed practical nurse registered
 
01:19:59.950 --> 01:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
nurse advanced practice Nur nurse is
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
that just to make it clear or is there I
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
think it was to specify that the LNA
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to do it so if you're not
 
01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
going to move forward with the repeal of
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
the LNA piece we can probably take this
 
01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
s and just leave the rest strike a board
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
and ADD office I think so
 
01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair can I ask for so only for
 
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
LNA that they have to do their own
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
background check how about the nurses
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
and I think there's a m i mean you
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
correct me but well go on you can answer
 
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
if we remove that sentence everyone will
 
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
have to do the background check so I
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
think the idea that Chang is originally
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
it was everybody had to do it but if we
 
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
were going to take out lnas and because
 
01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
they couldn't do a background check for
 
01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
lnas to take them out they then had to
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
list who needed them if that's
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
correct uh uh sir Brown thank you thank
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so yes so if we eliminate
 
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
the Bold part on 31 and 32 then we do
 
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
have a background check for the nursing
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
assistant LNA leaves it in it would be
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
everyone licensed by which solves what
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about thank you let
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
me ask this question if it is if can't
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
we make a rule to say only L's
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
background check will be paid not by the
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
LNA because they're the lowest paid uh
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
that would be done automatically when
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
they do the licensing that's that's well
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
is it paid by the LNA now or or that
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
that is the big contest right but the
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
the issue is if you do that it could be
 
01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:36.760 align:start position:0%
done and again I'd suggest dealing with
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
the the larger thing Jack represent grow
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
is but there's a law that says the
 
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
license the boards they have to be
 
01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
self-funding and so if you're going to
 
01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
have them pay for the background check
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to add it to the
 
01:21:49.709 --> 01:21:49.719 align:start position:0%
licensing fees for the lnas under
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
current statute oh that's a registra
 
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that it's just mood point but if
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
the main reason we are trying to cut the
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
cost for them right that is if there's a
 
01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.510 align:start position:0%
cost for them right that is if there's a
way

01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
of voucher give something just for the
 
01:22:06.709 --> 01:22:06.719 align:start position:0%
but then you'd have to specify where the
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
money comes from are you going to have
 
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
licenses for other professions subsidize
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
it do it come from the general
 
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
fund yeah right I mean so that's a
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
larger question and again i' either take
 
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
it as a separate bill or part of
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
Representative grotus thing okay yeah
 
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.390 align:start position:0%
Representative grotus thing okay yeah
certainly

01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
oh go on I
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
was okay that's
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
fine okay I will here's my question
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
if is there any harm in leaving this in
 
01:22:39.629 --> 01:22:39.639 align:start position:0%
the way it is the bolded section yeah
 
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
because it it will no longer require
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
that the lnas have a background check
 
01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
which I thought people were concerned
 
01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
about for initial licensure as a
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
licensed practical because lnas aren't
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
in that list shall submit to the board a
 
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
criminal history record release form but
 
01:22:56.189 --> 01:22:56.199 align:start position:0%
lnas aren't in the list oh so we would
 
01:22:58.350 --> 01:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
have to add the LNA back in here so
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
here's my concern if Jackie works out
 
01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
some different
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
language is there a way we can write
 
01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
this that isn't harmful but will cover
 
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
us if Jackie works out another way to
 
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
eliminate the duplicate of license yeah
 
01:23:14.669 --> 01:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
Jack I mean in another bill you can make
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
that we don't have we don't have to do
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
anything here I know we don't have to
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
but what I'm saying is we can save
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
ourselves a lot of trouble if we add
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
licensed nurse in here I would actually
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
say it would save us trouble and Jackie
 
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
not to do that the only reason is if
 
01:23:30.669 --> 01:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
let's say they
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
decide you know what represent M py
 
01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
wanted so they're going to they're going
 
01:23:37.510 --> 01:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
to say we're going to pay for the lna's
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
background checks from something the
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
general fund or whever right then all
 
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
they would have to do as part of that
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
bill is uh is add this line okay back
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
you know they can add it in and we're
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
not going to add it in so we're going to
 
01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
leave it they could just change the
 
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:51.719 align:start position:0%
statute as this would but we're not all
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
right you're going to have conflicting
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
changes I hear you so we're taking that
 
01:23:59.229 --> 01:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
out instead of this laundry list said LI
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
or registration well that's actually
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
another well because under 541a they
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
consider under 541a they consider
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
yeah just just for a curios how many l
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
do we have in the state approximately
 
01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.149 align:start position:0%
do we have in the state approximately
about

01:24:21.149 --> 01:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
20,000 huh what I we have 12,000 lnas
 
01:24:29.709 --> 01:24:29.719 align:start position:0%
and um of the 12,000 there's
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
approximately 1,000 that are m&amp;as but
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
under our board we have just shy of
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
total yeah so there's 12,000 total
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
lnas and of the 12,000 1,000 of them are
 
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
lnas and
 
01:24:58.109 --> 01:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
m&amp;as okay um representative
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:06.189 --> 01:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
motion yeah what it would be would be to
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
to take to right to to remove the Bold
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
in those two lines second I I would make
 
01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
32 that's P yeah page four yeah make a
 
01:25:20.189 --> 01:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
motion am I do what sorry I just want to
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
take some notes line 31 to 32 to and
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
your motion is motion is that we
 
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
amend page four line 31 and 32 removing
 
01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:31.870 align:start position:0%
amend page four line 31 and 32 removing
the

01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
Bold type which is added information
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
leaving it as it was in RSA 321 326
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
b151 okay accepting the changes of board
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
to office board to office right right
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%

01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
article um all right so that was five
 
01:27:10.750 --> 01:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
what else have we
 
01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:12.590 align:start position:0%
what else have we

01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
certainly what do the background check
 
01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.830 align:start position:0%
certainly what do the background check
cost

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
just about $25 okay thank you oh it's
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
still 25 this is 12 years AG 8 25 sorry
 
01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
what 4825 4825 yeah I was thinking it
 
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
was 12 years ago 15 years ago 25 $482
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
$48.25 we we got a precise out oh we
 
01:27:38.109 --> 01:27:38.119 align:start position:0%
have the the real
 
01:27:41.229 --> 01:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
EST um I apologize that's because we do
 
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
a state only which is 25 and then the
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
federal background check which is the
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
additional fee so it's a total of
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
4825 nothing I didn't think I fully made
 
01:27:51.119 --> 01:27:52.910 align:start position:0%
4825 nothing I didn't think I fully made
that

01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
um okay so what I'd suggest doing now is
 
01:27:59.270 --> 01:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
can I can I interrupt real quick
 
01:28:02.109 --> 01:28:02.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh page four line 37 we
 
01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
changed lure to registration but if it's
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
going to stay lure we could probably not
 
01:28:09.109 --> 01:28:09.119 align:start position:0%
do that change as
 
01:28:09.119 --> 01:28:11.030 align:start position:0%
do that change as
well

01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:19.400 align:start position:0%
oh ah is that the only thing in section
 
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
six no there's a bunch of I haven't
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
turned the page yet we'll have to we'll
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
deal with Section six and okay we can do
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
that there but thank you oh I didn't I
 
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
thought you were flipping Pages sorry no
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for for pointing that out um
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's why you're here and I'd like
 
01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
clarification on the whole registration
 
01:28:39.149 --> 01:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
versus license is it currently a dual
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
licensing procedure that's happening as
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
soon as the LNA passes their
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
certification they're put on the
 
01:28:47.790 --> 01:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
registry but they can't practice in the
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
state until they get that Ling second
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
level of licing
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
so yes so currently it really is a
 
01:29:00.189 --> 01:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
registration and a license yes the
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
onlyc yeah registration occurs when
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
you're put in the registry I
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
guess all right um so this one the next
 
01:29:10.990 --> 01:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do is something
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
different and that is section two which
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
is dealing with the um among other
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
things the membership of the Board of
 
01:29:20.750 --> 01:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
Nursing can I make a quick statement
 
01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
about this absolutely the language here
 
01:29:26.669 --> 01:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
was actually already approved
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
by House and Senate Edna last year but
 
01:29:32.830 --> 01:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
because there were so many bills uh
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
floating around hb2 655 409 at one point
 
01:29:40.470 --> 01:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
after this was approved another bill
 
01:29:42.270 --> 01:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
retroactively changed it back to what it
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
was oh I remember that so I think I
 
01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
think it was SP 107 that may or may not
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
have been my fault uh which is why I'm
 
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
aware of it but I I want to point out
 
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
that this has already been approved by
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that but given that we're
 
01:29:59.470 --> 01:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
not bound by what we we ourselves did
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
last year it might be helpful I I
 
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:03.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate that that's good
 
01:30:06.910 --> 01:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
information um so first of all does
 
01:30:09.149 --> 01:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
anyone I'm going to ask people you know
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
to see who have an opinion on or any
 
01:30:13.709 --> 01:30:13.719 align:start position:0%
issue with this I'm okay with it and we
 
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
actually voted for it last year which
 
01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
page oh I'm sorry uh page one starting
 
01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:20.830 align:start position:0%
page oh I'm sorry uh page one starting
at

01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
line seven no six uh six actually page
 
01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.550 --> 01:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
22 and we can go through what it does U
 
01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
maybe there's somebody here from if
 
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
you'd like
 
01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
to um again Samantha O'Neal chair of the
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
board um we have the board has a concern
 
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
about decreasing the number of um board
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
members um and in March of 2023 three uh
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
we were actually approved to increase
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
our board numbers uh from 11 to
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
13 um we have I have been on the board
 
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
since September 2017 and during my
 
01:31:08.229 --> 01:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
tenure on the board we have not had any
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
issues with the Quorum whether it be our
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
monthly meetings if we have a special
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
meeting or if we have emergency hearings
 
01:31:19.149 --> 01:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
our board is um obviously voluntary and
 
01:31:22.030 --> 01:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
very committed to their service they
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
come prepared uh we don't have an issue
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
at all with the Quorum um but in
 
01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
addition to that each of our board
 
01:31:32.510 --> 01:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
members have a have a specialty and so
 
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
that is very important when we're
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
looking at best practice um clinical
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
practice you know we have myself as
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
human resources we have someone we have
 
01:31:45.109 --> 01:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
multiple people who are hospital setting
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
APRN Home Care uh long-term care
 
01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:52.760 align:start position:0%
facility uh ambulatory and each one one
 
01:31:55.709 --> 01:31:55.719 align:start position:0%
um brings a level of expertise that not
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
the other one has so you can tap into
 
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
that individual's expertise and
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge to be able to make sound
 
01:32:05.950 --> 01:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
decisions when we're addressing lenses
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
and what their particular matter is
 
01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
that's before us um and if we change
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
that you know it's different saying I'm
 
01:32:13.709 --> 01:32:13.719 align:start position:0%
going to fire you because you're not
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
doing a good job that's much different
 
01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
then we're going to suspend or put your
 
01:32:21.030 --> 01:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
license on probation or revoke a license
 
01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
because you've done something without
 
01:32:25.229 --> 01:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
having that level of expertise from our
 
01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
various board members okay could someone
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
from oplc if they want director Courtney
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
or someone else who would comment on
 
01:32:35.070 --> 01:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
this and somebody will have to give her
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
some room she can kick somebody out
 
01:32:43.709 --> 01:32:43.719 align:start position:0%
bad she's the boss so the only positive
 
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
thing is I get to say where I want
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you lindsy Courtney executive
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
director oplc I would I mean I would
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
agree with chair O'Neal's uh
 
01:32:56.350 --> 01:32:56.360 align:start position:0%
observations I think that we certainly
 
01:32:59.950 --> 01:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
have boards that have Quorum issues and
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
or issues with engagement in the sense
 
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
that you know they're not reviewing the
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
materials and they're not actively
 
01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
participating they're playing Candy
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
Crush while they no joke um while while
 
01:33:15.629 --> 01:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
there's a hearing um that is not an
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
issue for the Board of Nursing at all um
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
I would say that they uh their packets
 
01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
are more jam-packed than any other board
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
you know if you print it out it's like
 
01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:29.719 align:start position:0%
this um over a thousand Pages they have
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
more hearings than anybody else they
 
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
take it very
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
seriously um and so from that standpoint
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have any concerns at the office
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
about their ability to get business done
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
okay Mr chair sir question if I could
 
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
just get some a little something here
 
01:33:50.830 --> 01:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
first uh for understanding and um so in
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh Roman one of this that's just that's
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
changing the
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
membership well also there's and taking
 
01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
out the line any interested individual
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
whatever is that just because that isn't
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
necessary or what's the deal with that
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
section being removed line on lines nine
 
01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:06.990 align:start position:0%
section being removed line on lines nine
and

01:34:06.990 --> 01:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
10 so I think that language I mean is
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
not necessary yeah because anybody can
 
01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
make any recommendation to the governor
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
and ultimately it's up to him so I think
 
01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
that's probably why that was removed
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay it just complicates things for no
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
good reason that was kind of my take on
 
01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
it all right and so but otherwise what
 
01:34:28.639 --> 01:34:30.790 align:start position:0%
it all right and so but otherwise what
this

01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.229 --> 01:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
is yeah yeah well and also who the
 
01:34:37.109 --> 01:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
members are so if we if we got rid of
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
this it would go to the current thing
 
01:34:42.550 --> 01:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
which is 13 members appointed correct
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
and right now it's uh six registered
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
nurses uh two now you're taking out of
 
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
whom Shelby is that just redundant
 
01:34:55.590 --> 01:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
language So currently aprns have to
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
maintain lure as an RN as well so this
 
01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
says currently in law you have to have
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
six RNs two of whom shall be
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
aprns okay so why would but but why was
 
01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
the of whom shall be I mean that
 
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise that Clause isn't changed
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
that's all that's taken out I mean maybe
 
01:35:17.709 --> 01:35:17.719 align:start position:0%
it isn't necessary but that's weird well
 
01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
I I think it no no well I think it just
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
makes clear that you've got a certain
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
number of aprns certain number of RNs
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay um I just trying to clean up the
 
01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
language just clean it up so I mean
 
01:35:34.109 --> 01:35:34.119 align:start position:0%
having even it sounds to me like these
 
01:35:35.709 --> 01:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
two things I just talked about leaving
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
those deletions in there even if we
 
01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
leave everything else the same makes
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
sense well I think if you wanted to
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
clean up the language and maintain the
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
existing composition of the bo you could
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
just say the members of the board shall
 
01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
include four aprns two a you know two
 
01:35:53.550 --> 01:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
aprns two two LPN three l or we could
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
just get or you could just get rid of
 
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
this whole section correct which would
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
be simpler which I'm a big fan of but um
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
oh the other one
 
01:36:04.590 --> 01:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:36:07.629 --> 01:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
L oh I see that's just because you went
 
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
from plural to singular on line 12 I'm
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
just looking at what I'm looking to see
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
and okay and I mean I get to people's
 
01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
questions on the committee but but just
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
quickly is there anybody here who has an
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
objection to leaving the this um makeup
 
01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
of the board the same as it is now and
 
01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
part okay um and questions on the sub my
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
only question U Mr chair is are you
 
01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:46.360 align:start position:0%
saying was had one pending oh so she
 
01:36:48.709 --> 01:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
still has it with your board board
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
members do you use both hybrid if in
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
case they can do Zoom versus all in
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
person that flexibility might give a lot
 
01:37:02.669 --> 01:37:02.679 align:start position:0%
more compliance for core correct do you
 
01:37:02.679 --> 01:37:03.669 align:start position:0%
more compliance for core correct do you
use

01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
hybrid okay yes I would say this board
 
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
does not have a problem though meeting
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
Quorum under any circumstance I think
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
that they try to attend in person
 
01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
because it's more you know it's easier
 
01:37:18.870 --> 01:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
but um but yeah absolutely they they
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
have some members that attend remotely
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
for various issues as authorized it it's
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that if I'm an RN and
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'm on you know don't get out on time at
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
3 but there is a board meeting at least
 
01:37:34.310 --> 01:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
I can call in and be participatory yes
 
01:37:37.229 --> 01:37:37.239 align:start position:0%
then driving up for an hour certainly
 
01:37:40.990 --> 01:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
although their meetings last all day so
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
they they
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
typically um have the day you know they
 
01:37:47.950 --> 01:37:47.960 align:start position:0%
take the day but absolutely absolutely
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
did I miss anything representative
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
G thank you Mr chair um I I just wanted
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
a clarification of what you were saying
 
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
in terms
 
01:37:59.550 --> 01:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
of get rid of the section are you saying
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to get rid of the whole
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
section no no no I I mean removing it
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
from the amendment and well actually
 
01:38:06.709 --> 01:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
we'd have we wouldn't really do that
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
sorry because this is to make it read as
 
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
this so we would we would make it go
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
back to what's in statute so so from
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
line six through well eight eight
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
actually well eight seven eight or no it
 
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
starts at well eight actually or six yes
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
six through 15 through 15 we would
 
01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
just do away with the cross outs and do
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
away with the Bold additions all the
 
01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
changes and so it goes back to the the
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
current text of the statute that's what
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
I'm intending so but I if I heard it
 
01:38:45.149 --> 01:38:45.159 align:start position:0%
correctly the board wanted to go from
 
01:38:48.109 --> 01:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
Seven member to 13 but but in current
 
01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
statute it's 13 the amendment was to
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
drop it to seven oh okay okay got it I
 
01:38:54.669 --> 01:38:54.679 align:start position:0%
guess the only other question director
 
01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
Courtney is you know what was the
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
original impetus for this section so I
 
01:39:02.350 --> 01:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
think if you recall back in
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
hb2 um the original
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
version um last year the governor had
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
proposed completely reducing the size of
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much every board to five or seven
 
01:39:20.189 --> 01:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
and the impetus was really just
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
generally there's a um challenge with
 
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retaining public
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
members so by reducing the size you
 
01:39:31.629 --> 01:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
reduce the number to one public member
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
again that hasn't been an issue for this
 
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
specific board but um but I think that
 
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
was the general just okay so it was a
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
broad brush and correct right and and if
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
you look in uh the calendar that house
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
calendar just came out there's a member
 
01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
notice in there that's going to point
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully Point people at you thank you
 
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
we finally got in I appreciate it we'll
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
see if it works um um any other
 
01:39:57.070 --> 01:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
questions uh so uh for you yes so
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
process-wise we would just remove this
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
entire section well the changes to it be
 
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
but because on line seven or Line 6 it
 
01:40:11.950 --> 01:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
says amend RSA 32 326 B3 to read as
 
01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
follows if we actually remove the
 
01:40:15.629 --> 01:40:15.639 align:start position:0%
section that means we would delete it
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
from statute which is not what we want
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
to do because then there'd be no members
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
on the board as the the newest and most
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
naive member of this committee I I would
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
say that doesn't look like the case but
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
well actually it's kind of the the way
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay to read these things what happens
 
01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
is we're telling we're telling whoever
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
modifies the statutes is take 326 B3 and
 
01:40:39.149 --> 01:40:39.159 align:start position:0%
rip it out and replace it with what we
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
provide here and if what we provide here
 
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't have section one there will be
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
no members on the board and I don't
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
think that'll work well no if
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
we if we remove the ENT entire section
 
01:40:54.109 --> 01:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
no one even considers a change to the
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
RSA right no wrong okay thank you no
 
01:40:58.510 --> 01:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
we're actually telling them remove all
 
01:41:01.229 --> 01:41:01.239 align:start position:0%
of the current RSA section and replace
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
it with what's in the bill understood
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
okay so basically saying no board don't
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
no members no appointment that's would
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
not work so may I just ask clarification
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I could be wrong but I
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
think if you just delete the entire
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
section um regarding nursing assistant
 
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
we would just stay the course under
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
existing statute and if the committee
 
01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to make changes to
 
01:41:31.950 --> 01:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
326b obviously that's when you would um
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
well there's other changes Down Below in
 
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
other sections which we're going to talk
 
01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
about we haven't talked about yet so
 
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
that's I mean you know excellent if we
 
01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to get rid of all of section two
 
01:41:42.669 --> 01:41:42.679 align:start position:0%
that'd be fine and if it turns out in
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
discussion we decide to get rid of all
 
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
the changes there then fine then we'll
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
get rid of the whole section you just
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
kill a bill okay but I'm I'm I I'm not
 
01:41:53.550 --> 01:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
anticipating we'll do that understood
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for that clarification
 
01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
represent and so what I'd like to do is
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
um because there's pieces here that have
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
different effects and meanings not just
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
on the me you know I would like to just
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
take a very quick vote are people fine
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
with leaving the membership of the board
 
01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
as specified in section one uh Roman one
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
of section two alone the way it is in
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
statute today so that's my motion what
 
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
you're basically saying is
 
01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
nothing is going to be struck correct
 
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
all the
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
struck no added no nothing okay so it'll
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
all come back up all right so okay um so
 
01:42:33.790 --> 01:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
let me let me record this or at the end
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
of the day I will never remember what we
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
did and I will never be go back to what
 
01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
it was without the strike stay the same
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
correct um actually not not remove but
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
revert basically all right all right um
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
all in favor
 
01:42:55.709 --> 01:42:55.719 align:start position:0%
anyone opposed no good all right
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
is I think I had myself I did it and and
 
01:43:06.910 --> 01:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
representative Brown we're all set okay
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
so section two it looks like all it's
 
01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
doing is where it specifies RN it's
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
going to allow an APRN is
 
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
that um so be and it's the rest is the
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
same is that my understanding corre
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
correct that's Roman two of section two
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
uh line 16 through 20 of page one oh oh
 
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
correct I think it just makes clear what
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
the requirements are for to be an APRN
 
01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
member of the board does anybody here
 
01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
have an objection to that change I mean
 
01:43:41.790 --> 01:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
anyone Okay cool so uh yeah I think we
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
may combine other things but we will
 
01:43:47.990 --> 01:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
remember we agreed to that um and then
 
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.669 align:start position:0%
remember we agreed to that um and then
section

01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
two uh
 
01:43:55.629 --> 01:43:55.639 align:start position:0%
four three oh oh actually we do need to
 
01:43:57.270 --> 01:43:57.280 align:start position:0%
make some changes yeah they're they're
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
changing the T well they're singular to
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
plural because of the proposed right
 
01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
they're reflecting different number okay
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
but that's not the case
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
for for three yeah
 
01:44:14.229 --> 01:44:14.239 align:start position:0%
and um and then
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
four uh actually it's got it goes from
 
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
members to member which is a problem
 
01:44:23.589 --> 01:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
residents to Res that's a a resident so
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
from mple to single but what it's also
 
01:44:27.589 --> 01:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
doing is it's striking these members
 
01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:29.239 align:start position:0%
shall have a minimum of five years
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
experiences in LNA at least three of
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
which shall have immediately preceded
 
01:44:34.830 --> 01:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
the date of their appointment I see
 
01:44:37.229 --> 01:44:37.239 align:start position:0%
that's being removed and that's and
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
what's I can guess but what's the the
 
01:44:41.709 --> 01:44:41.719 align:start position:0%
reason for
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
that I would just guess and so I don't
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
want to guess um I think it would be to
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
open up membership I would say though
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
that I think and I can't speak for the
 
01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
board I think the board has a concern
 
01:44:54.990 --> 01:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
about that I think for my own
 
01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.229 align:start position:0%
about that I think for my own
observation

01:44:58.229 --> 01:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
um I I I think it's important to keep
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
that restriction in many lnas um become
 
01:45:08.589 --> 01:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
lnas and stay Lenas for a very limited
 
01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:11.480 align:start position:0%
period of time just for various reasons
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
and I think uh to to really be able to
 
01:45:17.709 --> 01:45:17.719 align:start position:0%
offer experience um that you need on a
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory board you need some
 
01:45:21.189 --> 01:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
experience can we can we get a comment
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.709 --> 01:45:28.719 align:start position:0%
that um we agree that we we would like
 
01:45:30.669 --> 01:45:30.679 align:start position:0%
to leave that requirement in there for
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
the reasons that director Courtney
 
01:45:35.470 --> 01:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
stated um and we have actually with me
 
01:45:37.709 --> 01:45:37.719 align:start position:0%
today is one of our LNA board members
 
01:45:40.750 --> 01:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
who her career is LNA um if you want to
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
hear directly from her as to why she
 
01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
feels that's important I don't need to
 
01:45:47.149 --> 01:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
but someone else might but so is there
 
01:45:51.589 --> 01:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
anybody here who um who wants to remove
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
this requirement uh I would out here
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
first just and then we'll talk about it
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
I just want to get testimony from people
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
if sounds like nobody so from the
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee represent what I'm thinking
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
is if I understood the process for LNA
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
somebody could be on the registry never
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
worked as LNA didn't get license didn't
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
have experience but because they are LNA
 
01:46:17.390 --> 01:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
they can be on the board so their input
 
01:46:21.070 --> 01:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
would not be as valuable relevant not
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
Val relevant to practicing elen yes
 
01:46:26.669 --> 01:46:26.679 align:start position:0%
correct correct yes and that's a very
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
good point thank you okay thank you yeah
 
01:46:31.709 --> 01:46:31.719 align:start position:0%
my my guess which apparently is wrong is
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
that uh lnas wouldn't stay as lnas for
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
long that they would advance but if
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
there are people who are making LNA as
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
their career then yeah that makes sense
 
01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh anyone else because uh well
 
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
what I would propose and and we'll group
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
them together as far as voting is to
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
actually um leave leave U Roman 4 alone
 
01:46:55.950 --> 01:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
to not to remove all the changes and
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
that would uh because we're leaving the
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
members of the board alone it would
 
01:47:01.550 --> 01:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
leave the the tense you know the uh the
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
singular plural thing go back to what
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's in statute and we would leave this
 
01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
and U yeah it's all the
 
01:47:15.119 --> 01:47:16.669 align:start position:0%
and U yeah it's all the
same

01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
right right so three four and five I'm
 
01:47:21.629 --> 01:47:21.639 align:start position:0%
looking at five
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
and yeah a
 
01:47:23.280 --> 01:47:24.350 align:start position:0%
and yeah a
[Music]

01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
five so
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
Brown the to basically leave three four
 
01:47:37.709 --> 01:47:37.719 align:start position:0%
and five alone is that that okay I
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:42.719 --> 01:47:44.229 align:start position:0%
 
revert

01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
revert
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
um page one lines
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
21 through page two
 
01:47:51.199 --> 01:47:53.310 align:start position:0%
21 through page two
line

01:47:53.310 --> 01:47:53.320 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:47:57.550 --> 01:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
three um and that was
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
brown and
 
01:48:03.589 --> 01:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
Gould and uh anyone all in
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
favor anyone opposed no okay
 
01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
cool all right so we got
 
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
that and then
 
01:48:17.390 --> 01:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
um and then we've
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
got um on page two starting at line four
 
01:48:21.239 --> 01:48:22.669 align:start position:0%
got um on page two starting at line four
Roman

01:48:22.669 --> 01:48:22.679 align:start position:0%
Roman
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
6 no more than two board members should
 
01:48:26.830 --> 01:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
be associated with any particular
 
01:48:30.669 --> 01:48:30.679 align:start position:0%
agency anyone here opposed to
 
01:48:33.149 --> 01:48:33.159 align:start position:0%
this any question I that seems
 
01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable to me sorry oh No actually
 
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's not a change I apologize so
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
actually the rest down to line 13 where
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
things are struck out it's unchanged
 
01:48:45.629 --> 01:48:45.639 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine thank
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
so if you could if someone director
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
Courtney what is the deal with striking
 
01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
out uh Roman 91 and
 
01:49:00.990 --> 01:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
11 last year in s SP 107 we drafted
 
01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
language that was applicable to all the
 
01:49:04.270 --> 01:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
boards so this is basically redundant
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
language now okay okay
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
um quick question last year's uh leg
 
01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:15.310 align:start position:0%
um quick question last year's uh leg
last

01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:49:17.950 --> 01:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
legislative has it made it to the ru
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
making yet or it's in the process it's
 
01:49:20.830 --> 01:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:49:24.229 --> 01:49:24.239 align:start position:0%
statute so there's no Ru making
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
so would you like motion yeah and and
 
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
give me a moment to to write some things
 
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
down um what I the motion I'd like is um
 
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise I have the two things about
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
reverting those
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
um two sections and I would say
 
01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:43.590 align:start position:0%
otherwise um
 
01:49:43.590 --> 01:49:45.830 align:start position:0%
otherwise um
[Music]

01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%

01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
leave um section
 
01:49:49.119 --> 01:49:52.310 align:start position:0%
leave um section

01:49:53.870 --> 01:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh as
 
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
is if somebody can make that motion that
 
01:50:02.189 --> 01:50:02.199 align:start position:0%
was uh M py or somebody want to Second
 
01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:10.840 align:start position:0%

certainly so we're talking
 
01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.030 align:start position:0%
certainly so we're talking
about

01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:50:24.629 --> 01:50:24.639 align:start position:0%
except for what we just discussed around
 
01:50:27.870 --> 01:50:27.880 align:start position:0%
section one and sections three four and
 
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
gonna a microphone please thank sorry
 
01:50:40.270 --> 01:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
that we're keep my notes say that we're
 
01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:42.280 align:start position:0%
we're keeping the
 
01:50:45.629 --> 01:50:45.639 align:start position:0%
same line six through 18 we're going to
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
leave what's in the bill the same yep or
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:54.069 --> 01:50:54.079 align:start position:0%
let's let's try to get the same
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
terminology so we're say we're saying
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
the same thing deleting from the bill
 
01:51:01.790 --> 01:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
and deleting from statute so let me go
 
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
through and see and I'll go through it
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
and make sure with what I'm saying yeah
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
um that Roman one uh we're going to
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
revert to current statute which is 13
 
01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
members y right all those changes go
 
01:51:21.589 --> 01:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
away correct and the same thing is the
 
01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:24.280 align:start position:0%
case for Roman Roman 2 will leave us is
 
01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
in the bill Roman Roman Ro Roman two
 
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:32.040 align:start position:0%

01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
bill correct keep the change and all
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we're saying treating
 
01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
APRN is equivalent to right right no I'm
 
01:51:41.149 --> 01:51:41.159 align:start position:0%
good okay so that'll stay as in the bill
 
01:51:44.189 --> 01:51:44.199 align:start position:0%
yep sections 3 four
 
01:51:44.199 --> 01:51:45.830 align:start position:0%
yep sections 3 four
five

01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
um right and actually with throwing up
 
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
the changes four 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 11
 
01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
will all remain as in the bill correct
 
01:51:57.790 --> 01:51:57.800 align:start position:0%
no changes Oh No actually that's not
 
01:52:00.990 --> 01:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
true I apologize because I miss I missed
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
three four and five will revert to
 
01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
current statute correct and 6 7 8 9 10
 
01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
and 11 will revert to current to will
 
01:52:14.109 --> 01:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
stay as in the bill yeah yeah yeah that
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
works 9 11 that works and we want we
 
01:52:20.669 --> 01:52:20.679 align:start position:0%
want to keep striking the that's yeah so
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
as I understand it that's the
 
01:52:25.709 --> 01:52:25.719 align:start position:0%
motion thank you thank you Mr chair well
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
the the bill would strike them from
 
01:52:27.679 --> 01:52:30.870 align:start position:0%
the the bill would strike them from
current

01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
statute already done previous Bill had
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
done done it's
 
01:52:39.910 --> 01:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
just um no it didn't do it in correct me
 
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong it didn't strike it in from
 
01:52:45.149 --> 01:52:45.159 align:start position:0%
this part of the RSA it it added it to a
 
01:52:47.069 --> 01:52:47.079 align:start position:0%
higher level that applied to
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
everything correct it's it's it's in our
 
01:52:53.709 --> 01:52:53.719 align:start position:0%
our a 310 yeah which is the overall
 
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
oplc correct correct I mean you don't
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
need to but to make it nice and neat for
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
us you end up with nightmares like if
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
some future legislature changes the one
 
01:53:04.270 --> 01:53:04.280 align:start position:0%
in 310 then this will stay in here and
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
there'll be generate a conflict which is
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
Ood that was my mistake Mr sorry okay so
 
01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
um if we
 
01:53:14.589 --> 01:53:14.599 align:start position:0%
understand if we understand what we're
 
01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:18.880 align:start position:0%
voting on uh all in favor I all all
 
01:53:22.069 --> 01:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
opposed none all right all right thank
 
01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
you um so I think that finishes section
 
01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
two um
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
so we're done with one
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
two we're done with
 
01:53:39.069 --> 01:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
three we're we're done with uh I'm sure
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
we're done four but let me
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
go let me let me take a look back we did
 
01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
four we did four we
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
did five
 
01:53:53.109 --> 01:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
we were going to get into six so we're
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
six and maybe future such bills could be
 
01:54:04.830 --> 01:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
SE I don't know it's actually more work
 
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
if they're separate bills I guess but
 
01:54:10.030 --> 01:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
okay so what is this doing this I'm
 
01:54:12.950 --> 01:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
sorry uh we're starting at page four
 
01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:14.669 align:start position:0%
sorry uh we're starting at page four
line

01:54:14.669 --> 01:54:14.679 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
35 and
 
01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
continuing where does seven star starts
 
01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
at line 36 page 5 um okay oh yeah I'm
 
01:54:25.830 --> 01:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
missing it because it's right at the
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page all right
 
01:54:29.159 --> 01:54:31.870 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page all right
um

01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:36.510 --> 01:54:36.520 align:start position:0%
so if I mean okay I know
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh attorney mister I don't know what's
 
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate but ostra house hey you Doug
 
01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
no we've been dealing a lot together I
 
01:54:46.669 --> 01:54:46.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to be
 
01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:50.360 align:start position:0%
disrespectful but um so
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned that um there's an
 
01:54:56.830 --> 01:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
issue something needs to change here
 
01:55:01.629 --> 01:55:01.639 align:start position:0%
because we kept the um the L stuff
 
01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
correct because you didn't do away with
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
the LNA is that only line 37 well I
 
01:55:07.870 --> 01:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
haven't turned the page yet okay you're
 
01:55:13.069 --> 01:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
page it's not that late we shouldn't be
 
01:55:17.709 --> 01:55:17.719 align:start position:0%
getting silly and that's me that's on me
 
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah if I might yeah it looks like
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
line the deletion on line seven and8
 
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
will have to remain
 
01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
um because they still can't apply for
 
01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:34.030 align:start position:0%
um because they still can't apply for
[Music]

01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
license right so
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
we so what is this doing so the first um
 
01:55:42.270 --> 01:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
let's go through this so the first part
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
is on line 37 on page four is just there
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
be because of section one right director
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
Courtney actually has a recommendation
 
01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
that most of these changes were just to
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
Common compliance with cfrs but we can
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
probably do away with all of section six
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
um yeah we just right whole section out
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
bill and so other so there's two things
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
there's the dealing with the fact that
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
the elenas were going to go away the
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
license we're going to keep lnas um and
 
01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
and to become in compliance with cfrs
 
01:56:15.069 --> 01:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
but do we need the language to come in
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
compliance with
 
01:56:22.109 --> 01:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
cfrs no so the New Hampshire um this
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
statute was very artfully crafted as is
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
what artfully crafted to be in
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
compliance with the Federal cfrs in the
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
sense that in order to be on the
 
01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
registry you have to have quote taken a
 
01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:36.800 align:start position:0%
state approved Nursing Registry
 
01:56:39.069 --> 01:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
assistant program so during the state of
 
01:56:42.589 --> 01:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
emergency and then thereafter um this
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
language basically States you shall be
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
deemed to have taken a program if you
 
01:56:50.830 --> 01:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
you know if you have certain um a
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
certain mos in in in the military
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
service so I don't think we should mess
 
01:56:58.430 --> 01:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
too much with it it the the changes are
 
01:57:01.470 --> 01:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
intended to allow somebody on the
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
registry to if you were doing away with
 
01:57:06.430 --> 01:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
ler to also continue to satisfy and be
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
placed on the registry but if you're no
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
longer making that change you don't need
 
01:57:12.990 --> 01:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
any of these changes that are in section
 
01:57:16.189 --> 01:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
six okay um I just wouldn't want to mess
 
01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
with the Lure by alternate experience
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
right um so I'm going to make a motion
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
then we'll have discussion and my motion
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
is that we remove section six from the
 
01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:29.360 align:start position:0%
bill and now we can have in a second a
 
01:57:32.189 --> 01:57:32.199 align:start position:0%
second remove by removing it from the
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
bill then you remove the changes I know
 
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
the language is funny
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's well see because what it does is it
 
01:57:43.709 --> 01:57:43.719 align:start position:0%
says nurse
 
01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
practice it says there's a SE if you
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
take out section
 
01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:50.390 align:start position:0%
take out section
six

01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
six
 
01:57:52.270 --> 01:57:52.280 align:start position:0%
representative ghoul if you take out
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
section six you're also you're taking
 
01:57:58.030 --> 01:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
out the part that says amend RSA 326b
 
01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
21-a to read is following if you take
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
that out you're not making any changes
 
01:58:06.189 --> 01:58:06.199 align:start position:0%
to RSA 321 I understand that um Mr chair
 
01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
with all due respect but as you see in
 
01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
other places the the the current statute
 
01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
gets printed out and it's just the
 
01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:16.599 align:start position:0%
changes that wouldn't be in here we
 
01:58:20.109 --> 01:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be removing the section of the
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
chapter from the amendment we would be
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
removing the section from the bill we
 
01:58:28.629 --> 01:58:28.639 align:start position:0%
would not be removing it from statute
 
01:58:34.430 --> 01:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
right um all right so so you did
 
01:58:41.629 --> 01:58:41.639 align:start position:0%
somebody yeah you made the motion I made
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
the okay so me uh and then we can have
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
discussion if there's um just need to
 
01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:52.310 align:start position:0%
discussion if there's um just need to
write

01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
write
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
down okay and discussion representative
 
01:59:01.709 --> 01:59:01.719 align:start position:0%
MTI question since we have an LNA I
 
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
would like to ask if they having licens
 
01:59:09.950 --> 01:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
make them feel more professional or not
 
01:59:13.310 --> 01:59:13.320 align:start position:0%
having license just a simple question
 
01:59:16.350 --> 01:59:16.360 align:start position:0%
sure I know direct care professional got
 
01:59:21.550 --> 01:59:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:25.870 --> 01:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
yes my name is Melissa tle an L um for
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
me and my more seasoned elas the license
 
01:59:33.790 --> 01:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
is very important to us um I know
 
01:59:35.750 --> 01:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's issues with cost and I know a
 
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
lot of us would be willing to cover that
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
cost to keep that license because I know
 
01:59:42.910 --> 01:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
it's a play of words but for us it's our
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
career thank you that that was my and
 
01:59:49.229 --> 01:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
just uh you know just a a a follow up on
 
01:59:51.390 --> 01:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
on that so as I understand it the title
 
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
would still be licensed nursing
 
01:59:57.870 --> 01:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
assistant even if if that part went away
 
02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679 align:start position:0%
I so I'm a little wondering why what's
 
02:00:03.709 --> 02:00:03.719 align:start position:0%
and and also at least what we proposed
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
doing until we ran into the background
 
02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
check issue was that the the training
 
02:00:10.030 --> 02:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
requirement would be the same everything
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
else would be the same you'd still be
 
02:00:13.950 --> 02:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
called in LNA under the law it'd be
 
02:00:15.149 --> 02:00:15.159 align:start position:0%
considered a
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
license um and you just wouldn't have to
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
go through the double process
 
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
I yeah and it's all on player words and
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
everybody it's means something different
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
to the way you word it for us being
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
licensed you go and you see a license
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
number on a registry you're no longer
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
you're just a person just a name there's
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
nothing attached to it so when we search
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
other CNAs in other states it's just a
 
02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
name but when you go on your license you
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
can see your whole history your whole
 
02:00:44.589 --> 02:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
record how long you've been there that
 
02:00:46.109 --> 02:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
goes away when you're on a registry
 
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
because it's just updated every two
 
02:00:48.910 --> 02:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
years okay thanks for helping me
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
understand because I didn't I didn't
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
really get it yeah uh representative
 
02:00:56.069 --> 02:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
Brown so um thank you Mr chair
 
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
yeah clarify for me when when you if
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
you're on the registry you must get a
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
document from oplc that says you are
 
02:01:09.069 --> 02:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
this and is there a number
 
02:01:13.709 --> 02:01:13.719 align:start position:0%
there so I I think the way the state has
 
02:01:16.069 --> 02:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
implemented the registry and The Lure
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
they they historically have complet the
 
02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
two and because lure has been required
 
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been a separate
 
02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
notification that goes out regarding
 
02:01:27.310 --> 02:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
registration but we use the same
 
02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
licensing system and if you pull up
 
02:01:33.149 --> 02:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
somebody's name who is an LNA there will
 
02:01:36.430 --> 02:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
be two entries one it'll say registry
 
02:01:40.149 --> 02:01:40.159 align:start position:0%
only and it'll have a number the other
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
will be licensed nursing assistant and
 
02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
it would have a number I think if we
 
02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
were to operationalize the bill as
 
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
proposed you would just eliminate the
 
02:01:52.069 --> 02:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
registry portion because you would be
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
required to refer to lnas as
 
02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
lnas um that's how we would
 
02:02:00.790 --> 02:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
operationalize it but in practice they
 
02:02:04.069 --> 02:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
do not receive a document right now that
 
02:02:06.589 --> 02:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
says you're on the registry we just we
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
send them the document when they get the
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
license but I think it honestly we
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
probably should be sending both but I
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
think in practice the the the processes
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
have been conflated MH
 
02:02:22.990 --> 02:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions represent Mony yeah
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
in if you're trying to save cost for the
 
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
lnas and we are increasing the cost for
 
02:02:35.629 --> 02:02:35.639 align:start position:0%
oplc if you have to send two cards to
 
02:02:39.790 --> 02:02:39.800 align:start position:0%
think right or is it like Driver's
 
02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
License non- Driving ID non driver's ID
 
02:02:47.069 --> 02:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
so the cost there's really not an
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
additional cost the the issue with the
 
02:02:53.470 --> 02:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
cost is that um to be on the registry
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
we're not permitted to charge anyone to
 
02:02:58.870 --> 02:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
be on the registry because the state is
 
02:03:02.069 --> 02:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
getting funds for the registry now the
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
issue is those funds are not going to
 
02:03:05.550 --> 02:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
the office they're going to the
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:03:10.709 --> 02:03:10.719 align:start position:0%
and we get a very small portion of that
 
02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is because we
 
02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
have this duplicative process I'm not
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
able to parse out and say these expenses
 
02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
are due to their registry but these
 
02:03:23.870 --> 02:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
expenses are due to the L and I think if
 
02:03:25.550 --> 02:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
you were to basically combine the
 
02:03:27.550 --> 02:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
process into one process we could say
 
02:03:30.629 --> 02:03:30.639 align:start position:0%
this entire process is a million dollars
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
please pay up but right now that's not
 
02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's the issue with the cost I mean we
 
02:03:39.390 --> 02:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
certainly you know we we have funding um
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
but that's the issue with the cost it's
 
02:03:44.109 --> 02:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
an allocation issue Mr chair there's the
 
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
answer for the funding yeah just gonna
 
02:03:49.629 --> 02:03:49.639 align:start position:0%
ask so so if we had kept section one
 
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
um and and got rid of the licensing
 
02:03:53.830 --> 02:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
process just kept with certification
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
would that funding basically pay for in
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
effect what you're calling a license for
 
02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:00.189 align:start position:0%
effect what you're calling a license for
the

02:04:00.189 --> 02:04:00.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
lnas yes the other way to handle this is
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
to just eliminate the fee but the money
 
02:04:09.870 --> 02:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
yes and then that the license could be
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
considered the
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
registry and then I could go to HHS and
 
02:04:15.390 --> 02:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
say give me a million dollars but right
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
now I can't you know I mean the bulk of
 
02:04:18.159 --> 02:04:20.109 align:start position:0%
now I can't you know I mean the bulk of
the

02:04:20.109 --> 02:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
the board of nursing a lot of their
 
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
hearings have to do with lnas but I
 
02:04:26.830 --> 02:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
can't say that you know the cost of
 
02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting those cases and
 
02:04:30.149 --> 02:04:30.159 align:start position:0%
investigating those cases is because of
 
02:04:31.870 --> 02:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
the license versus the registration and
 
02:04:34.629 --> 02:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
vice versa so that so practically that's
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
the problem so you're not diluting the
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
standard you're not demoting or you know
 
02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
psychologically you're not saying the
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
Ellen is you're not worthy of Licensing
 
02:04:48.149 --> 02:04:48.159 align:start position:0%
license it's called I mean that be I
 
02:04:50.669 --> 02:04:50.679 align:start position:0%
mean if it weren't for the concerns
 
02:04:52.109 --> 02:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
about the background check issue I would
 
02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
really push to keep section one because
 
02:04:56.229 --> 02:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
it would it would it eliminate the cost
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
to become an LNA they're called license
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to show up on the thing as a
 
02:05:04.149 --> 02:05:04.159 align:start position:0%
license the whole deal um but I think
 
02:05:05.549 --> 02:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
what's standing in the way of it right
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
now is the concern is there's some way
 
02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
to deal that's what I'm saying for the
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
funding for background check if you
 
02:05:13.549 --> 02:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
combine the registry and the license
 
02:05:15.310 --> 02:05:15.320 align:start position:0%
thing and give it to director courney
 
02:05:16.990 --> 02:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
can answer me but I don't think the
 
02:05:19.390 --> 02:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
federal money can be used for background
 
02:05:21.870 --> 02:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
check because they don't they say you
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
they I don't know no it can't be used
 
02:05:25.709 --> 02:05:25.719 align:start position:0%
for the background check um they have to
 
02:05:28.990 --> 02:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
pay the $48.25 so
 
02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
um but what's the application fee well
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
their application fee is $35 but the
 
02:05:38.069 --> 02:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
average cost the average cost of
 
02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
lure is
 
02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
$155 so they the license fee of $35 is
 
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
not covering the $155 cost so be because
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
of overhead and because of staff and
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
because you know all the other things so
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
but to be on the registry we can't even
 
02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
charge them the $35 so you know
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
if if structurally if it were combined
 
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
if the fee were eliminated and we
 
02:06:05.629 --> 02:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
treated it as one process I could go to
 
02:06:08.750 --> 02:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
HHS and say pay me 155 per person I
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
can't do that right now because I can't
 
02:06:12.669 --> 02:06:12.679 align:start position:0%
attribute certain portion of the
 
02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
expenditures to the registry versus the
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
LNA that's the issue with cost so if we
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
could have kept that F that first part
 
02:06:21.790 --> 02:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
then uh Not only would you not have to
 
02:06:24.589 --> 02:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
charge the lnas for the license you
 
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
would stop overcharging all the other
 
02:06:28.549 --> 02:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
nurses to pay for the lna's licenses is
 
02:06:33.229 --> 02:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
that true more or less yes there you go
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
yep that that was my point that is that
 
02:06:38.189 --> 02:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
is probably true I do think there's a
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
different way to deal with it that's not
 
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
statutory which is to just eliminate the
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
fee because we would be in compliance
 
02:06:44.990 --> 02:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
with the federal requirements that we
 
02:06:46.830 --> 02:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
not charge a fee to be on the registry
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
but um but then could you get get the
 
02:06:51.390 --> 02:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
money out of I think I
 
02:06:53.549 --> 02:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
could but you can do that on your own
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
you don't I yes okay thank you
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you Mr chair
 
02:07:02.669 --> 02:07:02.679 align:start position:0%
so going back to the the LNA who's who's
 
02:07:06.549 --> 02:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
here I think it's it it behooves us to
 
02:07:09.830 --> 02:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
be really fair and considerate of the
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
feelings of people who have got an LNA
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
and and they they're proud to have that
 
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
title I I I did this I'm an LNA here's
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
my license and it says that and here's
 
02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:20.470 align:start position:0%
my license and it says that and here's
my

02:07:20.470 --> 02:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:07:24.990 --> 02:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
number am I am I 100% clear that if if
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
this were to move forward as proposed
 
02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
and and the requirement to go through
 
02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
the licensing process is removed you're
 
02:07:34.589 --> 02:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
still going to call them an LNA yeah and
 
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
they will receive some type of a
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
document that says you're an LNA and
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
here's a number which is going to be
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
your registration number and would that
 
02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:44.669 align:start position:0%
your registration number and would that
be

02:07:44.669 --> 02:07:44.679 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:07:48.030 --> 02:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
satisfactory from a making you not feel
 
02:07:49.390 --> 02:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
bad St standpoint and don't take that
 
02:07:50.709 --> 02:07:50.719 align:start position:0%
the wrong way I would say the first part
 
02:07:52.510 --> 02:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
director Courtney can say whether that's
 
02:07:54.910 --> 02:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
true and then how two questions thank
 
02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
you there was a followup yeah no that's
 
02:07:59.589 --> 02:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
fine yes that's true that's how we would
 
02:08:02.390 --> 02:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's how we would do it okay and
 
02:08:05.149 --> 02:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
then so I think what's really important
 
02:08:07.790 --> 02:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day for us as lnas
 
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
it's just as long as the people that we
 
02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
work for that we know they're fully
 
02:08:14.669 --> 02:08:14.679 align:start position:0%
trained competent to do their job we
 
02:08:16.990 --> 02:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
know background checks have been done
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
just because of the people I'm in home
 
02:08:20.870 --> 02:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
care so I'm in people's homes all by
 
02:08:23.910 --> 02:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
myself I know that I am a good person
 
02:08:25.950 --> 02:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't mean the person next to
 
02:08:29.589 --> 02:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
me might be good um so those are our key
 
02:08:31.229 --> 02:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
important things that are important to
 
02:08:33.030 --> 02:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
us regardless we know this is where
 
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to go registry license
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
unlicensed non-licensed we're okay with
 
02:08:39.790 --> 02:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
that it's just the end result is we're
 
02:08:41.790 --> 02:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
protected the people are protected
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
background checks are done and then
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
that's important to us because a lot of
 
02:08:47.549 --> 02:08:47.559 align:start position:0%
us don't get into this for the money we
 
02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
get into it because compassion car we
 
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
want to give back we want to help we
 
02:08:54.109 --> 02:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
want to step in where people
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
cannot okay thank you thank you I
 
02:08:58.189 --> 02:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate that answer thank you so oh
 
02:09:00.109 --> 02:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
representative gold I just want to say
 
02:09:02.350 --> 02:09:02.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for what you do yeah
 
02:09:05.629 --> 02:09:05.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely um so we have the motion to
 
02:09:08.750 --> 02:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
remove section six from the bill leaving
 
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
what's in statute now um do we need any
 
02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:13.109 align:start position:0%
what's in statute now um do we need any
further

02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
discussion okay um no all right so all
 
02:09:19.069 --> 02:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
in favor
 
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
all opposed I don't hear anyone all
 
02:09:26.350 --> 02:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
right great um so that's
 
02:09:28.830 --> 02:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
six we're doing the uh the March through
 
02:09:31.990 --> 02:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
the bill uh that goes down to
 
02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.270 align:start position:0%
the bill uh that goes down to
seven

02:09:34.270 --> 02:09:34.280 align:start position:0%
seven
 
02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
and yeah that's sorry thank you that
 
02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
starts page five line 36 ends at page
 
02:09:42.589 --> 02:09:42.599 align:start position:0%
six line four I see only one change
 
02:09:44.069 --> 02:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
which is another one of the changing
 
02:09:46.589 --> 02:09:46.599 align:start position:0%
board to office on who issues the
 
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
license and all that stuff to accept
 
02:09:51.669 --> 02:09:51.679 align:start position:0%
that change okay that's let me get to
 
02:09:54.690 --> 02:09:54.700 align:start position:0%
make some notes here so that's section
 
02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:56.950 align:start position:0%
make some notes here so that's section

Brown all in favor anyone
 
02:10:14.109 --> 02:10:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
excellent okay
 
02:10:17.239 --> 02:10:19.069 align:start position:0%
excellent okay
um

02:10:19.069 --> 02:10:19.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:22.189 --> 02:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
so Section
 
02:10:25.709 --> 02:10:25.719 align:start position:0%
8 um I think this is another one just
 
02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:34.870 --> 02:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:38.690 --> 02:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
great section eight as
 
02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:40.229 align:start position:0%
great section eight as
[Music]

02:10:40.229 --> 02:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:47.229 --> 02:10:47.239 align:start position:0%
to where's
 
02:10:51.390 --> 02:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
this of of page I we should probably
 
02:10:52.910 --> 02:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
look at that once we've gone through the
 
02:10:55.750 --> 02:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
list in 10 and see if that needs to hang
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
on a moment
 
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
so yeah you got into the next yeah we're
 
02:11:00.880 --> 02:11:01.830 align:start position:0%
so yeah you got into the next yeah we're
on

02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:03.589 align:start position:0%
on
eight

02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
eight
 
02:11:06.109 --> 02:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
oh yeah numbers you got different levels
 
02:11:08.109 --> 02:11:08.119 align:start position:0%
of numbers and Roman numerals and small
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
letters and everything else the only
 
02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
thing I see in eight is on line seven
 
02:11:18.669 --> 02:11:18.679 align:start position:0%
which says the board to office so so the
 
02:11:22.109 --> 02:11:22.119 align:start position:0%
nursing board to
 
02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
oplc that is the only change I see in
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
this section that's my take so I I would
 
02:11:30.549 --> 02:11:30.559 align:start position:0%
make a motion that we accept Section 8
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
as it is
 
02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
written okay all in favor all opposed
 
02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:38.030 align:start position:0%
written okay all in favor all opposed
any

02:11:38.030 --> 02:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:11:41.549 --> 02:11:41.559 align:start position:0%
opposed okay good so that's
 
02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
eight and I think we have two more to go
 
02:11:46.189 --> 02:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
so what is
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
nine uh oh this is the the teleah health
 
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
thing oh and and uh if I could ask
 
02:11:56.310 --> 02:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
director Courtney or someone um and so
 
02:11:58.669 --> 02:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
on page six line
 
02:12:03.149 --> 02:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
18 where it strikes uh 328 I and J is
 
02:12:05.830 --> 02:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
that related to the LNA removal what is
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
that about no so if you look in section
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
10 section 10 proposes to eliminate
 
02:12:13.189 --> 02:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
registration of medical technicians and
 
02:12:16.629 --> 02:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
lure of Medical Imaging um so if you do
 
02:12:18.510 --> 02:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
that then you would need to strike from
 
02:12:20.229 --> 02:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
our statute their ability to provide
 
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
tele Health Services okay I get that um
 
02:12:24.990 --> 02:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
so I think then the next thing which I I
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
know there's actually two issues here
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's the which we need to I'd like to
 
02:12:31.790 --> 02:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
disentangle anyway that's the
 
02:12:33.950 --> 02:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
registration of medical
 
02:12:36.589 --> 02:12:36.599 align:start position:0%
technicians which correct me if I'm
 
02:12:36.599 --> 02:12:37.990 align:start position:0%
technicians which correct me if I'm
wrong

02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
02:12:41.669 --> 02:12:41.679 align:start position:0%
that's um in section 10
 
02:12:46.990 --> 02:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
lines 22 through 24 is it anything else
 
02:12:50.189 --> 02:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
is just a radial biology technicians no
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
well this is there's medical technicians
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
and then there's the radiation therapy
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
and Medical Imaging and I'd like to deal
 
02:12:59.350 --> 02:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
with them separately because at least
 
02:13:00.549 --> 02:13:00.559 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking we might want to do
 
02:13:04.109 --> 02:13:04.119 align:start position:0%
different things yes section um lines 22
 
02:13:07.990 --> 02:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
to 24 are just medical technicians okay
 
02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.310 align:start position:0%
to 24 are just medical technicians okay
and

02:13:11.310 --> 02:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:20.910 --> 02:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
10 so so um as and i' I've been involved
 
02:13:22.510 --> 02:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
in this issue for some years as I just
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
to get things set up as I understand it
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
um you know first of all what does
 
02:13:31.390 --> 02:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
medical technicians cover I'd like you
 
02:13:35.069 --> 02:13:35.079 align:start position:0%
know what that know what that is um
 
02:13:37.470 --> 02:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
and what is the reg what's the effect of
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
the registration other than they
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
actually just have to there's some list
 
02:13:43.069 --> 02:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
of their names and presumably address
 
02:13:45.470 --> 02:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
and whatever is that yes I can cover
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
that representativ so generally a
 
02:13:48.239 --> 02:13:49.149 align:start position:0%
that representativ so generally a
medical

02:13:49.149 --> 02:13:49.159 align:start position:0%
medical
 
02:13:52.669 --> 02:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
technician is anyone who is otherwise
 
02:13:54.830 --> 02:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
unlicensed who works in a particular
 
02:13:57.310 --> 02:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
facility who may come into contact with
 
02:13:57.320 --> 02:13:58.629 align:start position:0%
facility who may come into contact with
controlled

02:13:58.629 --> 02:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
controlled
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
drugs that's not an actual profession so
 
02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
which leads to the um issue that we have
 
02:14:08.510 --> 02:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
and regardless of what the legislature
 
02:14:10.830 --> 02:14:10.840 align:start position:0%
does I think there needs to be a change
 
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a quorum we have
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
not had a quorum in years a quorum in um
 
02:14:18.750 --> 02:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
of a board we don't have a board because
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
nobody identifies as a medical
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
technician because it's just somebody
 
02:14:23.870 --> 02:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
who happens to work in a facility who's
 
02:14:25.709 --> 02:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
unlicensed who may come into contact
 
02:14:27.549 --> 02:14:27.559 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not an actual
 
02:14:29.470 --> 02:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
profession you know it doesn't describe
 
02:14:31.470 --> 02:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
the activity that they do so we have a
 
02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
hard time recruiting people so the
 
02:14:36.669 --> 02:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
registration is very simple do you meet
 
02:14:38.910 --> 02:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
that criteria you get on the list but
 
02:14:40.350 --> 02:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the registration
 
02:14:42.790 --> 02:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
presumably is to protect the public and
 
02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
so that you're removing people or
 
02:14:46.430 --> 02:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
disciplining people who do things that
 
02:14:48.549 --> 02:14:48.559 align:start position:0%
are not ideal
 
02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
um or considered misconduct because we
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
don't have a quorum of the board we are
 
02:14:55.669 --> 02:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
not able to do the latter half so I have
 
02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
about 11 complaints some of which I
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
would consider to be emergencies that we
 
02:15:01.229 --> 02:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
have not been able to do anything with
 
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a board so
 
02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
regardless of what you do with the
 
02:15:06.589 --> 02:15:06.599 align:start position:0%
registration if you keep it something
 
02:15:09.669 --> 02:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
needs to change because it's essentially
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional at this point so um I mean
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
if you get a complaint you consider
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
serious I mean could you just send it to
 
02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement or something some if
 
02:15:22.109 --> 02:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
there's a criminal component yeah sure
 
02:15:24.109 --> 02:15:24.119 align:start position:0%
but the person or something yeah which
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
is a very common complaint
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
um yes absolutely but of course the
 
02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
standard is different it's beyond A
 
02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt as opposed to Pro you
 
02:15:35.709 --> 02:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
know to um preponderance of the evidence
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
and secondly they're still on the
 
02:15:40.270 --> 02:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
registration and there's nothing to lead
 
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
the public or
 
02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
employers um to to notify them that
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's an issue with respect to
 
02:15:50.870 --> 02:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
Diversion representative M yeah so they
 
02:15:55.549 --> 02:15:55.559 align:start position:0%
are their own board medical correct reg
 
02:15:57.910 --> 02:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
what what is the board called um the
 
02:15:59.189 --> 02:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
board of registration and medical
 
02:16:01.030 --> 02:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
technicians I believe is that board of
 
02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
registration of medical technicians so
 
02:16:05.549 --> 02:16:05.559 align:start position:0%
it's all that radiology
 
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
technician all everything it's just the
 
02:16:12.189 --> 02:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
T yeah just
 
02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
people yeah actually I was going to ask
 
02:16:16.189 --> 02:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
that question so my younger son at one
 
02:16:18.510 --> 02:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
time worked cleaning in a hospital
 
02:16:20.430 --> 02:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
operating rooms in the emergency room
 
02:16:22.109 --> 02:16:22.119 align:start position:0%
did he have access to control drugs
 
02:16:24.709 --> 02:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
maybe he might have in the ER probably
 
02:16:26.589 --> 02:16:26.599 align:start position:0%
then he might have been required to
 
02:16:28.830 --> 02:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
register as a medical technician but not
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
here but yeah yes but he wouldn't go
 
02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
around saying I'm a medical technician
 
02:16:35.150 --> 02:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
that's not something that people there's
 
02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
not that professional identity which is
 
02:16:38.589 --> 02:16:38.599 align:start position:0%
why we have a hard time recruiting no he
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
called himself a fancy janitor there you
 
02:16:42.669 --> 02:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
go maybe we should recruit for it I
 
02:16:42.679 --> 02:16:43.509 align:start position:0%
go maybe we should recruit for it I
don't

02:16:43.509 --> 02:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:16:46.910 --> 02:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
know um but okay so that I wanted to get
 
02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
some idea of what so there is no board
 
02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
they're not under any other board like
 
02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
the nursing lnas are under nursing uh
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing no there is a board in
 
02:16:59.709 --> 02:16:59.719 align:start position:0%
statute there are no actual people to
 
02:17:01.509 --> 02:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
comprise the board I think maybe we have
 
02:17:04.270 --> 02:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
one person and so if you keep the
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
registration and it's a pure
 
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
registration I would suggest eliminating
 
02:17:11.070 --> 02:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
the board and allowing the office to
 
02:17:13.309 --> 02:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
handle these types of claims which is
 
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
very similar to what we do with
 
02:17:17.349 --> 02:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
Opticians which doesn't have a board if
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
you keep the registration I mean that's
 
02:17:20.750 --> 02:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
obviously a policy decision for the
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
legislature that we're not going to
 
02:17:24.509 --> 02:17:24.519 align:start position:0%
weigh in on but I just would use I'm
 
02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
using this as an opportunity explain
 
02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem here and I don't
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
think it's um doing what it needs to be
 
02:17:32.429 --> 02:17:32.439 align:start position:0%
doing um so we need to make some we need
 
02:17:35.150 --> 02:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
to make some changes regardless okay Mr
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
chair certainly a followup so oplc has a
 
02:17:41.790 --> 02:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
board disciplinary board for those that
 
02:17:47.110 --> 02:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
you uh provide licensing or some kind of
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
oversight site so the way it works for
 
02:17:54.389 --> 02:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
most bodies is that um the office we
 
02:17:55.870 --> 02:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
investigate those were the changes that
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
were made last year but ultimately um
 
02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
the allegations have to be brought to an
 
02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory body which is typically a
 
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
board um The Only Exception we have is
 
02:18:13.469 --> 02:18:13.479 align:start position:0%
opic dispensers and in that case it the
 
02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
adjudication is done before the office
 
02:18:18.629 --> 02:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
technically me I've delegated that to a
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
hearings officer so it's just a hearings
 
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
officer so under this scenario there is
 
02:18:27.549 --> 02:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
in statute a board so we are required to
 
02:18:29.709 --> 02:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
bring those cases to the board but
 
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
because there's no board there's it it's
 
02:18:35.469 --> 02:18:35.479 align:start position:0%
a stop stop Gap in the process so I
 
02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
would propose if you're going to keep
 
02:18:39.990 --> 02:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
the registration eliminate the board
 
02:18:42.270 --> 02:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
treat it as a pure registration allow
 
02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
the office or hearings examiner to
 
02:18:45.629 --> 02:18:45.639 align:start position:0%
adjudicate these issues because they
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't require subject matter expertise
 
02:18:49.070 --> 02:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
it's typically somebody diverted drugs
 
02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
or something like that that mean it's
 
02:18:52.910 --> 02:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's there's no expertise required
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
like you you shouldn't steal drugs when
 
02:18:58.389 --> 02:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
you're working in a facility so um so
 
02:19:00.110 --> 02:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
that would be my suggestion if you keep
 
02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:01.669 align:start position:0%
that would be my suggestion if you keep
the

02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:06.270 --> 02:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
registration so Mr chair uh in that case
 
02:19:08.669 --> 02:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is there's already a
 
02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
practice existing corre for another
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
group yes just remove the board which is
 
02:19:17.709 --> 02:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
not in existence it's not functioning so
 
02:19:20.429 --> 02:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
you're not really damaging anything
 
02:19:22.870 --> 02:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
correct and see how it goes if it gets
 
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
too much right and look at it and and I
 
02:19:29.070 --> 02:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
mean I guess and where you've gotten
 
02:19:31.309 --> 02:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
complaints aren't the employers aware of
 
02:19:32.709 --> 02:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
this and maybe doing something or what's
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
going on well we're not well until it's
 
02:19:38.509 --> 02:19:38.519 align:start position:0%
adjudicated we are not allowed to share
 
02:19:40.309 --> 02:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
any information with anybody it's
 
02:19:42.750 --> 02:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
considered confidential so it's
 
02:19:44.349 --> 02:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
extremely frustrating we're holding on
 
02:19:45.790 --> 02:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
to I mean we can share with law
 
02:19:47.870 --> 02:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement which we do but again the
 
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
standards are very different yeah and um
 
02:19:53.469 --> 02:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
even if it's criminal they may not
 
02:19:55.070 --> 02:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
prosecute but if they start
 
02:19:56.670 --> 02:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
investigating the employer I'd hope the
 
02:19:58.389 --> 02:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
employer would get rid of them but I
 
02:19:59.910 --> 02:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
would hope but then they go to the next
 
02:20:03.389 --> 02:20:03.399 align:start position:0%
facility yeah I i' heard from uh you
 
02:20:05.030 --> 02:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
know Senator Sherman about the whole his
 
02:20:06.790 --> 02:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
whole thing is this can we add that
 
02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
language and make
 
02:20:13.590 --> 02:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
bill we can um we don't we'd have to get
 
02:20:17.429 --> 02:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
the language um and so the proposal
 
02:20:21.270 --> 02:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
would be what to do what in I think the
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
I think you need to consider whether you
 
02:20:24.270 --> 02:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
want to eliminate the registration
 
02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
completely if you do keep the bill as is
 
02:20:30.510 --> 02:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
if you don't my proposal would be to
 
02:20:32.630 --> 02:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
modify the bill to only eliminate the
 
02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
board and allow the office to adjudicate
 
02:20:38.510 --> 02:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
the disciplinary actions and we could
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
certainly get you that
 
02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
language that is line two 22 23 24
 
02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
repeal that yeah I remove that that and
 
02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
we can replace it with some other
 
02:20:51.469 --> 02:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
language if that's your desire
 
02:20:55.110 --> 02:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative G and then Brown so um
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
sorry if we REM if we remove this
 
02:21:01.710 --> 02:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
language and we keep
 
02:21:04.750 --> 02:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
it no if we keep this language I'm
 
02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
dyslexic oh I'm having such a hard time
 
02:21:08.950 --> 02:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
with what we're what we're repealing and
 
02:21:13.030 --> 02:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
removing from what but anyway um if we
 
02:21:15.990 --> 02:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
stop registering janitors as medical
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
technicians I plain language I can do
 
02:21:22.510 --> 02:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
that if we if we get a law passed so you
 
02:21:24.469 --> 02:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
don't have to do
 
02:21:27.389 --> 02:21:27.399 align:start position:0%
that then we're really saying that
 
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals and these other places will be
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
monitoring the behavior of their
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
employees on their correct yes thank you
 
02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you last question regarding this
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
the PO we had we had a question pending
 
02:21:41.870 --> 02:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
from representative Brown uh thank you
 
02:21:46.270 --> 02:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um uh director so I don't think
 
02:21:49.150 --> 02:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
in here it removes the requirement to
 
02:21:54.070 --> 02:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
register a medical TCH it does 151 3D is
 
02:21:56.590 --> 02:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
is uh verifying that they're registered
 
02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
not saying they have to register am I am
 
02:22:01.550 --> 02:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
I wrong there well it does but if you
 
02:22:03.550 --> 02:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
look at the line above it says RSA
 
02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
chapter 328i which is the entire
 
02:22:09.150 --> 02:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
registration process is also proposed to
 
02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
be repealed okay 104 thank you and
 
02:22:19.349 --> 02:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
um question yeah so was this the
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
situation at Portmouth
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
Hospital uh exitor Hospital Exit yeah so
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
that was a little bit different that guy
 
02:22:28.590 --> 02:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
that individual was actually a
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
radiologic technician or um which is
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
actually what is regulated under the
 
02:22:38.750 --> 02:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
mirt um the issue there and I will is
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
that I mean having worked on those cases
 
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
registration would not have prevented
 
02:22:46.910 --> 02:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
this that issue because in those cases
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
there was ample evidence um on numerous
 
02:22:52.910 --> 02:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
occasions with the other
 
02:22:55.469 --> 02:22:55.479 align:start position:0%
states um where they failed to report
 
02:22:59.190 --> 02:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
that information and and that's that was
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
the issue in that
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
circumstance um now if they you know the
 
02:23:06.270 --> 02:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
the question remains who would they have
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
reported the information to um at that
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
point our state didn't regulate it so it
 
02:23:14.510 --> 02:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
would have been an independent private
 
02:23:16.030 --> 02:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
certification body that they would have
 
02:23:18.510 --> 02:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
reported it to Andor law
 
02:23:21.590 --> 02:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement um but that was actually a
 
02:23:21.600 --> 02:23:23.670 align:start position:0%
enforcement um but that was actually a
different

02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
profession but it but but that case was
 
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
the Genesis for this statutory change
 
02:23:32.910 --> 02:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
even though this wouldn't have prevented
 
02:23:36.269 --> 02:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a motion which is we we
 
02:23:38.910 --> 02:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
keep in the bill which would mean to
 
02:23:43.429 --> 02:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
repeal from statute uh page six lines 22
 
02:23:49.230 --> 02:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
I think representative G got in there
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
but uh all right all all in
 
02:23:58.830 --> 02:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
favor all opposed okay fine all right
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
and then uh going um before we move on
 
02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
can we clarification certainly did did
 
02:24:07.710 --> 02:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
you keep those lines in or no we kept
 
02:24:10.389 --> 02:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
them in the bill we kept the repeals
 
02:24:12.389 --> 02:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
okay at least that's what the Comm
 
02:24:13.750 --> 02:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will propose the full
 
02:24:15.309 --> 02:24:15.319 align:start position:0%
commission got it thank
 
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
you um
 
02:24:20.030 --> 02:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
02:24:23.269 --> 02:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
then yeah and and
 
02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh oh
 
02:24:27.790 --> 02:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
sir you need to go to the mic if you're
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
G to ask
 
02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
question somebody can give her a
 
02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:33.950 align:start position:0%
question somebody can give her a
space

02:24:33.950 --> 02:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
space
 
02:24:36.190 --> 02:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
quick you planning to keep the
 
02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
registration and eliminate the board no
 
02:24:40.670 --> 02:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
what this is doing was getting rid of
 
02:24:44.349 --> 02:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
the whole thing okay if um you know if
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to either put in a later
 
02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
bill or amend to something
 
02:24:50.309 --> 02:24:50.319 align:start position:0%
separately a a different version of it
 
02:24:52.269 --> 02:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
then that could happen but that's not
 
02:24:57.710 --> 02:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
discussed 10 says it's all repeal all
 
02:25:03.990 --> 02:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
the listed ones are to be repealed so we
 
02:25:07.389 --> 02:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
are repealing the first three 22 23 24
 
02:25:09.710 --> 02:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
and representative Brown yes I I believe
 
02:25:13.710 --> 02:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
the director said if if we repeal the
 
02:25:15.590 --> 02:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
board of registration that that also
 
02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
includes repealing the Reg
 
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
Administration correct because it's in
 
02:25:20.590 --> 02:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
the the entire chapter thank you all
 
02:25:23.309 --> 02:25:23.319 align:start position:0%
right and then I have a a question for
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
oplc about um what so there there are
 
02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
the repeals in here related to Medical
 
02:25:33.510 --> 02:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
Imaging and and radiation therapy yes um
 
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
which one of these all these repeals are
 
02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
related to that so that would be line 20
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh 25 and
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
26 25 is the entire chapter yeah so so
 
02:25:48.190 --> 02:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
as proposed you would just be
 
02:25:50.469 --> 02:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
eliminating The Lure requirement and
 
02:25:53.870 --> 02:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
then 26 is just the reference to a board
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
in our statute 310 which would no longer
 
02:26:00.230 --> 02:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
exist if eliminated by 328j and are the
 
02:26:02.670 --> 02:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
are all of the things in here related to
 
02:26:07.750 --> 02:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
326b all related to lnas or correct um
 
02:26:10.030 --> 02:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
well I would say I think I think it's
 
02:26:13.349 --> 02:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
worth going unfortunately line by line
 
02:26:15.630 --> 02:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
because some of the changes are cleanup
 
02:26:17.910 --> 02:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
changes you know the the ones regarding
 
02:26:20.710 --> 02:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
fees the office has the authority um to
 
02:26:24.510 --> 02:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
assess fees so if if the leg if if the
 
02:26:26.990 --> 02:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
committee wanted to address the cleanup
 
02:26:30.190 --> 02:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
issues still in this bill you would want
 
02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
to go line by line I'll go through it
 
02:26:33.910 --> 02:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
and get you that language by Monday yeah
 
02:26:36.830 --> 02:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:40.510 --> 02:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
um so I I know there was a whole lot of
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
um concern about getting rid of the
 
02:26:45.510 --> 02:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
licensing of Medical Imaging and
 
02:26:48.030 --> 02:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
radiation therapy and I know you may not
 
02:26:51.510 --> 02:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
be able to say or no but what was the
 
02:26:53.630 --> 02:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
impetus behind that why was that viewed
 
02:26:56.269 --> 02:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
as unnecessary if you
 
02:27:00.269 --> 02:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
know so my understanding is that that
 
02:27:02.349 --> 02:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
was created around the time that medical
 
02:27:04.190 --> 02:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
technicians were
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
created and when when looking and again
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not taking a position and there are
 
02:27:12.469 --> 02:27:12.479 align:start position:0%
others I think who can speak to exactly
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
um you know the professional
 
02:27:17.309 --> 02:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
requirements um but
 
02:27:19.469 --> 02:27:19.479 align:start position:0%
they're not not every
 
02:27:19.479 --> 02:27:21.110 align:start position:0%
they're not not every
modality

02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
modality
 
02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
is regulated in every state and the
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
um gist of it you know is a is a belief
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
that regulation or Public Safety can um
 
02:27:39.070 --> 02:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
be ensured through private
 
02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
certification that's the gist okay and
 
02:27:44.429 --> 02:27:44.439 align:start position:0%
is there any current requirement for
 
02:27:46.190 --> 02:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
private certification or would that have
 
02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
to be added if the state wanted a
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
require as oppos the
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
employer um well I don't know that would
 
02:27:56.510 --> 02:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
be interesting I don't know how the
 
02:27:57.990 --> 02:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
state would
 
02:28:00.389 --> 02:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
mandate I think You' probably have to do
 
02:28:03.230 --> 02:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
it through facility regulations to say
 
02:28:04.710 --> 02:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be licensed you have
 
02:28:07.550 --> 02:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
to ensure that somebody in this position
 
02:28:11.190 --> 02:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
has has to be um nationally certified
 
02:28:13.590 --> 02:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
but under the previous model that New
 
02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had which is no regulation it
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
was up to the employer so right now for
 
02:28:23.110 --> 02:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
medical imaging and radiation therapy is
 
02:28:25.550 --> 02:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
that a license or a registration it's a
 
02:28:29.950 --> 02:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
license okay um and what are the
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
requirements like is it basically they
 
02:28:34.550 --> 02:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
have to have this certification some
 
02:28:36.070 --> 02:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized thing is there
 
02:28:38.670 --> 02:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
much more typically they have to have a
 
02:28:40.190 --> 02:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
national certification yes but other
 
02:28:41.349 --> 02:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
than paying the fee and maybe a
 
02:28:43.510 --> 02:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
background check there's the criminal
 
02:28:44.910 --> 02:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
history check is a component as well
 
02:28:46.230 --> 02:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
yeah right but I mean there's is there
 
02:28:47.550 --> 02:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
any other
 
02:28:48.990 --> 02:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
is there a board that comes up with
 
02:28:51.150 --> 02:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
specific criteria and all that for this
 
02:28:52.429 --> 02:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
yeah and I do know we have a member of
 
02:28:54.750 --> 02:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
The Advisory Board in in the audience
 
02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just trying to get the
 
02:28:59.790 --> 02:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
structure yes questions
 
02:29:03.150 --> 02:29:03.160 align:start position:0%
there yeah um before you know we get too
 
02:29:05.230 --> 02:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
much further so I just want to do a
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
little overview of the rest of this um
 
02:29:11.110 --> 02:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
section 10 so we already uh asked uh Mr
 
02:29:14.590 --> 02:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
R house to get us a list of the repeals
 
02:29:17.070 --> 02:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
that are related to the LNA since we're
 
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
not repealing the lnas he said he' get
 
02:29:21.389 --> 02:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
us the ones that we need to remove out
 
02:29:23.630 --> 02:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
of here you said there's some that are
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
from I mean there those the three we
 
02:29:27.630 --> 02:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
dealt with there's the two for the
 
02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
radiation thing there's um some you said
 
02:29:31.870 --> 02:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
are cleanup and you're going to get me a
 
02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
list of which ones are those and we can
 
02:29:38.710 --> 02:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
look at them um and then
 
02:29:43.110 --> 02:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
um are there any other repeals Rel I'd
 
02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
like to get through this first and part
 
02:29:47.550 --> 02:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
of it is um I want to talk about a plan
 
02:29:49.550 --> 02:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
on how to go forward and R Brown needs
 
02:29:50.590 --> 02:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
to leave at
 
02:29:53.190 --> 02:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
3:40 um and doesn't say we have to end
 
02:29:54.590 --> 02:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
then but at least I want to see where we
 
02:29:54.600 --> 02:29:57.630 align:start position:0%
then but at least I want to see where we
can

02:29:57.630 --> 02:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:01.469 --> 02:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
get um so are any of the other repeals
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
related to anything else yeah okay so
 
02:30:07.309 --> 02:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
here here's what i' like to propose to
 
02:30:08.670 --> 02:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee I mean we can the
 
02:30:12.309 --> 02:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
people are here from um the uh radiation
 
02:30:14.110 --> 02:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
therapy and Medical Imaging and we can
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
hear from them um but but and I thank
 
02:30:19.710 --> 02:30:19.720 align:start position:0%
people for that and I apologize it's a
 
02:30:22.830 --> 02:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
big bill with a lot of pieces
 
02:30:26.510 --> 02:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
um my feeling given you know the
 
02:30:28.750 --> 02:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard is
 
02:30:31.510 --> 02:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
that there's probably not an appetite to
 
02:30:35.790 --> 02:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
repeal this and so what I'm thinking
 
02:30:37.190 --> 02:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
where we'll probably go but it's going
 
02:30:40.590 --> 02:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
to be up to the subcommittee is to and
 
02:30:42.790 --> 02:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
we can hear from people first although
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
they may be happy just if we do this but
 
02:30:47.990 --> 02:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
to repeal those two SE ctions Rel you
 
02:30:50.830 --> 02:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
know related to the uh you know lines 25
 
02:30:54.750 --> 02:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
and 26 on page six rep repeal I'm sorry
 
02:30:56.950 --> 02:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
I should say that wrong language problem
 
02:30:58.990 --> 02:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
we will remove them from the Bill thank
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
you and so the we will no longer repeal
 
02:31:02.389 --> 02:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
them and that's what we're talking about
 
02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
doing um yeah and maybe we could make we
 
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
might make a motion but I like to go
 
02:31:10.190 --> 02:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
through the rest of this and then um we
 
02:31:11.990 --> 02:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
need we're going to get from
 
02:31:15.710 --> 02:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
oplc uh two lists one is the repeals
 
02:31:17.830 --> 02:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
that are related to the LNA thing
 
02:31:19.389 --> 02:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
because we're going to add those to
 
02:31:20.870 --> 02:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
things removed from the
 
02:31:23.950 --> 02:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
bill and then there's the other ones
 
02:31:26.590 --> 02:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
that are related to cleanup and so what
 
02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
I would propose is that um you know if
 
02:31:33.190 --> 02:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
they get that to us let's say on Monday
 
02:31:35.990 --> 02:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
that I schedule a 9:00 am subcommittee
 
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
meeting before a regular meeting and all
 
02:31:41.950 --> 02:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
we'll have to do is
 
02:31:45.550 --> 02:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
um you know well I'll look at the time I
 
02:31:46.870 --> 02:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
might be able to get an actual there's
 
02:31:49.469 --> 02:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
two things we need to do one is we need
 
02:31:52.630 --> 02:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
to look over the um the cleanup ones to
 
02:31:54.429 --> 02:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
see if we have an issue with them and
 
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
and vote on that um we can take I think
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
I'm take a vote before uh BR Brown has
 
02:32:01.030 --> 02:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
to leave on the medical imagine um I
 
02:32:02.670 --> 02:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
know when people you can still ask
 
02:32:04.349 --> 02:32:04.359 align:start position:0%
questions of them if you want but I
 
02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
think we heard enough I've got enough
 
02:32:07.950 --> 02:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
documentation that I think that's what
 
02:32:11.870 --> 02:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to do um and then uh we'll
 
02:32:13.910 --> 02:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
meet I'll talk to car about scheduling
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
we'll meet at 9: one morning and and go
 
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
over that and then um and and I'll have
 
02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
the list of things be the things removed
 
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
from the bill around LNA we can vote on
 
02:32:28.269 --> 02:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
that and then I'll have a list of stuff
 
02:32:29.469 --> 02:32:29.479 align:start position:0%
and I and I'll write this out and
 
02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
organize it and that I will then submit
 
02:32:35.830 --> 02:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
to OLS to get a am an amendment and then
 
02:32:37.349 --> 02:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
I'll you know consult with Carol the
 
02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
question is do we need to meet again
 
02:32:40.670 --> 02:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
which would again be a short meeting in
 
02:32:43.550 --> 02:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
the morning um to actually vote to
 
02:32:45.469 --> 02:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
accept this or is it good enough that we
 
02:32:47.469 --> 02:32:47.479 align:start position:0%
voted our
 
02:32:49.910 --> 02:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
intent and then just deal with the real
 
02:32:51.670 --> 02:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment before the full committee is
 
02:32:53.389 --> 02:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
that anybody have an issue with any of
 
02:32:55.990 --> 02:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to suggest we vote the
 
02:32:57.950 --> 02:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
intent with the understanding that we
 
02:33:00.110 --> 02:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
will see the actual written Amendment
 
02:33:02.750 --> 02:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
certainly before it comes up in okay
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
well in that case we would meet as a
 
02:33:06.590 --> 02:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to vote on the amendment
 
02:33:09.469 --> 02:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
which I'm fine with but can't we vote on
 
02:33:11.830 --> 02:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
it and as long as when we look at it
 
02:33:13.550 --> 02:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
before the committee meeting it looks
 
02:33:15.150 --> 02:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
like what
 
02:33:15.160 --> 02:33:16.910 align:start position:0%
like what
wean

02:33:16.910 --> 02:33:16.920 align:start position:0%
wean
 
02:33:18.429 --> 02:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
what when I get it out of os I'm going
 
02:33:20.790 --> 02:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
to send it to everybody yeah and I mean
 
02:33:22.670 --> 02:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
for your help to look at it it's like
 
02:33:24.910 --> 02:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
did I miss something or did OS miss
 
02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
something which I've certainly seen
 
02:33:29.150 --> 02:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
happen so I need your help on that but
 
02:33:30.990 --> 02:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
the question and then certainly if you
 
02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
let me know there's a problem and that's
 
02:33:35.389 --> 02:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
a technical thing something was left out
 
02:33:38.349 --> 02:33:38.359 align:start position:0%
then I can go back to OS um but once we
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
have one that we're happy with then
 
02:33:43.590 --> 02:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
there's a process question which my
 
02:33:44.950 --> 02:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
question is what do we need to do and
 
02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
the other question is what do you folks
 
02:33:48.870 --> 02:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
want want to do um you know we could
 
02:33:50.230 --> 02:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
have then a short subcommittee meeting
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
to formally vote to accept the actual
 
02:33:54.429 --> 02:33:54.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment which I'm okay with or if
 
02:33:56.349 --> 02:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
everybody's okay not doing that and we
 
02:33:58.230 --> 02:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
don't have to then it'll depend on the
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
timing and when we have to execute all I
 
02:34:02.990 --> 02:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
mean that's I'm flexible on all that but
 
02:34:04.870 --> 02:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh I just want to make sure everybody is
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
happy with the end result trying to be
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
clear I'd be happier to vote now on the
 
02:34:10.319 --> 02:34:11.349 align:start position:0%
clear I'd be happier to vote now on the
medical

02:34:11.349 --> 02:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
medical
 
02:34:14.830 --> 02:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
imaging on the whole well we did it in
 
02:34:16.670 --> 02:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
we did it in pieces
 
02:34:18.269 --> 02:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
and so I'd be happy to leave here with
 
02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
an overall vote we don't have to meet
 
02:34:22.590 --> 02:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
again on it
 
02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
as when we get here here's the here's
 
02:34:28.429 --> 02:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
the problem excuse me representative put
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
put your microphone on for
 
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
the here's the problem with that yeah
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
the problem is that there are some of
 
02:34:36.830 --> 02:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
the repeals that are not related to
 
02:34:39.070 --> 02:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
anything we've discussed and voted on
 
02:34:41.830 --> 02:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
but are related to some general opl soid
 
02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
cleanup now sometimes you have things
 
02:34:45.790 --> 02:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
that are called cleanup and they
 
02:34:47.670 --> 02:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
actually have real effects that maybe
 
02:34:50.550 --> 02:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
we'd want to consider and so what I I
 
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be feel Comfort I wouldn't feel
 
02:34:53.710 --> 02:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable okay so i' want us to at
 
02:34:56.630 --> 02:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
least meet um and when we have the list
 
02:34:58.790 --> 02:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
we'll just have a some list hopefully
 
02:35:01.670 --> 02:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
small of these items in section 10 that
 
02:35:04.110 --> 02:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
we need to review and and if we're
 
02:35:06.150 --> 02:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable with all of them fine and
 
02:35:08.590 --> 02:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
then we'll we'll vote to accept them
 
02:35:10.590 --> 02:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
okay um but that's the only part we
 
02:35:12.670 --> 02:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
won't have voted on so I'd like to make
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
a motion right now that um we
 
02:35:21.309 --> 02:35:21.319 align:start position:0%
uh we remove from the bill uh page six
 
02:35:24.750 --> 02:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
lines 25 and 26 which are the ones
 
02:35:28.670 --> 02:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
related to Medical Imaging and radiation
 
02:35:31.389 --> 02:35:31.399 align:start position:0%
therapy and if I can get a actually I'd
 
02:35:33.309 --> 02:35:33.319 align:start position:0%
like to ask someone to make that motion
 
02:35:36.150 --> 02:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
reasons why I'll make that motion okay
 
02:35:38.910 --> 02:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
that means we are not addressing that
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
right now actually um we um and U ba we
 
02:35:46.110 --> 02:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
we are addressing it in the sense where
 
02:35:47.670 --> 02:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
saying we're going to take it out of the
 
02:35:50.429 --> 02:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
bill and therefore we will leave that
 
02:35:52.990 --> 02:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
Licensing in place so yeah we are
 
02:35:57.870 --> 02:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with it and Mr chair M yeah
 
02:36:01.110 --> 02:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
represent I'm just hoping that we can
 
02:36:03.790 --> 02:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
hear from I'll be glad because this is
 
02:36:05.469 --> 02:36:05.479 align:start position:0%
in final and you know we're going to
 
02:36:08.429 --> 02:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
take another vote and so and people came
 
02:36:10.590 --> 02:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
up here yeah but I want to accom I want
 
02:36:12.070 --> 02:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
to get I don't want to have to have
 
02:36:13.830 --> 02:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
another full meeting right and I'd like
 
02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
to accommodate representative Brown I
 
02:36:18.070 --> 02:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
think we I couldn't we couldn't yes all
 
02:36:20.830 --> 02:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
right so any further discussion on this
 
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
motion my question is can we just have
 
02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
them nod their heads if they like this
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
is is there anybody here who is opposed
 
02:36:31.070 --> 02:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
to leaving that Licensing in here yay

02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
fine not the first time I've lost a vote
 
02:37:31.950 --> 02:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the only two uh those are the
 
02:37:34.510 --> 02:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
only two lines I mean as I we've dealt
 
02:37:36.389 --> 02:37:36.399 align:start position:0%
with the three above it on the medical
 
02:37:36.399 --> 02:37:37.990 align:start position:0%
with the three above it on the medical
Technic

02:37:37.990 --> 02:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
Technic
 
02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
registration and we still have to get
 
02:37:43.750 --> 02:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
details on which ones we need to remove
 
02:37:45.750 --> 02:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
from the bill related to because we left
 
02:37:49.230 --> 02:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
s a in licensing and then what are the
 
02:37:51.950 --> 02:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
ones we need to actually look at because
 
02:37:54.670 --> 02:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
they're for cleanup a quick question
 
02:37:57.510 --> 02:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
about to op
 
02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
oplc yeah which is the board under which
 
02:38:02.990 --> 02:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
this Medical Imaging and radiation
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
therapy comes out somebody has a
 
02:38:08.469 --> 02:38:08.479 align:start position:0%
question if you come up
 
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
wait yeah what's sure qu let me I said I
 
02:38:14.469 --> 02:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
want to know if they have a board like
 
02:38:16.150 --> 02:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
the other one they didn't have a board
 
02:38:19.110 --> 02:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
that was functioning okay re uh uh
 
02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
