uh
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
recently we did a uh
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
took an action that we could we
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
that was not legal to take that was the
 
00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.430 align:start position:0%
that was not legal to take that was the
uh

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
the bill that we
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
last built that we decided was going to
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
be an um
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
interim study bill
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
and had an amendment on it so we voted
 
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.710 align:start position:0%
and had an amendment on it so we voted
it

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:19.039 align:start position:0%
interim study as amended
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
i got a conversation with the
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
with the clerk
 
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
it's not legal to do that so what he did
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
is he just stripped off the amendment
 
00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:29.589 align:start position:0%
is he just stripped off the amendment
so

00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
where it goes
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.870 align:start position:0%
representative tripp do you have a
motion

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
i move uh
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna take that back
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
sorry uh
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
this is i move house bill through i mean
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
senate bill 329 ought to pass
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
thank you uh is there a second
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative power seconds
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh would you like to talk to your motion
 
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.550 align:start position:0%
uh would you like to talk to your motion
or

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
but this this uh this bill establishes a
 
00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:37.430 align:start position:0%
but this this uh this bill establishes a
commission

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
to study uh
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
barriers to housing development in in
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire including workforce and
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
middle income housing
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
i think this is something that
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
is warranted because uh we've been going
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
through this uh
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh workforce housing and an affordable
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
housing for several years and uh if they
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
can if the study
 
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.630 align:start position:0%
can if the study
uh

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
if the commission could sh she'll yield
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
some light on what we're doing wrong and
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
not uh uh providing the adequate housing
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
for for the state of new hampshire i
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
think it'd be a great uh
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
step forward thank you so this is a
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
a bill to establish
 
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.630 align:start position:0%
a bill to establish
a

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
to look into these things that
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative piamonte do you have a an
 
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.910 align:start position:0%
representative piamonte do you have a an
amendment

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
um i do
 
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.790 align:start position:0%
um i do
um

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
it is uh amendment two zero two two
 
00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
one eight two eight
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
h chair
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
i have a procedural question yes okay
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
aren't we supposed to adopt the
 
00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
environments first before we pass at otp
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't heard that we haven't heard
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment all the way through yet
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
no no i understand but uh we we had we
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
had a motion for otp
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
so we should we
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
isn't the other way around i i
 
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:13.519 align:start position:0%
understand it can be done either way
 
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
okay so we have a motion to amend
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh the bill
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion on the amendment
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
or a second right second
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative lacellus is the second
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
i'm uh confused because um
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
representative tripp when he made the
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
motion for ought to pass he spoke about
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
the need to study
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
our housing crisis specific as it is to
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
work force housing and yet i look at
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment and it has to do with the
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
municipal budget law so i consider this
 
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
non-germane to the bill
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps representative piemonte can
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
explain why he considers this germain
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
to me it has nothing to do with housing
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'll take that the the
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
the motion is germane because we've
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
already uh discussed this on the house
 
00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:06.949 align:start position:0%
already uh discussed this on the house
floor

00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
and that brings it into the germain
 
00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:10.949 align:start position:0%
and that brings it into the germain
category

00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
category
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
it's this is passed on the house floor
 
00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:14.790 align:start position:0%
it's this is passed on the house floor
yes

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
um then another question i have how
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
would this impact the committee because
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
i also have an amendment that follows
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
our discussion at the public hearing
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's up to you chairman
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
well i hope my amendment can be
 
00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:32.230 align:start position:0%
well i hope my amendment can be
introduced

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
any other discussion yes representative
 
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.910 align:start position:0%
any other discussion yes representative
majipudi

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
majipudi
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the procedure and
 
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
to follow up with my colleague who
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned about the non-domain part of
 
00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.190 align:start position:0%
mentioned about the non-domain part of
it

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
not the study but replaces it with the
 
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
municipal budget
 
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.670 align:start position:0%
municipal budget
so

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.590 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
i'm having a hard time reconciling the
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
fact that this yeah
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
you're having trouble with it being
 
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
germaine uh not so much the jo it yes
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
jermaine and also
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
what uh representative trump
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
talked about the ought to pass is the
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
to study the housing crisis and barriers
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
and this the amendment turns the bill on
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
its head and talks about the municipal
 
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
budget so
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
how does this relate to the underlying
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:44.629 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:13:46.079 --> 00:13:47.590 align:start position:0%
that was
combined

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
combined
 
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.870 align:start position:0%
combined
as

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
that was combined as as one amendment
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
i attached the uh bill which was um
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
i attached
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
1393 to an amendment that
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
this amendment which is 1828h
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
there were some other changes
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.590 align:start position:0%

when i added uh on line eight section

when i added uh on line eight section
four

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%

i added after middle income housing i
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
had manufacturing housing
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
and 3d printed houses i don't know if
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
anybody's familiar with those
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
but they're
 
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.150 align:start position:0%
but they're
a

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
we're looking for ways to to
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
create housing in new hampshire okay
 
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.910 align:start position:0%
create housing in new hampshire okay
and

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
these two were not included in the
 
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.269 align:start position:0%
these two were not included in the
original

00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh bill
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
or the
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
bills pertaining to these uh the subject
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
of housing beforehand
 
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.550 align:start position:0%
of housing beforehand
and

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.350 align:start position:0%
and
it's

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
it makes housing very affordable um
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
and you can go on to youtube if you want
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
to look it up it tells exactly how the
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
3d housing works
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
um and the manufactured housing wasn't
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned on there because they built
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
these in the
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the uh
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
factory or whatever it is and they'll
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
come to the
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
site where they're going to put them
 
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
together they put them together and the
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
houses go up and they're very affordable
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
so i thought that was important
 
00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:39.910 align:start position:0%
so i thought that was important
also

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative davis
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:15:48.389 --> 00:15:48.399 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm just dumb
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
or it's early but it looks to me as
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
though this amendment replaces the bill
 
00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:57.670 align:start position:0%
though this amendment replaces the bill
no

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
the language says replacing it with you
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
because i was very specific with ols
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.509 align:start position:0%
with this
um

00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
the actually the bill 1393
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's like the you know we get bills from
 
00:16:21.509 --> 00:16:21.519 align:start position:0%
the senate sometimes with
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
things added on
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
and this particular one
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
was put on
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to give it a little extra
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
handling the bill so where is the bill
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
that it's that it's amending it appears
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
that it is replacing the bill no because
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
will be added to 329
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
when we if when we bring up the other
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
past motion
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
i guess i wish
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
it said that
 
00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
because it's not clear to me that that's
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
the case
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
from this amendment will we just is it
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
i believe if you go to line 11 of the
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
amendment you'll see that it says to
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
mend the bill by replacing all after
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
section 2.
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
674 colon 61a
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
after section two it just effectively
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
replaces section three
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative manager foodie
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
following up with my colleague on the
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
other side
 
00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:43.909 align:start position:0%
other side
um

00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative stavis
 
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
if i'm looking at the underlying bill
 
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.150 align:start position:0%
if i'm looking at the underlying bill
and

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
the second section
 
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
is the core of the bill the members of
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
the commission shall
 
00:17:58.830 --> 00:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
be as follows and this amendment
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
replaces that
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
and so there's no commission
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
if the underlying bill
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
is replaced so
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
basically then the bill becomes the
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
municipal budget law bill
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
so i am still not able to understand
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
other than just a commission established
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
and next
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
second section is members of the
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
commission and that's it being replaced
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
by municipal budget law so
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
how is this the same bill in it
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
addressing the housing
 
00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:40.870 align:start position:0%
addressing the housing
that's

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.669 align:start position:0%
that's
the

00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
question that has not been answered
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
right uh representative power
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair it appears to me that
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment 1828 does two things the
 
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
first thing that it does is it um
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
goes into section one of the underlying
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
bill and under roman numeral four it
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
replaces that section with the um
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
it replaces the entirety of roman
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
numeral for under section one
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
and it keeps what is in the underlying
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
bill and it's simply adding the um
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
studying middle income housing
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing in the 3d so that's
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
the first thing it does and then the
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
second thing that this amendment does is
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
after section two which is on page two
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's adding a section three
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
so um line six of the amendment may
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
appear to be worded um
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
not clearly but i believe that my
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
explanation should clarify what this
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
amendment does
 
00:19:53.029 --> 00:19:53.039 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion yes
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned
 
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
so by creating this christmas by
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
creating this christmas tree bill since
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
we'll have housing and a tax cap which
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
we which
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
i am going to oppose
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
um what we have done is we have
 
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.390 align:start position:0%
um what we have done is we have
eliminated

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
the people i i appreciate
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the explanation and and
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
don't accept it
 
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
um what we have done is we have
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
eliminated the clarity for who is going
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
to be on the commission to study
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
barriers to housing
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
um that's the way i read this bill as we
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
try to fit it in there and if we had a
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
public hearing on this which we haven't
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
on this section in this bill we might
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
have been able to understand it a little
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
bit better but we're trying to digest
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
this right now so i will be recommending
 
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.510 align:start position:0%
this right now so i will be recommending
that

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
that we vote no on this amendment and no
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
and i have to say i'm i'm very
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
disappointed because at the public
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
hearing uh senator perkins cuoco brought
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
forth some changes that she wanted to
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
the bill she wanted to add somebody from
 
00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.190 align:start position:0%
the bill she wanted to add somebody from
the

00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh office of planning and development
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
and then we during the our discussion
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
we brought up the fact that it would be
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
important that the representative from
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
the house was a member of this committee
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
because we are more well-versed in
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
issues regarding housing and then also
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
that we would
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
add somebody from a local planning board
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
because most of the impediments to
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
workforce housing are decisions that are
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
made at that local level
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
and those to me are very important
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
components to add to this commission to
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
really address the problem that's that
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is trying to address
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
with this amendment it takes all of that
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
away and i think it's a slap in the face
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
to everybody that came to the public
 
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
hearing that has a sincere interest in
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
addressing public housing workforce
 
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.549 align:start position:0%
addressing public housing workforce
housing

00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
just kind of
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
trashing the bill to get in this
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
municipal budget law
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
to me is is very disingenuous and i
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
think it undermines the integrity that
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
this committee should exhibit thank you
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
yes representatives davis
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
representative piemonte mentioned
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing and
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
3d 3d housing
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
can you point out to me where that is in
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
your amendment yes
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.830 align:start position:0%
your amendment yes
on

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%

00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
and follow up mr chair but and thank you
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
i missed that
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
um and and i actually agree with that i
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
think that's a good idea
 
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.029 align:start position:0%
think that's a good idea
but

00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'm still puzzled and maybe i'm just
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
being really dense this morning
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
the commission is still in effect
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
that's why to me that was very important
 
00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:10.230 align:start position:0%
that's why to me that was very important
because

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
those two items
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
were not brought up before
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
in any of the housing bills
 
00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:17.830 align:start position:0%
in any of the housing bills
okay

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
and um i thought that i felt that that
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
an important issue to
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
bring up because you know
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
we're talking about housing that's
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh now the big thing is people can't get
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
housing it's too pricey not affordable
 
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.549 align:start position:0%
housing it's too pricey not affordable
there's

00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
that and there's some other ways that
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know can
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
have affordable housing for
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
um i i'll give you an example here in
 
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
sandow we have a uh
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
over 55 housing and
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
the houses that they put up was very
 
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.149 align:start position:0%
the houses that they put up was very
minimal

00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
minimal
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
they had a slab they had a two i think
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
it was a two bedroom one car garage or a
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
two-car garage
 
00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:03.919 align:start position:0%
and they were put together
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
in a a very nice way
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
that people felt comfortable
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
um that was another issue of topic that
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
was not
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
brought up during
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
any other the commissions before that so
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
that type of housing that's called
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in my chart in my
 
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.230 align:start position:0%
affordable housing in my chart in my
estimation

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
estimation
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
it also has a uh
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
a ring where
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
builders or developers could put these
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
houses up
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
along with the 3d and the manufactured
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
housing for reasonable costs i mean very
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable costs and
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh i i was talking with one of the
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
building inspectors that
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
has a uh
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
knowledge of this
 
00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:49.510 align:start position:0%
knowledge of this
and

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
from what they can gather you know
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
you're talking maybe 200 000 or
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
something like that and you get a house
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
with a land on it that type with that
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
type of thing if you use 3d
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
housing it's it'll be less expensive
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
than that
 
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.590 align:start position:0%
than that
so

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's something that they need to look
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
into i think that's why i did that
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative davis
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm gilman i'm sorry
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh just to clarify i
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
think uh
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative power did go through this
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
um the amendment which we just saw today
 
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.350 align:start position:0%
um the amendment which we just saw today
um

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
really be begins on what was the
 
00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
original bill uh number two at line one
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
number two
 
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh changes adds all of the information
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
about the budget caps
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
effective date
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
i have to say that i am disappointed
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
that these two items have gone these two
 
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
subjects have gone together
 
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.470 align:start position:0%
subjects have gone together
um

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
it was unexpected and
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
um i will be voting against the
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
amendment and then against the motion to
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
approve it
 
00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.149 align:start position:0%
approve it
representative

00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
two things one of which is the
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
commission is still there i think the
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
confusion is happening because um
 
00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
line eight and nine of representative
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
pia monty's amendment
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
lines eight and nine replace
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh or make a change to line 22 and 23
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
so all of this upper section con you
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
know containing all the information
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
about who's going to serve on the
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
commission is all still there however
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
i would agree that i'm extremely unhappy
 
00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
with this edition of the tax cap uh
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
language to this bill i don't think it's
 
00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.390 align:start position:0%
language to this bill i don't think it's
germaine

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
germaine
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
i think it's a bad plan to glom it onto
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
here i think we all are in agreement
 
00:26:43.919 --> 00:26:45.430 align:start position:0%
here i think we all are in agreement
um

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
about the necessity to do something with
 
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.470 align:start position:0%
about the necessity to do something with
housing

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.430 align:start position:0%
housing
and

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
i just i'm really unhappy that we have
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
glommed these two things together and no
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
i cannot vote for this amendment
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
one further
 
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
so um one further question about the
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh german-ness
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
um of the amendment in question um
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
the determination
 
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.070 align:start position:0%
the determination
um

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
the the determination you
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
stated um
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
as to why this bill
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
or why this amendment
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
counts as germain is that um
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
is that something that uh the speaker
 
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
and the clerk um could confirm for us
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
question about whether a
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
bill is germaine is
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
that eventually goes to the speaker and
 
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
the clerk if it hasn't already in this
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
particular case the way it was explained
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
to me because i had the same question
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh as i previewed what we were going to
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
document standpoint and i asked the same
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
question and and the answer is
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
that since
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
this was discussed
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
in uh in this session recently that it
 
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes i have a question
 
00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.230 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes i have a question
this

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
bill has not come to the house floor it
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
was discussed at the summit so this is
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
the senate bill
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
that has come to the house so it was not
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
discussed it hasn't gone to the house
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
floor so i'm kind of confused with your
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
statement about
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.919 --> 00:28:49.110 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding is thank you
 
00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:53.320 align:start position:0%
representative majipudi that house bill
 
00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.870 align:start position:0%
representative majipudi that house bill
1393

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
1393
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
is where this was originally discussed
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
as it went when it was a house bill
 
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
and the the senate bill that we have in
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
front of us is uh
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um with regard to
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
section three of the amendment
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
the the language in section three did
 
00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
come before this committee and there was
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
a hearing passed out of committee ought
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
to pass went to the house floor and
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
passed the house
 
00:29:36.399 --> 00:29:37.350 align:start position:0%
passed the house
so

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
therefore my understanding is
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
due to those two provisions that this is
 
00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.230 align:start position:0%
due to those two provisions that this is
germaine

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
germaine
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gallagher
 
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.990 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gallagher
so

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
it seems to me if this amendment was
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
discussed as an amendment to house bill
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
1393 previously
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
this would make it
 
00:29:58.399 --> 00:29:59.590 align:start position:0%
this would make it
germane

00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
germane
 
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.630 align:start position:0%
germane
to

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 1393 if we were discussing
 
00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
that again
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
but were
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
um we're discussing senate bill 329
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
instead and as far as i'm sorry as far
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
as i'm i can see in the bill in senate
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
bill 329 it doesn't say
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere in it this is
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
a child of
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh last session's house bill 1393 so i'm
 
00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.029 align:start position:0%
uh last session's house bill 1393 so i'm
sorry

00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't see how you can um
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
how you can connect the two of those
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
when it doesn't explicitly say so itself
 
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative piemonte has a correction
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry i quoted the wrong bill
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.990 align:start position:0%
it's uh
1194.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
1194.
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher thank you for
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
your comment uh i can only think i can
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
tell you is that it was unsure to me
 
00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.149 align:start position:0%
tell you is that it was unsure to me
also

00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:31:02.789 --> 00:31:02.799 align:start position:0%
uh and it was it was confirmed by her by
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
the leadership and by the by the clerk
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
that it was indeed germaine
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative wrong
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
so if it if it passed this committee and
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
if it passed the house
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
why are we adding it on to a senate
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
i just felt it was something else that
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
had to be looked at and i put it on that
 
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.909 align:start position:0%
had to be looked at and i put it on that
bill

00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:31:29.919 --> 00:31:30.789 align:start position:0%
bill
so

00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative matt jory
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you mr chair so
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
when you have a multi-year expenditure
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
can somebody please explain how the
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
community reconciles the first only
 
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
being able to use the first year payment
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
of the bond which is typically principal
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
and not principal and interest and how
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
they reconcile future budgets
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
after that
 
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
when you have to then include the full
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
up all-in
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
of the multi-year payment on the bond
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
can you please explain that
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh only thing i can tell you is that
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
this was reviewed whether or not it
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
needed to go to the finance committee
 
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
because of those questions like that and
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
the answer was no
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
so i know that doesn't answer your
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
question but that's those are the
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which we find ourselves
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead so thank you i appreciate
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
that the question wasn't so much on
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
on whether or not this should be a
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
second a second committee bill but how a
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
community has to reconcile that under
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
uh roman 3 sub a for warrant articles
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
proposing bonds notes or all the
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
multi-year expenditures only the first
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
year estimated cost
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
shall be used in counting appropriations
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
for the tax cap under paragraphs 1
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
a so i'm just concerned as a member of
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
the select board
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
and a former representative to the
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
budget committee how you reconcile those
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
different appropriations that have to go
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
into the budgeting
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
and if somebody had an answer to that
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't have a a detailed
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
answer for you all i can say is that if
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed it carries that
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
language with it whether it's confusing
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
or not so it might depend on how you
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
want to vote on the bill
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
on the on the amendment rather yes
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
representative matchupooli thank you mr
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for uh
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's a total
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
confusion in my mind at this time one on
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
one level
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
having served on a school
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
school board in a city
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
and you know the budget
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
how you reconcile the first to the
 
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
second zero by the base budget kind of
 
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.230 align:start position:0%
second zero by the base budget kind of
thing

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
it muddies the water
 
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
for all
 
00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.310 align:start position:0%
for all
municipalities

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.509 align:start position:0%
municipalities
so

00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
instead of giving the
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
a little more clarity in how to deal
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:15.909 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
i mean i have a very hard time
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
understanding it myself so
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
be able to support this because
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
the bill underlying bill was very
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
focused study
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
on the housing issue
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
this muddies the water
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chin thank you
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
representative piante
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair um and thank you
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.710 align:start position:0%
for the question
um

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
we've all experienced these bills that i
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
mean we've got them from the senate
 
00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:49.510 align:start position:0%
mean we've got them from the senate
they're

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
they're omnibus
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative man jerry's mentioned
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
christmas tree bill but
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
anything like this as long as it's your
 
00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.430 align:start position:0%
anything like this as long as it's your
main

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
main
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
and i did that because i wanted to have
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
another take have to take another look
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
at it
 
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.109 align:start position:0%
at it
plus

00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
plus
 
00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:09.990 align:start position:0%
plus
uh

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
in in the additions i made to the
 
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.990 align:start position:0%
in in the additions i made to the
commission

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
i thought it would be an effective way
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
so we've all we've all come across these
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
things before and this is nothing new
 
00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:23.670 align:start position:0%
things before and this is nothing new
um

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's just uh i've decided to do it here
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you my understanding if i may is
 
00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.990 align:start position:0%
thank you my understanding if i may is
that

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
in in the uh
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
execution of the town
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
annual meeting
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
or smaller towns
 
00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh or sp sp2 for larger towns
 
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.349 align:start position:0%
uh or sp sp2 for larger towns
uh

00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:49.359 --> 00:35:50.870 align:start position:0%
uh
that

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
is there is a feeling among several
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
legislators that not enough attention is
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
being paid to the gov the government
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
expenditures at that local level
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
and one of the things my understanding
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
is that this bill is trying to do is to
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
drive attention
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh more attention to examining is
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're voting for at the
 
00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:12.079 align:start position:0%
local level and to consider that as a
 
00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:16.069 align:start position:0%
local level and to consider that as a
representative

00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and um truthfully
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
i wasn't going to speak because
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
um it it feels like this is a done deal
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
and and um i i
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
it felt like it would be futile but i i
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
have to say
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
that um the original bill the underlying
 
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.750 align:start position:0%
that um the original bill the underlying
bill

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
um i i think
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
is a giant step forward and
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative pimantes lines eight
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
through nine changing section four i
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
think is brilliant and and um i
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
appreciated him putting that forward
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
like many of my colleagues here and i'm
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
just kind of doing a me too here and i
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
don't mean it to be that way
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
but my concern of adding this takes a
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
bill that i could have
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
voted for and i thought would do a
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
really good thing to put on something
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
that's already passed both
 
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
1194 and 1393 which deal with the school
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
budget and the and so on um and when i
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
look at the um 1194 that did pass the
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
house 183 to 146 it's basically verbatim
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
while i do appreciate
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
what representative piemonte said it's
 
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
always good to take another look at it
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that we are doing the
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
right things this bill is already this
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
particular bill has already passed i
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
think perhaps maybe next year
 
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
it would be good to put a commission
 
00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
that was very specific to this rather
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
than trying to attach this i don't
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
personally have problems with omnibus
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
bills if they're if they're good or
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
christmas tree bills whatever anybody
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
wants to call them so i'm not i'm not
 
00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
complaining on that the tag along type
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
of thing the issue i have is that we
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
have a good bill which is very helpful
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
to the housing market i think adding
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
this is going to take away um some of
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
the votes personally i voted against the
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
um 1194 on the house floor
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
so for me to
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
accept this within this bill that
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
something that's already passed
 
00:38:13.119 --> 00:38:13.990 align:start position:0%
something that's already passed
um

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
i don't i i never look at anybody's
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
motive for doing anything and please
 
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
don't think that i'm doing that
 
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm not even gonna ask the why i'm
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
just gonna make the comment of that i
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
think it's unnecessary on a good bill to
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
add something like this that creates
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
controversy and i'll leave it at that so
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for hearing me let
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
me also add that
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
i didn't know that much about
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
3d printing
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
at the construction level and for those
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
of you who are
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
not familiar with it i would encourage
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
you to
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
to go online and look at
 
00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.430 align:start position:0%
to go online and look at
either

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
some of the commercial
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
uh applications out there that allow you
 
00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
to ser to use a search engine to find
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
out about three 3d printing that that's
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
actually houses being printed in
 
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.390 align:start position:0%
actually houses being printed in
concrete

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
concrete
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
by a 3d machine and it's it's really
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
fascinating and
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
one of our thoughts
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
this may be a way
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
housing

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
in a less expensive way
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh and that
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
we also understand this will probably
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
take some special uh consideration by
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
local planning boards and and so forth
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
as this will be very different
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh so uh
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
i was very encouraged when i read it i
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
said where did this 3d printing come
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
from and and uh we researched it and
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's very uh
 
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
interesting and i think it could it
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
could put a dent in our in our
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
00:39:53.119 --> 00:39:55.349 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
yes

00:39:55.349 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
i'm actually representative vann i'm
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
sorry that's okay still representative
 
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
van uh
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
this whole three i mean fine put 3d
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
printing on here but i just want to
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
assure people 3d printing is not going
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
to save anything when you when you look
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
at how fast a team of three block masons
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
can lay and it prints uh it prints a
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
concrete shell is what it does it prints
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
a concrete shell you still have to
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
wire it plum it finish the inside put a
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
roof on it
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
insulate from the inside
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
in and it a team of two block masons can
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
build that same shell in four days
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
it's i you know
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
i'm happy for people to look into 3d
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
printing but i just want to say that
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
my understanding and this is what i do
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
day in and day out
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
is that 3d printing of housing is not
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
going to save any of us
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
anyway and i still can't vote for this
 
00:40:51.119 --> 00:40:54.069 align:start position:0%
anyway and i still can't vote for this
bill

00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative gallagher
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
um so yeah i think
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
3d printing is interesting and possibly
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
worth studying but the thing is
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
the amendment doesn't just do that part
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
it also has the tax cap part so
 
00:41:16.309 --> 00:41:16.319 align:start position:0%
um or what i'm wondering
 
00:41:16.319 --> 00:41:17.670 align:start position:0%
um or what i'm wondering
um

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps since the clerk is here now he
 
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
can't answer this but um
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
so um under robert's rules there's um a
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
thing called a motion to divide the
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
question i'm wondering if the same thing
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
exists under mason's manual or you got
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
the right guy in the room right now to
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
answer that question but we'll let him
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
all right um yeah we can
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
continue or um
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh let representative manju puti has her
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
hands up so she can ask something while
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
we're waiting
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you uh
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher for yielding to
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
me um this question is for the
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative who has brought in
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative piermante maybe you can
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
explain and i see your intention of
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
expanding the scope of the commission
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
which is the right thing to add more
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
options for housing which is fine
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
but we already have this bill that
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
passed the house
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
for municipal budget law
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
would you reconsider
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:43.839 align:start position:0%
good bill don't throw the baby with the
 
00:42:43.839 --> 00:42:44.790 align:start position:0%
good bill don't throw the baby with the
uh

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
work so would you reconsider
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
taking this which is already past the
 
00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:51.109 align:start position:0%
taking this which is already past the
house

00:42:51.109 --> 00:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
your part of your amendment or divide it
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
um the reason i put it in there was to
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
give it another
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
a look at another opportunity
 
00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:03.430 align:start position:0%
a look at another opportunity
um

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
you know and and i let let it uh go with
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
the bill i'm keeping it the way it is
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
um i guess i'm here so um
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
mr maturi
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
they were all before me thank thank you
 
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:17.910 align:start position:0%
they were all before me thank thank you
but

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
mr samps
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to go on the record to say
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
that i'm not in favor of 3d printing
 
00:43:25.359 --> 00:43:30.550 align:start position:0%
that i'm not in favor of 3d printing
babies

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.190 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
i i'd just like thank you uh mr chair
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to point out that um we
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
had a bill in here
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
about taking a second bite of the apple
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
having multiple people on multiple
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
boards who get a second bite of the
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
apple so i i object to this bill on the
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
grounds that people don't like having a
 
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
second bite of the apple and i just
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise that point thank you
 
00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:58.470 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise that point thank you
okay

00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i know with that
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
we've talked about house bill 1194 which
 
00:44:06.309 --> 00:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
passed at the on the house floor but
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
this bill has already had a hearing in
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
the senate and we have not had any
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
public hearing on this uh amendment to
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
the senate bill
 
00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:17.109 align:start position:0%
the senate bill
uh

00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry house bill 1194 had uh is
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
still on the senate floor
 
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.309 align:start position:0%
still on the senate floor
so

00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative status
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
so as not to keep anyone in the dark i
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
did contact the clerk
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
to ask him about the non-germaness or
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
not of this amendment
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh it was stated here earlier by the
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
chair that the clerk had seen and
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
approved the amendment in fact the clerk
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
had never seen this amendment
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
and so he is now speaking with the chair
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to be on record as saying
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
that was not true what was said earlier
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
maybe he misspoke on that but
 
00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
that was not that was not true
 
00:45:12.069 --> 00:45:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:22.790 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me for a minute i'm going to uh
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
confer with the
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.839 --> 00:46:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry about the delay uh
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
we got into a lengthy discussion with
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
collector of the court about germain
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
versus non-germaine it's a rather
 
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.109 align:start position:0%
versus non-germaine it's a rather
complex

00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
complex
 
00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.150 align:start position:0%
complex
subject

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
subject
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
but uh i believe we're we're okay now
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
where we are with the with the bill
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh was there a
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher do you have do
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
you have an unanswered question you
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to continue
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
yeah or i was wondering if i could asked
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
well i spoke to the clerk and
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
the rules we have for the house
 
00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
supersede uh mason's rule so if that's
 
00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:57.750 align:start position:0%
supersede uh mason's rule so if that's
your

00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
your question which one takes precedence
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's the house rule
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
okay so um is there such a thing as a
 
00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
motion to divide the question or not
 
00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.710 align:start position:0%
motion to divide the question or not
then

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
divide the question
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
well we're we're not entertaining any
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
more motions right now we're looking at
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment to the bill
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
so that that's what's that's what's
 
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
before us we can't add another motion
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
to what's before us
 
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.430 align:start position:0%
to what's before us
yeah

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:29.190 align:start position:0%
yeah
yes

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
as i recall representative tripp made a
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
motion ought to pass on the bill
 
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
and then we had a motion to pass the
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
amendment are we now considering two
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
motions at the same time
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to take up the motion the
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
amendment first
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
but and then we'll come back to the to
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
the other motion to see if we want to do
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
that as amended
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
and that and that's perfectly fine to do
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
it that way only because the clerk is
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
here it's perfectly fine to have two
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
motions on the table at the same time
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
without disposing of the first amendment
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
which was ought to pass on the bill
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
without amendment
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
can i get clarity on that uh may i get
 
00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.390 align:start position:0%
can i get clarity on that uh may i get
clarion

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
clarion
 
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh i'm gonna say that uh
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's done both ways with the
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
amendments brought in first
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
or the amendment's brought in second
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh but they're essentially together
 
00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:22.630 align:start position:0%
uh but they're essentially together
and

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's where we are we have a we have a
 
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.549 align:start position:0%
that's where we are we have a we have a
motion

00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
to okay to proceed and a
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh additional motion to pass an
 
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:39.030 align:start position:0%
uh additional motion to pass an
amendment

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
so perhaps representative tripp may have
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
misspoke but my understanding is that
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with the ought to pass
 
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
motion on the amendment
 
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
if there if if there's if there's some
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
confusion then perhaps representative
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
tripp needs to withdraw
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
his original motion on the bill ought to
 
00:49:00.319 --> 00:49:01.589 align:start position:0%
his original motion on the bill ought to
pass

00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
i call the question
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
on the ought to pass motion on house on
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to take a vote
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
right now on
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
you can't you have to do this i'm sorry
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
on the base bill and then we'll take up
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
the amendment afterwards
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
no we're going to i guess we're going to
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
sure please
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman just to just to be clear uh
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
you have to have a positive motion for
 
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
an amendment to be considered typically
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
the motion is
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
representative trip moves ought to pass
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
and offers amendments such and such that
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
is the correct motion that is the
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
correct way to state uh the proposition
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
before you just to be clear we do not
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
move questions in committee uh there is
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
no motion to limit debate uh the the
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the committee is to
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
dispose of everything specifically to
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher's question
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
about dividing uh the whole purpose of
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
executive session is to consider
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
amendments as well so if you decided
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
that you liked a portion of the
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
amendment but not another part you would
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
have a new amendment redrafted
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr clerk thank you
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
so uh representative tripp
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
would you like to withdraw your motion
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
and and make it again make a new motion
 
00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.150 align:start position:0%
and and make it again make a new motion

uh
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
more closely aligned with uh with the
 
00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
clerk's recommendation
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%

isn't this the time that in if there is
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
any other amendment
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
is it not the time to also bring
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
whether we put this down up or down and
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
then the other amendments or is it
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
free speech thank you that's a good
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
question the
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
the way we're going to execute this is
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's on the floor right
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
now is that is the controlling document
 
00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
if we in discussion
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
on this in this executive committee we
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
can talk about
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
that hey wait a minute i have an
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
amendment i want to offer too and it
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
does this and does that
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
will allow the committee to consider
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
that input
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
but right now you can't make another
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
motion so we have multiple motions
 
00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:25.910 align:start position:0%
motion so we have multiple motions
uh

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
from multiple amendments at the same
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
time we'd have to defeat the first
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
amendment and then offer another
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
amendment if if that's the direction of
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
the committee yes representative power
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i have a procedural
 
00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:39.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i have a procedural
question

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
so um i understand that
 
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
with regards to this this bill we have
 
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:46.790 align:start position:0%
with regards to this this bill we have
two

00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
amendments before us we're dealing with
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative piamonte's amendment
 
00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.270 align:start position:0%
uh representative piamonte's amendment
currently

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
only one
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
the only deal at a time
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
i understand one at a time
 
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.390 align:start position:0%
i understand one at a time
um

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
we can discuss
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
another amendment yeah part of the
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
overall discussion but we can't make a
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
motion i understand that so
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative rung also has an
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
amendment and my question is
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
are amendments stackable
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.990 align:start position:0%
no thank you
president

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
president
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
yes i'm going to be voting against the
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as with this amendment
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
because we heard discussion at the
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.790 align:start position:0%
public hearing
about

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
refining the members of the commission
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
at our last executive session i brought
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
to you an amendment that reflected that
 
00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.990 align:start position:0%
to you an amendment that reflected that
discussion

00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
specifically having the representative
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
be a member of this committee
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
specifically having a member of a local
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
planning board
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
and also revising the date because in
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
the original bill the date was
 
00:53:54.559 --> 00:53:56.390 align:start position:0%
the original bill the date was
unrealistic

00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
unrealistic
 
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.750 align:start position:0%
unrealistic
um

00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
since that and representative piamonte
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
was aware of that he has that first
 
00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.670 align:start position:0%
was aware of that he has that first
amendment

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:54:06.470 --> 00:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
since we went into recess of that uh
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:08.870 align:start position:0%
executive session
i

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
um senator uh kwanka's office sent me
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
her amendment that she had presented at
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
the public hearing but we didn't have
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
enough copies and i incorporated her
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
edition of someone from the
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
department of
 
00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.549 align:start position:0%
department of
uh

00:54:26.549 --> 00:54:26.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
the member of the the state planning and
 
00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.990 align:start position:0%
the member of the the state planning and
development

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
development
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
um the drafting attorney
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
with this second amendment adjusted the
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
quorum to increase it by one since we
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
were increasing the commission by one
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
my amendment today reflects public input
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
expert input
 
00:54:52.150 --> 00:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
this committee has had that the bulk of
 
00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:53.030 align:start position:0%
this committee has had that the bulk of
that

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
those changes for a week
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
so now to be an amendment where those
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
improvements are not incorporated new
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
things are added and then we have
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
an attachment that has already been
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
discussed in committee already been
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
voted in committee already passed in the
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
house but we're adding it here so we can
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
look at it a little more to me is very
 
00:55:18.069 --> 00:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
disingenuous and i think it hurts the
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
integrity of this committee and i will
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
be voting no and it's sad because we
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
really need to address workforce housing
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
i have always been proud to be a member
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
of municipal and county government and
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
today i am not proud to be a member of
 
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
i believe that we have violated our own
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
procedural rules i believe we have
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
violated the rules of the house and i
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
believe we are violating the spirit of
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
the bill that has been heard by the
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
public and commented on by the public
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
i understand that technically because
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
the budget cap bill passed the house
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
that makes it germane but no i'm sorry
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
sir it does not make it germane it is
 
00:56:06.799 --> 00:56:08.630 align:start position:0%
sir it does not make it germane it is
non-germane

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
non-germane
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
in the philosophical and moral sense of
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
being non-germane and i would like to
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
know who on this named commission
 
00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
in the underlying bill has expertise in
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
municipal budgeting he's going to take
 
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
another bite at this apple
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
we have a uh
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's appropriate at this time we
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
have representative rungs
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh amendment uh her draft and we have
 
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
the one that
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
is pending uh certainly willing to take
 
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
there is a motion on the floor but uh
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
we can uh
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
as per the
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
the cleric
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
we can discuss
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
potentially other other amendments
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
representing her magic pootie
 
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
yeah representative van had her hands up
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
before me
 
00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:20.549 align:start position:0%
before me
yeah

00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i i think that we i have
 
00:57:26.549 --> 00:57:26.559 align:start position:0%
we are wedged
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
because although we can take up
 
00:57:32.150 --> 00:57:32.160 align:start position:0%
amendments in order in which case we
 
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
would vote on the amendment on the floor
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
right now which adds the tax cap
 
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.870 align:start position:0%
right now which adds the tax cap
language

00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
then we could take up representative
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
rungs amendment but that
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm happy to do that because that
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
takes the tax cap language out but that
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
would be the order in which we would do
 
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.309 align:start position:0%
would be the order in which we would do
it

00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:57:48.319 --> 00:57:49.270 align:start position:0%
it
so

00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
the way i see it is
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
you can either pass the amendment that
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
has the tax cap language which i think

01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
amendment you are now going back on what
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
you just said i said it's the uh
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
motion failed then
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
no that's not what you said
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
that is not what you said
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes can i clarify my question i
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
am absolutely sure in how i asked the
 
01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
question and you did say whether it
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
prevails or not
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
we could offer a second amendment on at
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
the committee level and that could
 
01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:42.799 align:start position:0%
change the motion of this amendment how
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
it whether they prevailed or not now you
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
are not allowing the other member to
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment that i take a big
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
objection to mr chair you went back on
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
your word
 
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
i came here to do my due diligence and
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
not having that
 
01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do my duty
 
01:05:05.599 --> 01:05:06.630 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do my duty
is

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
unacceptable i am very frustrated at
 
01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
and i feel very cheated in terms of not
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
being able to provide my duty my service
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mister well i if if i
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
led anyone to believe that we could have
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
two amendments at the same time
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
on the floor
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
then i misspoke no we never no we did
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
not think that mr chair yes no what you
 
01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:36.799 align:start position:0%
said was we could take up amendments in
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
order i repeated that back to you and
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
that was the clarification we take up
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
one amendment and then we can take up
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
another amendment if we choose to i
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
would like to make
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:48.950 align:start position:0%
a motion

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
put represent to um adopt representative
 
01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:52.950 align:start position:0%
put represent to um adopt representative

amendment
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
which we can do because we have disposed
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
of the first amendment
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%

01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative piamonte's amendment i
 
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair so um just with the
 
01:59:21.750 --> 01:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
cursory look of the amendment
 
01:59:24.390 --> 01:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
am i to understand that now we're taking
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
another housing bill and we're turning
 
01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
it this one into a school district
 
01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
no i don't believe that's the intention
 
01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
what's the result well um i'm i'm
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
looking at um in on page
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
six of the amen of the the amendment
 
01:59:48.790 --> 01:59:48.800 align:start position:0%
1848 h on line 24
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
it introduces a new section
 
01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
municipal budget law school district
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
budget caps
 
01:59:59.350 --> 01:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
that titles online 22. so the original
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
bill had to do with training and
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
procedures for zoning and planning
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
boards and relative to financial
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
investments and incentives for
 
02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
affordable housing development
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
so where we are dealing with a crisis in
 
02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
this state on affordable housing
 
02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:16.550 align:start position:0%
this state on affordable housing
development

02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
development
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
we're now taking that bill and adding
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
language in
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
pertaining to school
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry school district budget cap so
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
i just want to understand um from the
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
amendment sponsor why he felt that
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
sb 400 needed to address school district
 
02:00:38.550 --> 02:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
budget caps well
 
02:00:41.189 --> 02:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
i can say that when we
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
do look at amendments oftentimes
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
items are added or subtracted and in
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
this case you found an item that was
 
02:00:48.239 --> 02:00:49.350 align:start position:0%
this case you found an item that was
added

02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
added
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:54.149 align:start position:0%
so uh
yes

02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:00:58.149 --> 02:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
i am
 
02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
really distressed by some of the changes
 
02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
in this
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
um amendment particularly
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
i am
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
astonished that we are changing the
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
workforce housing rules so that they
 
02:01:19.109 --> 02:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
are not required to be available
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
any place not already served by both
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
water and sewer systems owned or
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
operated by a political subdivision
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
public utility or other public water and
 
02:01:32.790 --> 02:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
sewer utility so what that means is that
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
if a developer of workforce housing is
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
willing to extend water and sewer this
 
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
would uh
 
02:01:41.910 --> 02:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
they would allow the the town to say no
 
02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
we don't want you to do that
 
02:01:47.669 --> 02:01:47.679 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a bad plan i'm also
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
distressed by the fact that we've got
 
02:01:52.149 --> 02:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
all this language in here about uh
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
public health officers
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
not at all i understand that we can put
 
02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:00.639 align:start position:0%
anything in any bill that we want but i
 
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
just think this is a bad plan to stick
 
02:02:05.109 --> 02:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
all this stuff in about
 
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
school district tax caps
 
02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
public health officers and then this
 
02:02:11.910 --> 02:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
whole business about
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
telling towns
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
this whole business about water and
 
02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
sewer extensions i just think this is a
 
02:02:20.070 --> 02:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
terrible idea and we should
 
02:02:22.870 --> 02:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
not support it
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
yes representatives davis
 
02:02:27.910 --> 02:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
02:02:30.070 --> 02:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i have to echo
 
02:02:33.030 --> 02:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative vance point
 
02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
and i will say that the original bill
 
02:02:37.510 --> 02:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
was supported between the electronic
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
filing emails and
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
the amounts of paper
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
210 in support to 30 opposed and i think
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
we ought to listen to the will of the
 
02:02:51.030 --> 02:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
people that we are representing i think
 
02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
people that we are representing i think
the

02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:51.210 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:51.210 --> 02:02:53.510 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:02:55.830 --> 02:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
public health officer infra
 
02:02:57.669 --> 02:02:57.679 align:start position:0%
changes and the
 
02:02:59.750 --> 02:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
budget cap changes are not what was
 
02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
intended by this bill and removing the
 
02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:02.950 align:start position:0%
intended by this bill and removing the
house

02:03:02.950 --> 02:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
housing champion aspect of the bill to
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
encourage towns to
 
02:03:10.229 --> 02:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
do their due diligence in providing
 
02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
workforce housing is a shame
 
02:03:16.470 --> 02:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative davis
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'd like to also echo
 
02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:21.679 align:start position:0%
what my colleagues have just said
 
02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to add that
 
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
we have cropping up here again
 
02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
a bill that passed on the house floor
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
limiting municipalities in their powers
 
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
to promulgate
 
02:03:37.350 --> 02:03:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh bylaws and regulations
 
02:03:40.390 --> 02:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
and limiting them to um
 
02:03:42.310 --> 02:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
not look out for the well-being of their
 
02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
citizens that language is struck
 
02:03:47.350 --> 02:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
from the ability of municipalities to
 
02:03:49.589 --> 02:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
govern on behalf of their citizens the
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
only thing they're allowed to do now is
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
to preserve their property
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
property mr chair that most citizens in
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire cannot obtain because it
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
is too damn expensive and why we are
 
02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
turning these bills that will address
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
this urgent crisis that so many people
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
are facing so many businesses are facing
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
in our state is beyond my comprehension
 
02:04:17.109 --> 02:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:19.669 --> 02:04:19.679 align:start position:0%

mr chair
if

02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.199 align:start position:0%

who spoke before me
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
and if i look at the original bill it is
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
bill with the intent of looking at the
 
02:04:37.199 --> 02:04:38.470 align:start position:0%
bill with the intent of looking at the
housing

02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:04:42.550 --> 02:04:42.560 align:start position:0%

just to show that this is another

02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:24.400 align:start position:0%

what are we trying to tell and how do i
 
02:05:37.109 --> 02:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
even support this
 
02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
to bring and tell my constituents that i
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
have voiced their concerns
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
like my
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
colleague representative gilman pointed
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
out i have received so many emails about
 
02:05:54.149 --> 02:05:54.159 align:start position:0%
how important this is
 
02:05:54.159 --> 02:05:55.189 align:start position:0%
how important this is
and

02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
to just negate that
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
and come sit here because i have the
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
power to vote and do what i wish to do
 
02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:06.310 align:start position:0%
power to vote and do what i wish to do
this

02:06:06.310 --> 02:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
is very unsettling
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
i cannot support this amendment
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative manjapudi i'm sorry
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative mitchell
 
02:06:17.669 --> 02:06:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's okay thank you mr chair um
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
page six lines 31-32 the annual increase
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
for inflation shall be there be a fixed
 
02:06:25.430 --> 02:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
percentage including zero or an
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
inflation index published by the uh by
 
02:06:31.430 --> 02:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
the bls it says an inflation index it
 
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't say which inflation index can
 
02:06:35.189 --> 02:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
somebody please explain which inflation
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
index is that for the previous year can
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
you take the probability of the page and
 
02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
page i'm sorry page 6 lines 31 and 32.
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
and again and inflation index and means
 
02:06:48.159 --> 02:06:49.030 align:start position:0%
and again and inflation index and means
any

02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
so it you could pick 1932 for an
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
inflation index you could pick 2021
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
and it gives a discretion to any
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
school district to pick the one that
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
they want to use i as a as a
 
02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative to planning to my budget
 
02:07:06.069 --> 02:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
committee will be suggesting that they
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
pick the lowest inflation index that
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
they can or the highest one rather that
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
they can find thank you
 
02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair to answer the
 
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
representative's question that is
 
02:07:21.189 --> 02:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely right it is an inflation
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
index published and it would be up to
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
school district in the individuals
 
02:07:32.550 --> 02:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
putting the the article
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
on the warrant
 
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i have also heard
 
02:07:45.030 --> 02:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
02:07:47.109 --> 02:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
objections to the original bill because
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
of the incentives of the housing
 
02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:50.550 align:start position:0%
of the incentives of the housing
champion

02:07:50.550 --> 02:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
champion
 
02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:51.830 align:start position:0%
champion
uh

02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:53.109 align:start position:0%
uh
towns

02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
towns
 
02:07:54.629 --> 02:07:54.639 align:start position:0%
getting an extra
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
chance at money from the state and i
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
just wanted to
 
02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
let people understand about the
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
certified local government program
 
02:08:05.910 --> 02:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
which a town has to prove their interest
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
in preserving history they have to have
 
02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
a historic or heritage commission
 
02:08:14.550 --> 02:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
they have to provide examples of their
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
minutes and and bylaws and
 
02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
et cetera and so
 
02:08:21.990 --> 02:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
communities that establish themselves as
 
02:08:23.910 --> 02:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
a certified local government
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
have first dibs on some federal money
 
02:08:28.550 --> 02:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
because we have promised to
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh preserve our towns as much as
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
possible and i think that this is the
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
same i think this bill and the housing
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
champions communities that's the same
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
kind of incentive to get the get the
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
work that we need to get more housing
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
for people who work in our towns i i see
 
02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
no problem with getting uh to the head
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
of the line if you do your job if your
 
02:08:52.229 --> 02:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
town does its job they should go to the
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
head of the line
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mercer do you
 
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
see no further
 
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
one more question mr chair
 
02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:06.390 align:start position:0%
one more question mr chair
sorry

02:09:06.390 --> 02:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:09:10.470 --> 02:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
um so we do have another amendment
 
02:09:12.550 --> 02:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh so after this
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
can we present another amendment
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
once we uh
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
complete our business with this first
 
02:09:21.189 --> 02:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
amendment and you can and would you
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
recognize mr chair if there is
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to do it
 
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
what would that opportunity look like a
 
02:09:31.589 --> 02:09:31.599 align:start position:0%
failed amendment that only if it's a
 
02:09:34.229 --> 02:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
failed amendment no that's that's not
 
02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:40.629 --> 02:09:40.639 align:start position:0%
we have a motion now to
 
02:09:42.069 --> 02:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
pass an amendment
 
02:09:45.189 --> 02:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh if if there's a if this mo if that
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
that was not the process it was uh for
 
02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
the last one remember well the only
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
reason we did that is because i
 
02:09:57.510 --> 02:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
recognized representative van and i
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have
 
02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
and i owed her an opportunity to speak
 
02:10:03.669 --> 02:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
and present that amendment because i did
 
02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
that that was a mistake of the chairman
 
02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
okay so in that case
 
02:10:10.950 --> 02:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
i would have really appreciated the fact
 
02:10:13.109 --> 02:10:13.119 align:start position:0%
that you know we don't have an
 
02:10:15.189 --> 02:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present because you don't
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
recognize if
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
if it's a predetermined so do i have to
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
put a put it in your list to be a
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
recognized for an amendment is that the
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
process i'm just trying to understand no
 
02:10:29.109 --> 02:10:29.119 align:start position:0%
we have an amendment on the floor right
 
02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
now we need to
 
02:10:34.629 --> 02:10:34.639 align:start position:0%
dispose of that and then if if the
 
02:10:36.870 --> 02:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
result is that the amendment fails then
 
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
we can make another emotion
 
02:10:41.350 --> 02:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
and that's not the process i was used to
 
02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
this is my fifth term
 
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
and this is my first time on this
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
committee i'm just
 
02:10:49.589 --> 02:10:49.599 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how do i
 
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
make it a motion or i can by the way i
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
confirm that with the
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
clerk uh
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
about an hour ago uh and that was
 
02:11:01.589 --> 02:11:01.599 align:start position:0%
including the mistake i made with
 
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative mann of how i could undo
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
that and i i understand it very clear
 
02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:07.910 align:start position:0%
that and i i understand it very clear
now

02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay just one more last clarification
 
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
in the past you had asked if we had a
 
02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
motion to make i could jump in and see
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
it but
 
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
if you don't recognize as a chair you
 
02:11:23.189 --> 02:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
have the prerogative to
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
recognize the predetermined reps so i
 
02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
feel like my voice is being qualched so
 
02:11:31.990 --> 02:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
if there is a way that i could bring an
 
02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:33.589 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair hey let's face it
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
um the democrats are in the minority the
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
republicans are in the majority what the
 
02:11:54.870 --> 02:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
majority wants is what the majority is
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
going to get and that is the lot of the
 
02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:58.069 align:start position:0%
going to get and that is the lot of the
minority

02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
minority
 
02:12:01.270 --> 02:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
that is a fact of life today in this
 
02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
committee i would just like to say
 
02:12:04.159 --> 02:12:05.750 align:start position:0%
committee i would just like to say
publicly

02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
publicly
 
02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:06.629 align:start position:0%
publicly
that

02:12:06.629 --> 02:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:10.229 --> 02:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
the majority seems to want to go against
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
the wishes of the people who elected
 
02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:13.350 align:start position:0%
the wishes of the people who elected
them

02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
and that puzzles me
 
02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
it puzzles me because the wishes of the
 
02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
people have been clearly expressed
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
in all of our email accounts and all of
 
02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:25.189 align:start position:0%
in all of our email accounts and all of
the

02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:27.510 --> 02:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
electronically recorded
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
votes of opposition or support to the
 
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
various bills that we've been hearing
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
why we continue to ignore the voices of
 
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
the people who sent us here is a mystery
 
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
to me that i do not think we can solve
 
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you we have uh we're going to take
 
02:12:46.950 --> 02:12:46.960 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair i want to um
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
piggyback on what my colleague from
 
02:12:57.030 --> 02:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
lebanon has said about the wishes of
 
02:12:59.189 --> 02:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
granite staters we're here not to
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
represent our party we're here to
 
02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
represent the people of new hampshire
 
02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
and i just want to review the people
 
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
that came out in support of senate bill
 
02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:10.069 align:start position:0%
that came out in support of senate bill
400

02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
400
 
02:13:10.079 --> 02:13:12.470 align:start position:0%
400
the

02:13:12.470 --> 02:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire housing authority
 
02:13:17.910 --> 02:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire realtors
 
02:13:20.310 --> 02:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
the housing action of new hampshire

business and industry association we
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
even had a letter from governor sununu
 
02:13:27.669 --> 02:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
for us to think that we know better than
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
people that are working at the front
 
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
lines of this housing crisis i think is
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
quite arrogant and i would implore
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
my colleagues from across the aisle to
 
02:13:43.270 --> 02:13:43.280 align:start position:0%

and put your party aside on this issue
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%

02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%

speaker
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i would like to point
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
out that the provisions of
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill 400 are in fact contained in
 
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
and it does in fact address affordable
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
housing development so if
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment is not supported then you
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%

sure thank you mr chair um
 
02:15:54.629 --> 02:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to express uh i'm gonna
 
02:15:57.430 --> 02:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
pile on because uh i can and you've
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
given me the opportunity so i thank you
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
for that but we worked for three hours i
 
02:16:03.350 --> 02:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
had three hours in the public hearing on
 
02:16:05.589 --> 02:16:05.599 align:start position:0%
400 had an amendment that seemed to work
 
02:16:07.830 --> 02:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
through so much of the issues that we
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
had we came to an understanding that
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
seems to will help the state of new
 
02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i feel this bill has been
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
corrupted in a way that ignores that and
 
02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
now we're going to have a split vote you
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
know it's going to be 10 to 8 on this
 
02:16:21.830 --> 02:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a debate on the
 
02:16:24.149 --> 02:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
floor not on the merits of the bill but
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
the way that the bill was then
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
introduced with its amendment and that
 
02:16:30.390 --> 02:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
is to hear again what you've heard a
 
02:16:32.309 --> 02:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
time and time again for my colleagues
 
02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
not what we are supposed to be doing in
 
02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
here i know it's proper i know that's
 
02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
fine but this is not what we are
 
02:16:39.990 --> 02:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing thank you mr chair
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative manchuti last
 
02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:44.469 align:start position:0%
thank you representative manchuti last
speaker

02:16:44.469 --> 02:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for giving me an
 
02:16:51.190 --> 02:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my mind of course
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
this is appalling to me
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
this is my fifth term 10 years
 
02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
and this by far has been the most
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
choking of partisan
 
02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
not in the interest best interest of our
 
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
granite staters when people are homeless
 
02:17:18.950 --> 02:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
people working two jobs have no roof
 
02:17:21.030 --> 02:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
over their head because they can't
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
on one hand i work on trying to provide
 
02:17:31.669 --> 02:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
a shelter and a home to people who are
 
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
homeless not because the choice they
