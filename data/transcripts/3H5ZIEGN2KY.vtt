Region and today I am introducing a
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to repeal the
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
so-called Blain Amendment or no Aid
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment from our
 
00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
constitution this 187 77 amendment to
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
our constitution is part two article 3
 
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
and States provided nevertheless that no
 
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
money raised by taxation shall ever be
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
granted or applied for the use of the
 
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
schools of Institute or of institutions
 
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:49.160 align:start position:0%
of any religious sect or
 
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
denomination there are two primary
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
reasons that this repeal should be done
 
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
first is the
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
constitutionality based upon the US
 
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision in uh espanosa
 
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
versus Montana Department of Revenue
 
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
case last June these State Blain
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
amendments are violations of the first
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
amendment of our US
 
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution I will leave more of on
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
that uh topic to our next speaker so I
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
would like to discuss the second reason
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
for this legislation and this
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
repeal the Blain amendment is a relic of
 
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
a period of anti-religious
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
bigotry as such it has no place in our
 
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
constitution in the mid 1800s the common
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
School concept was started by Horus man
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts with the thought that
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
in order for a civil society there
 
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
needed to be a civil and religious
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
education for all since our nation was
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
primarily a Protestant Nation the
 
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
schools were no different religion and
 
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
reading from Bibles was part of the
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
common school
 
00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:02.839 align:start position:0%
education but problems arose with the
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
migration of Catholics from several
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
countries but primarily Ireland in order
 
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
to escape the Potato Famine these
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
immigrants arrived here and found that
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
their children were being taught
 
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
religious Concepts contrary to their own
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
this led to discrimination and
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
violence in Philadelphia there were
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
riots over which version of the Bible
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
was to be used in school
 
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
in Maine a Catholic a Catholic Church
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
was burned and the priest tarred and
 
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
feathered and these were not isolated
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
incidents if you want to look at our
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
website repeal
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%

approaching the shoreline where a

teacher is protecting students from
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
these Catholic
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
priests as these non-protestant groups
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
began to form their own schools there
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
was a backlash The Establishment
 
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
Protestant groups did not want these sex
 
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
like Catholics which gave term to the
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
term sectarian to have access to public
 
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
funds for
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
Education school funding rather than
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
School prayer and bibles became an issue
 
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.160 align:start position:0%
and a political issue in
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
1875 president ulyses S Grant gave a
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
speech calling for a constitutional
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
amendment to forbid States from using
 
00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:42.279 align:start position:0%
public funds for any school that taught
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
sectarian AKA Catholic
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
tenants James Blaine of Maine was the
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
speaker of the United States House of
 
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
Representatives and a friend of
 
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.629 align:start position:0%
Representatives and a friend of
President

00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
President
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
Grant soon
 
00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519 align:start position:0%
after a grant speech Blaine introduced a
 
00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
constittution tional Amendment providing
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
that no state raised tax funds be
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
provided to any religious sect Blain
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
envisioned himself to be uh the next
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
president of the United States and this
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
would be an issue that would bring him
 
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.230 align:start position:0%
would be an issue that would bring him
that

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
presidency the amendment passed the US
 
00:12:20.189 --> 00:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
house but fell just short of the
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
necessary two-thirds votes in the Senate
 
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.240 align:start position:0%
but the anti-catholic movement did not
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
end there states began adopting their
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
own blame type amendments and today
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
there are some 38 states with such
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
amendments the New Hampshire
 
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution was amended just two years
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
later in
 
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
1877 to include the Blain Amendment it
 
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
was clearly modeled after the failed US
 
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution amendment to extend
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
anti-religious anti-catholic
 
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
prohibitions but attempts to defend
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
common schools continued in numerous
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
locations into the 20th
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
centuries I will note that many of these
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
efforts were promoted by the clue plux
 
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
Clan uh including very much so in Maine
 
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:11.959 align:start position:0%
bla amends were Blain amendments were
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
born of bigotry religious bigotry is no
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
better than racial
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
bigotry we have seen um the Uproar about
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
Dr Zeus Seuss recently um tearing down
 
00:13:28.189 --> 00:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
of statues around the country including
 
00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
George Washington Abraham Lincoln uh
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
we've seen a statue defaced with red
 
00:13:36.389 --> 00:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
paint here in New Hampshire and other
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
calls for other statutes to be
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
removed but what needs to be torn down
 
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
are the statutes that promote
 
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
bigotry New Hampshire needs to repeal
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
this now un unconstitutional remnant of
 
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
anti-religious anti-catholic
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
bigotry I have introduced this amendment
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
to do just that this should not be a
 
00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
political issue the Blain Amendment
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
repeal should bring us together so that
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
we can eliminate this remnant of
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
bigotry Mr chairman I would appreciate

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
lawyer and a senior Attorney At The
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
Institute for justice I was also one of
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
the lead attorneys on the esposa case
 
00:14:55.069 --> 00:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
that many of you are familiar with and
 
00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
that representative cordelli mentioned
 
00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:00.759 align:start position:0%
uh I urge you you to repeal the Blain
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
Amendment for three reasons first as
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli testified this
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
amendment has a ugly history that is
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
very well documented and it would be
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
really important to remove this Mark of
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
bigotry from the New Hampshire
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution Second is for
 
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.230 align:start position:0%
Constitution Second is for
constitutional

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
00:15:27.069 --> 00:15:27.079 align:start position:0%
reasons that it is very hard to think of
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
a situation where the Blain Amendment
 
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
could be constitutionally applied and
 
00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
that's because of two recent Supreme
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
Court decisions uh the first was the
 
00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
Trinity Lutheran case that came out in
 
00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:43.399 align:start position:0%
2018 in that case the court found that
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
Missouri's Blain Amendment could not be
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
constitutionally applied to exclude a
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
religious preschool from participating
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
in a state grant
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
program and then just last summer the
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said that Montana's Blain
 
00:15:58.269 --> 00:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment could not be constitutionally
 
00:15:58.279 --> 00:15:59.350 align:start position:0%
Amendment could not be constitutionally
applied

00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
applied
 
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
to exclude religious schools from
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
participating in a school choice
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
program after these decisions it's very
 
00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
very difficult to think how could the
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
Blain Amendment be constitutionally
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
applied and that's because we already
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
have the federal establishment clause
 
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
which already protects separation of
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
church and state so when you look at
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
what the bla amendment is doing beyond
 
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
the federal Establishment Clause all
 
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
it's doing is discriminating against
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
religion and that violat the federal
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
protections for free
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
exercise the third reason for supporting
 
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
its repeal is by keeping it in a New
 
00:16:38.829 --> 00:16:38.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution you are inviting
 
00:16:38.839 --> 00:16:40.590 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution you are inviting
frivolous

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
frivolous
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
litigation especially when it comes to
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
school choice programs you Hampshire has
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
a school choice program they're
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
currently considering expanding one of
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
their programs and passing another one
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
as long as this is in the Constitution
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
school choice opponents are going to
 
00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
seize on it to bring lawsuits against
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
these programs these lawsuits will be
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
completely frivolous and the state will
 
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
win in defending the programs but it's
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
still going to cost the state a lot of
 
00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
time and a lot of money to defend these
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
frivolous lawsuits and we shouldn't have
 
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:13.720 align:start position:0%
to worry about that I'm just going to
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
make one final point and that's about
 
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:19.959 align:start position:0%
the aclu's written testimony uh I have a
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
lot of respect for the ACLU we work with
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
them on a lot of issues but we are on
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
opposite sides when it comes to this and
 
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to note that their test money
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
talks about the validity of the Blain
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
Amendment but it doesn't even address
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
the Trinity Lutheran or espanosa
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
decision I think I think it's um very
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to have a meaningful
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
conversation about the bla Amendment
 
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
without talking about the Supreme Court
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
opinions uh the written testimony from
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
the ACLU also argues that the Blain
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is actually doing a good thing
 
00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:54.919 align:start position:0%
by excluding religious schools from
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
school choice programs I'm not sure how
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
they can say that considering that we
 
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
now know that excluding religious
 
00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
schools from a school choice program is
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional as the Supreme Court
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
just said last summer so with that I
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
will uh take any questions thank you
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
very much very much Miss Smith uh
 
00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.789 align:start position:0%
very much very much Miss Smith uh
represent

00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
Miler uh thank you uh councelor Smith
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
for being with us today since you've
 
00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
been involved in both the uh well you've
 
00:18:25.549 --> 00:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
involved in the espanosa case but are
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
well aware of the Trinity case could
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
youe for the committee specifically
 
00:18:33.789 --> 00:18:33.799 align:start position:0%
outline the issues in each of those
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
cases so that we're clear on what was
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
the basis for those cases thank you very
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
much sure of course uh so the what those
 
00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.039 align:start position:0%
cases both came down to is that the
 
00:18:49.149 --> 00:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
government has to be neutral toward
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
religion and religious institutions they
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
can't preference them um they also can't
 
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:56.200 align:start position:0%
discriminate against them they have to
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
be neutral and in both cases the Supreme
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
Court found that the Blain amendment was
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
not being neutral and was instead
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
discriminating against religious
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
institutions and religious schools and I
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
could talk about the facts in each of
 
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
those case cases so in Trinity Lutheran
 
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
what had happened was that a uh Missouri
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
had a state grant program to allow
 
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
schools um and other education entities
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
to refurbish their playgrounds uh there
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
was a whole bunch of groups that applied
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
for this Grant including a religious
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
preschool and daycare uh and the state
 
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:36.919 align:start position:0%
said I'm sorry uh you qualify the F this
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
grant but we're going to have to exclude
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
you because of our Blain Amendment
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
because you are religious and we can't
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
give funds to a religious entity this
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
went all the way up to the Supreme Court
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
and the Supreme Court said absolutely
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
not this is discriminating against
 
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
religion that violates the free exercise
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
clause you have to treat them equally to
 
00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
non-religious groups
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
what H something similar happened in
 
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
Espinosa Montana had passed a school
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
choice program uh that was meant to
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
allow children to choose to attend the
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
school of their choice whether that was
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
a religious school or a non-religious
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
school but the agency the state agency
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
that was supposed to administer the
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
program that was the Department of
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue passed a rule that said children
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
could only use the scholarships to
 
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
attend nonreligious schools and they
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
based that on Montana's Blain Amendment
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
this went all the way up to the US
 
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court again and the court again
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
said you cannot apply the Blain
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
amendment to exclude religious schools
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
from this other from the a school choice
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
program this is a generally available
 
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:49.480 align:start position:0%
program uh everyone is supposed to
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
participate and if you discriminate
 
00:20:53.149 --> 00:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
against some people just because of
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
their religious status their religious
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
character you are violating the free
 
00:21:01.149 --> 00:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
exercise clause thank you for the
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you very much are
 
00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
there further questions
 
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
for thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
Miss Smith for taking the question
 
00:21:12.029 --> 00:21:12.039 align:start position:0%
listening to your testimony I going
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
correct that if the C cacr even failed
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
there would be pretty much no impact on
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
Choice program because of those two
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
decisions that you
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned um representative Elson as I
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
said um by keeping this in the
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution you are inviting lawsuits
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
those lawsuits will ultimately fail
 
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
because of the Supreme Court decisions
 
00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:38.039 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime the state is going
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
to have to spend a lot of time and money
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
defending them uh sometimes these
 
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuits can cost over
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
$100,000 uh it's just because someone
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
brings a frivolous lawsuit you still
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
have to defend against it so that's just
 
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
one more reason to remove this provision
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
from the Constitution thank you thank
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
you representative s I think she covered
 
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
it oh you got okay thank you are there
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee oh
 
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
yes represent tan uh thank you for
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you've been
 
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's been talking about the
 
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
Blaine amendment to this point but um in
 
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
Constitution um article six of um
 
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment the First Amendment uh under
 
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
morality and piety has a specific
 
00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
statement and this was written in 17 84
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
that no person shall be compelled to pay
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
towards the support of the of the
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
schools of any sect or denomination
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
which seems to predate the Blain
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that everybody seems to be
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
hammering on um I'm just wondering if if
 
00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039 align:start position:0%
that isn't a clear indication of what
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
the founders at least of our
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
constitution in New Hampshire really
 
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to have
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
happen uh thank you representative
 
00:22:56.909 --> 00:22:56.919 align:start position:0%
Tanner for that question my
 
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the new New
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court has interpreted
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
that provision to just provide the same
 
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
protections that the federal
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
Establishment Clause provides um so
 
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
again neutrality toward religion not
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
discrimination toward religion may I
 
00:23:16.029 --> 00:23:16.039 align:start position:0%
have a followup on
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
that um could you give me the um case
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
for that please uh I don't have uh I
 
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
don't have it off the top of my head
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner but I'm happy to
 
00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:29.799 align:start position:0%
follow with you after the committee
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
information further questions from the
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative M thank you
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair this is a history question is
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
supposal legal question which you may
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
not be able to speak to but but uh Blain
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
was a main Republican he ran for
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
president uh St Republican and the the
 
00:23:57.149 --> 00:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
Catholic Church throughout most of our
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
history certainly in the 19th century
 
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
was overwhelmingly Democrat so I'm
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
wondering I don't know if you can speak
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
to this but I'm very interested in this
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
in that was were these Blain amendments
 
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
more than just uh religious based or was
 
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
there a political component to also uh
 
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
diminish uh the Democrats or democrat
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
Catholics or is that anything that you
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
have uh have heard
 
00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:27.159 align:start position:0%
about I'm not sure if I could comment on
 
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
that specific spefically I can tell you
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
that representative Blaine um well he
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
was also a senator he was a
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
representative um he had very he had a
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
lot of political aspirations and wanted
 
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
to run for president of the United
 
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
States and this anti-catholicism was not
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
just happening in his state but across
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
the country and he was very opportun
 
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
opportunistic and he wanted to run on
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
this anti- Catholic sentiment that was
 
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
going across the entire country and he
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
was hoping it would launch him into the
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you the the the it's been
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
posited that this is not only religious
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
bigotry but a political way for Blaine
 
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
and and the Republicans of the time to
 
00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:14.279 align:start position:0%
diminish Democrats which which I think
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
is uh is potentially interesting thank
 
00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:18.919 align:start position:0%

House of
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
Representatives I grew up in a
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
multiethnic miltown in Eastern
 
00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts It embarrasses me to tell
 
00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
you that my grandmother was a
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
bigot even at an early age I couldn't
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
understand her hate one day when I was
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
about eight I asked her Nana do you hate
 
00:26:42.389 --> 00:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
the Irish the French Canadians and the
 
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
Italians because they're Catholic or do
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
you hate Catholics because they're Irish
 
00:26:50.389 --> 00:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
French Canadians and Italians her answer
 
00:26:50.399 --> 00:26:52.389 align:start position:0%
French Canadians and Italians her answer
was

00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
yes where did that bigotry come from one
 
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
answer is what theologians call Original
 
00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
Sin which some people word as that
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
latent hidden propensity to Badness
 
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
everyone has to some degree or other
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
whether we acknowledge it or not but
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
secondly and not to excuse her Nana was
 
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
a product of her time I'm going to skip
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
a fair bit of my testimony at this point
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
because the previous two speakers have
 
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.240 align:start position:0%
well rehearsed the Blain Amendment and
 
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
that white anglosaxon protest an no
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
nothing movement they were called No
 
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480 align:start position:0%
nothings because when they were
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
challenged about the group that was
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
trying to put Catholics and ethnics in
 
00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:42.039 align:start position:0%
their place they claimed to know nothing
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
I might say ironically they may have
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
been right they believed there was this
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
popish conspiracy to subvert white
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
anglosaxon Protestant America by other
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
religions and
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:58.230 align:start position:0%
religions and
immigrants

00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
immigrants
 
00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.110 align:start position:0%
immigrants
while

00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
barely failing to succeed nationally the
 
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
Blain Amendment language did get into a
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
number of state constitutions now
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
whatever one thinks about how funding
 
00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:14.039 align:start position:0%
for public schools is raised whatever
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
one thinks about charter schools and
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
whatever one thinks about Aid to schools
 
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
that are not public I believe those
 
00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:25.519 align:start position:0%
decisions should be based on 21st
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
century thinking and on 19th century
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
bigotry as we now are looking back over
 
00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:35.519 align:start position:0%
our shoulders to those we once hailed as
 
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
Great American heroes and admit their
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
various faults and failures and
 
00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:42.919 align:start position:0%
sometimes act in response I think we
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
need to do the same both to
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
ourselves and to our own foundational
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
documents to see if similar changes are
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
in order while I'm ashamed of Nana's
 
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
bigotry I'm grateful for my grand
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
Father's Love of all people across the
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
ethnic and racial spectrum and I wish
 
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.350 align:start position:0%
ethnic and racial spectrum and I wish
his

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
inclusivity and not Nana's bigotry would
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
Prevail in the language of our New
 
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.070 align:start position:0%
Prevail in the language of our New
Hampshire

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%

much representative are you willing to
 
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
take questions no I believe you have
 
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
numbers of speakers and the questions
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
would probably be better answered by
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
Representatives Spain and others thank
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%

00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
welcome okay next speaker um is
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
please oh thank you very much Mr chair
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
um so my name is represented Timothy
 
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
Horan I represent the towns of Durham
 
00:29:48.389 --> 00:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
and Madbury um first of all just in the
 
00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
interest of full disclosure um we were
 
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
talking about U President Grant um few
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
minutes ago he happens uh he happens to
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
be a uh first cousin uh I think two or
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
three times removed on my mother's side
 
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:05.519 align:start position:0%
and actually this uh flag that I have
 
00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
here hanging in the background if you
 
00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:10.519 align:start position:0%
see it I CH specifically because it was
 
00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
the union um flag the union flew under
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
led by President Grant in the Civil War
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
so I I uh obviously he was a little bit
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
before my time so I haven't discussed
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
his views on Race but I I don't feel he
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
was a uh I don't feel he was a bigot the
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
um oh the other thing was uh the rent
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
cardelli brought up Dr Zeus I'm a
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
liberal Democrat I'm also like great
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
admirer of do Zeus and I'm very sad
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
those books were are been taken off the
 
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
market but that was a business decision
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
by U basically by the Zeus estate I
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
don't support that I i' never called for
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
any of those books to be uh to be pulled
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
for the shelves especially not on Beyond
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
zebra which is one of my favorites
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
anyway to get I just um I say this is is
 
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
a uh this uh this amendment um is uh
 
00:31:02.269 --> 00:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
first of all it's unnecessary because we
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
have a very rich uh network of religious
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
schools which um may not get uh direct
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh direct State funding and I think it's
 
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
good that they don't get direct State
 
00:31:14.629 --> 00:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
funding but also they do they are
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
heavily subsidized um there was I
 
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
noticed in an oped piece R cordelli
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
yes am I going off topic too much anyway
 
00:31:27.789 --> 00:31:27.799 align:start position:0%
so this this amendment um
 
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
I think we should not be directly
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
supporting schools of any sect um and uh
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
I think this is a uh I think the
 
00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:40.039 align:start position:0%
uh article 83 should stay the way it is
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
um if we do anything to it and this
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
would be within the priew of the
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee we should probably uh
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
strengthen the second half of it which
 
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
has to do with corporations because that
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
was trying to prevent a lot of abuses by
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
corporations which are I think that
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
article part of the article is
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh is not really being not really being
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
observed but anyway
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
so we should uh we should not be a
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
directly subsized religious
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
organizations and also this is also a
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
question of freedom of church from State
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
um so this is a we anybody we give money
 
00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
to we and I don't have a terrible thing
 
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
problem with that but we have to
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
regulate them so we would be uh that
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
would be the church would then be uh
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
regulating the operations of these
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
religious institutions and um so
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
finally also I've been opposed to the
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
school choice um Choice bills and that's
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
not because I'm a bigot um I don't think
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
my objections to that are frivolous so
 
00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
that's um so I'd like to be the first to
 
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
say no to the Constitutional amendment I
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
might might also add
 
00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:48.039 align:start position:0%
UE probably should have probably
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
considering any constitutional amendment
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
in the first year the buying is a waste
 
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
of time because the people had voted on
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
until November 20 202 so this is not a
 
00:32:58.360 --> 00:32:59.070 align:start position:0%
until November 20 202 so this is not a
good

00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:02.519 align:start position:0%
time be considering it and even 2022 is
 
00:33:03.789 --> 00:33:03.799 align:start position:0%
probably not a good time to be voting
 
00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
out going to be a lot more pressing
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
issues for the voters to consider so
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
that's a so that's I'm opposed to the
 
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
bill and I urge you to to itl it and I
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
guess I'd be happy to take any questions
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
if anybody should feel like asking me
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
any thank you very much representative
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for represent
 
00:33:23.789 --> 00:33:23.799 align:start position:0%
Oran representative M thank you m thank
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
you representative foran for taking my
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
question my question simply is
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
do you find any irony in the fact that
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
the bla amendment was put into place
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
around the country by Republicans to to
 
00:33:38.269 --> 00:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
damage a a strong Democratic
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
constituency uh and and yet you're seem
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
to be defending uh the imposition of
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
these amendments by uh bigoted
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
Republicans uh well that was uh that was
 
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:54.519 align:start position:0%
a few years ago that was before that was
 
00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
before my time I I just ECT that uh
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
General Grant would not be supporter of
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
today's Republican party if he were
 
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
still alive today obviously he'd be what
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
180 years old so so today's Republican
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
party is not the Republican party of
 
00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:12.599 align:start position:0%
Lincoln and Grant today's Democratic
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
party is not the uh it's not the uh it's
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
not the party of the Democrats at that
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
time and uh
 
00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
also and part of it also I think has to
 
00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
do with the union movement which the
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
Democrats were a supporter of back then
 
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
which actually the Catholic church had a
 
00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
large role in supporting and so today
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
the Democratic party is the party that
 
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
supports workers rights organized and
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
that was case to some extent back then
 
00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:44.200 align:start position:0%
but so they the this basically dividing
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
line between new parties is totally
 
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
different than it was now so you know
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
that was uh I really can't imagine that
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
ulyses S Grant could have been a member
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
of today's Republican party I I just uh
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you what he beli the opposite of
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
what today's Republicans believe in my
 
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you very much uh further
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
questions not see any hands thank you
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%

the record um Walter Stapleton a
 
00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
representative from from Claremont
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
representing ward 3 Sullivan County
 
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.870 align:start position:0%

District
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
5 um I had uh prepared some remarks but
 
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
they were already more than adequately
 
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
covered by the presenter and first
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
speakers so I'm just going to cut it
 
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
short u um and and and say that uh I'm a
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
I'm am in support of cacr
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
three because while our culture has
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
generally matured out of the ious
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
against Catholic and religious
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
schools many of the Blain amendments
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
still reside in several state
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
constitutions like ours here in New
 
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at article
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
83 but not in article six Bill of Rights
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
referenced uh by representative Tanner
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
and I thank her for uh bringing our
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
attention to that particular article um
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
and it was correct um but no person
 
00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
shall ever be compelled to pay towards
 
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
the suppor of schools or any sect or
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
denomination but it goes
 
00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:40.599 align:start position:0%
on uh and every person denomination or
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
sect shall be equally under the
 
00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
protection of the law and no
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
subordination of any one sect
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
denomination or persuasion to another
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
shall ever be established this is truly
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
the image of the sword of Justice uh
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
that cuts both ways um the double-edged
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
sword if you will um and so it's not a
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
Prohibition article 6 against Aid to um
 
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
religious denominational schools but
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
establishes that um our our state is
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
definitely against bigotry and uh
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
suppression of religious ideals and U
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
and beliefs so it has to be read in read
 
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:31.720 align:start position:0%
in its fully full context and of course
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
it is under the first part the Bill of
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
Rights uh so this is not a Prohibition
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
but this is a declaration of uh the
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
rights of all persons and all faiths and
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
denominations most religious schools in
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
America have been recognized as having
 
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:52.280 align:start position:0%
quality academic programs and notable
 
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
student outcomes which equal or exceed
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
those of many any public schools
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
religious schools are as much a valued
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
asset for our adequate education goals
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
as other component assets of public
 
00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
private and Charter
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
Schools especially when they can benefit
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
a spectrum of students with special
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
needs that may not be available at their
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
resident Public
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
Schools so it's time to remove those
 
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
outdated impediments to full educational
 
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.670 align:start position:0%
outdated impediments to full educational
asset

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
asset
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
utilization by removing this
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
discriminatory language from our state
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
constitution please find cacr 3 as ought

for permitting me to testify uh I uh
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
most of of what I would have to say
 
00:39:17.069 --> 00:39:17.079 align:start position:0%
really has been has been has already
 
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
been said and I know the committee has
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
got a lot of work today so I won't spend
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of time but I would just say I am
 
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
a strong supporter of this uh of this
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
amendment and you know i h i I have to
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
say and I think maybe just just for some
 
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.470 align:start position:0%
say and I think maybe just just for some
some

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
perspective um I that I bring to this um
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
I was raised as a Catholic I still
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
consider myself a Catholic although I'll
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
to to be very honest with you I'm not
 
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:42.280 align:start position:0%
sure I would classify myself as a very
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
good Catholic I don't go to church
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
regularly I'm not a particularly
 
00:39:50.589 --> 00:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
religious person uh my wife is Jewish um
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
we raised our our son uh in the Jewish
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
faith um and he's uh and my wife I I
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
think would probably say that she's not
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
a particularly religious person either
 
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
and neither is my son um I and I say all
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
that because um I think it's important
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
to understand that to the extent there's
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
a suggestion that it is sort of
 
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.150 align:start position:0%
a suggestion that it is sort of
religious

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
religious
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
zealots that are the people that are
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
supporting this amendment I don't think
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
that's true it's certainly not true in
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
my case I am not in any sense um uh
 
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
religious zealot but I do think uh for
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
the reasons that um
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the prior speakers have have said
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
that this this amendment is really um uh
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry this the the the provision
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
of the Blain Amendment that's currently
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
in the constitution is really a relic of
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
of anti-catholic discrimination uh that
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
that we should not permit to remain in
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and I think it's true
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
that um uh as as uh one of the speakers
 
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839 align:start position:0%
said who was involved involved in the
 
00:40:59.790 --> 00:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
challenges in the espanosa case and and
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
The Trinity Lutheran case that if this
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
does even though this this amend this
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
language in the current constitution is
 
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
not uh will not be effective anymore
 
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
because of the federal Supreme Court
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
decisions um the fact that it's in there
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
um will give you know excuses for
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
litigation um uh based on the state
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
constitution in the hopes that somehow
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know you can you could get uh the
 
00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
the state supreme court to to construe
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
the the the provision to to uphold its
 
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:39.880 align:start position:0%
validity and in some way you know
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh carve out some exception from what
 
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:44.839 align:start position:0%
this from what the uh US Supreme Court
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
has said it'll cost everybody a lot of
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
money it's not worth it and it's it's
 
00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
also not worth having in the
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution a provision that U that is
 
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
inv valid and that has such um a really
 
00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
sort of pernicious history of where it
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
came from and what it was based upon um
 
00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
so for all those reasons um I urge the
 
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:13.240 align:start position:0%
committee to to uh uh vote this uh
 
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment as ought to pass and
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions um that
 
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
anybody might have thanks very much uh
 
00:42:23.309 --> 00:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
justice Lynn are there questions
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
for Bob Lynn I I have a question for you
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Lynn um we heard earlier this
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
morning from uh attorney uh Smith um
 
00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
that it would be frivolous for a lawsuit
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
to be brought uh in the State uh and be
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
live the gate against the Blain
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment do you also agree it would be
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
frivilous uh to uh bring a lawsuit
 
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
fourth in this
 
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
state you know it would it would be hard
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
I think it's I I think it's hard to to
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
say that as a blanket matter without
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
knowing exactly what the what the
 
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:03.559 align:start position:0%
legislation would uh what what the
 
00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuit was about for example I I as I
 
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
understand the the current case law from
 
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
the US Supreme Court for example I think
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
that that if New Hampshire were to pass
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
a law that
 
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
allowed for for some kind of Public
 
00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:26.839 align:start position:0%
Funding of
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
actual relig of Public Funding of of a
 
00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:32.559 align:start position:0%
school that
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
taught that taught people how to become
 
00:43:38.109 --> 00:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
clergymen I think that there is a supre
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
a US Supreme Court case from the state
 
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
of Washington I don't remember the name
 
00:43:43.549 --> 00:43:43.559 align:start position:0%
right now but it's relatively recent
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
case that said that it was all right for
 
00:43:50.549 --> 00:43:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh a state to prevent that in other
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
words if the if the if it's not simply
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
preventing funding to religious schools
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
um that might happen to teach religion
 
00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
as a course along with history and math
 
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
and all that um that's perfectly okay
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
and the state can't discriminate against
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
that but if a but what a State might be
 
00:44:11.549 --> 00:44:11.559 align:start position:0%
able to do is say we are not going to
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
provide uh Public Funding for a school
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
that teaches you to become a priest or a
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
rabbi or a a uh you know Protestant
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
clergyman if that's the purpose of it
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
that might that might go too far so I
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
suppose and I mean I'm not aware if
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
there's any such proposal in the New
 
00:44:33.069 --> 00:44:33.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature but if there was
 
00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:37.160 align:start position:0%
one like that um I suppose that you know
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
that might be a place where um the Blain
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment would have some validity
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
although I although it's I I I would
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
think that that that anything that would
 
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
violate the Blain that would be
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
permissible under the Blain Amendment
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
would very likely be permissible under
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
the Federal Constitution anyway so again
 
00:44:58.829 --> 00:44:58.839 align:start position:0%
it's really it it's it's really sort of
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
theoretical more than more than anything
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
else I appreciate your taking a time to
 
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
explain that to me thank you um are
 
00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
there further further questions up from
 
00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.430 align:start position:0%
there further further questions up from
committee

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
members thank you very much B thank you
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
very thank you welcome next we have H
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
representative Norm Silber welcome to
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
education thank you very much thank you
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and the members of the
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
committee uh I would like to speak ly in
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
support of cacr 3 and uh that it's she
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
ought to
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
pass I've written in the past about the
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
bla Amendment the history of the bla
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment it's a really sorry history in
 
00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
our country's background the Blain
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
amendment in our constitution I believe
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
perpetuates and embodies bigotry and
 
00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
anti Catholic
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination as has been discussed by
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
The Institute of Justice representative
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
in the two cases that have been before
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
The Supreme Court recently the the
 
00:46:01.549 --> 00:46:01.559 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court is held that these types
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
of Provisions in as applied violate the
 
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:07.640 align:start position:0%
first amendment protection of freedom of
 
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
religion and freedom of exercise I
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
believe that there's an ultimate irony
 
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
that we in New Hampshire have this in
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
our constitution considering how many
 
00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:21.319 align:start position:0%
French Canadian Catholics move down
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
across the border and settled
 
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
particularly in the North Country so we
 
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
have a very large Catholic population in
 
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
the state and it's really ironic that we
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
have a Blain Amendment still in our
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
constitution it is a stain on our state
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's a stain on the reputation of our
 
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
state and it's just plain wrong and
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
really needs to be taken out of our
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
constitution so I urge you to pass cacr
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
3 as an OTP thank you thank you very
 
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
much Mr Silver are there questions for
 
00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.230 align:start position:0%
much Mr Silver are there questions for
Norm

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
Norm
 
00:46:55.950 --> 00:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
Silber looking around I do not see any
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
hands up thank you very much thank you
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
very much thank you next we have
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative Al Al baldasaro welcome
 
00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.910 align:start position:0%
representative Al Al baldasaro welcome
to

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
education oh thank you um Mr chairman uh
 
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
committee members uh this is
 
00:47:14.829 --> 00:47:14.839 align:start position:0%
representative Al Bal deyro calling in
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
from an undisclosed
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
location uh but um I am in support of C
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh 3 and let me explain the reasons why
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know of I'm a father of seven
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
children and four stepchildren uh my
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
four stepchildren were in Christian
 
00:47:35.309 --> 00:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
School my seven children uh at the time
 
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
as a marine couldn't afford it uh which
 
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
I would have preferred because I'm one
 
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
who moved my kids out of one state into
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
another state because of the education
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
was terrible where they were at but this
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
basically is a housekeeping pretty much
 
00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
a housekeeping Bill and what it is is
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
correcting a um something that should be
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
removed from the Constitution that our
 
00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court uh New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:48:03.069 --> 00:48:03.079 align:start position:0%
Court and the US Supreme Court had made
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
decision uh you've had some great
 
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
speakers that came forward and broke it
 
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
down in the law so I'm going to leave it
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
at that that this is a no-brainer for
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
republicans and Democrats uh to correct
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
this and maybe save the state some money
 
00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
down the road for any type of litigation
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for taking my testimony
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh but one thing I did try to sign up on
 
00:48:29.069 --> 00:48:29.079 align:start position:0%
the site and I could not sign in as to
 
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
speak but I did you know sign up and
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
supported the Bill thank you thank you
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and uh thank you to the
 
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing my
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
testimony uh I will be brief um I did
 
00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
send a letter to the committee uh so I
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
think it's pretty apparent what My Views
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
are on this bill I I uh
 
00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
I'm encouraging the house education
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
committee to itl cacr
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
3 um I have a kind of I think the people
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
with whom I served on education know
 
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
that I oppose State funding for private
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
schools I've consistently spoken against
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
that and I will continue to speak
 
00:49:51.309 --> 00:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
against it um I'm not sure I'm not sure
 
00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:52.839 align:start position:0%
what the reasons for for the Blain
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
Amendment at the time but um my personal
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
background is that I spent almost half
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
my career in uh private parochial
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
schools uh I'm I have nothing against
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
them whatsoever I respect people who
 
00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
work in them I think there is dedicated
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
as public schools teachers I sent my um
 
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
children to private
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
schools um was very pleased with the
 
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
education they
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
received um but I don't think the state
 
00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:26.839 align:start position:0%
should fund private education and I
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
think opening this door uh by this
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
amendment would uh just be another crack
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
in the foundation of public
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
education um and I really would
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to work toward
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
um sufficiently funding public education
 
00:50:46.589 --> 00:50:46.599 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
working uh to its detriment so uh I hope
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
my letter explains my opposition I won't
 
00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
take up more of your time I appreciate
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
your time Mr chair members of the
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh thank you for your
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you very much uh
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
honorable dhy uh are there any questions
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
for for
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
Dave I I I have one for you Dave um in
 
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
in our state right now we currently uh
 
00:51:17.789 --> 00:51:17.799 align:start position:0%
support uh through our costume formula
 
00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
students that are attending Public
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
Schools students that are attending uh
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
schools in two other states new
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh which have been approved by the
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Education both in austa
 
00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:36.319 align:start position:0%
andar we uh allow uh students in our
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
tuition program to attend uh schools
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
which have been approved by the local
 
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
school boards both uh private and public
 
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:49.160 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I'm I'm really wondering uh
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
where we're presently supporting uh
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
students in the state to attend private
 
00:51:54.839 --> 00:51:56.109 align:start position:0%
students in the state to attend private
schools

00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
that are approved by the department why
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
is it that we can't send our kids to a
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
private school that is accredited that
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
is approved but is a religious school is
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
it the costing or is it the the issue
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
we've been addressing this bill the
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
Discrimination well I think that's I
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
think discrimination is a big part of it
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
I think accountability is a big part of
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
it um I I understand that private
 
00:52:25.789 --> 00:52:25.799 align:start position:0%
schools have
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
criteria of their own that they uh that
 
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
they meet and I I think in in some
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances geographical circumstances
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
if there's absolutely no other option uh
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
it might be something to consider but I
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
don't think I don't think we should open
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
the door for State funding of private
 
00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.630 align:start position:0%
the door for State funding of private
education

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:52:48.789 --> 00:52:48.799 align:start position:0%
universally thank you very much Dave
 
00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
represent Miler thank you Mr chairman
 
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here uh David
 
00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.069 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here uh David
dhy

00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
dhy
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh in your in your experience as a
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
school counselor as you dealt with kids
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
Etc uh isn't it I mean we've talked this
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
morning about the Blain amendment being
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
discriminatory but isn't it
 
00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:15.160 align:start position:0%
true that some religious schools also
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
discriminate against who can get into
 
00:53:20.349 --> 00:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
their school based upon their personal
 
00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:22.359 align:start position:0%
tenants and beliefs so it's it's a bit
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
of an irony that we're talking about
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
blame being discrimina against Catholics
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
or whomever it might be but then schools
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
can also religious schools private
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
schools can then discriminate against
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
who comes in isn't that correct it is
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
correct and and I have no problem with
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
private schools being discriminatory
 
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
that's their right correct to do that I
 
00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
just don't think the state should fund
 
00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:49.829 align:start position:0%
just don't think the state should fund
that

00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination thank you you're welcome
 
00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.630 align:start position:0%
discrimination thank you you're welcome

replaced uh I'm I'm sorry I didn't quite

this should be
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
replaced not if not if the there's local
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
control and lo the local Town votes some
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
kind of funding that may be uh
 
00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:42.950 align:start position:0%
kind of funding that may be uh
particularly

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
um for that a student in a particular
 
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
situation um so no I don't have any
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
objection to that although I must say
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with that RSA off the
 
00:54:57.069 --> 00:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
top of my head
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you thank
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
you very much uh represent D I do have
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
one followup question here um within our
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
state um and it's been mentioned in this
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
discussion uh between you and others on
 
00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:16.839 align:start position:0%
the committee and myself that um private
 
00:55:20.109 --> 00:55:20.119 align:start position:0%
schools have the ability to reject uh
 
00:55:22.349 --> 00:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
application of a student or to accept a
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
student in that school but are you aware
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
that we have public schools that are
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
under contract with public school
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
districts sending districts that also
 
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
students uh if there are public schools
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
that reject students from their own
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
District I'm not familiar with them I've
 
00:55:45.309 --> 00:55:45.319 align:start position:0%
never had seen that situation in any
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
public school that I've been in yeah I
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
better follow up just clarify what I'm
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
saying we do have some districts that
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
are receiving districts from a smaller
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
District like k28 or a K24 that reserve
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
the right by contract to Res uh to uh
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
screen students and accept uh various
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
types of students so they they have a
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
right to say
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
no I guess if the school board of that
 
00:56:14.029 --> 00:56:14.039 align:start position:0%
District makes that decision that's
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
their right they have the right to
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
control their own policies in their own
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
school but uh I guess I'd have to look
 
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
at the uh specifics to see if it was
 
00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:27.670 align:start position:0%
at the uh specifics to see if it was
actually

00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
discriminatory thank you very much uh
 
00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.029 align:start position:0%
discriminatory thank you very much uh
further

00:56:31.029 --> 00:56:31.039 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
dhy um Mr
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
chair yeah I actually it's a it's a
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
question to you um uh following up on a
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
question you had to um representative
 
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:48.200 align:start position:0%
dhy with respect to um school districts
 
00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.150 align:start position:0%
dhy with respect to um school districts
or

00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
towns um Contracting with um with uh
 
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
private schools for for placing students
 
00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:00.039 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm aware of RSA
 
00:57:05.549 --> 00:57:05.559 align:start position:0%
193 colon 3 Roman 6 which um which which
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
allows for that uh if there is no public
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
school for the child child's grade in
 
00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
the Resident District are there other
 
00:57:15.029 --> 00:57:15.039 align:start position:0%
statutes is there another statute you
 
00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
were referencing within the tuition
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
program statute I don't have that
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
statute number in front of me right now
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
but uh they are allowed to tuition
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
their students to non-sectarian private
 
00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
schools and they are the ones who
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
approve that school not the State Board
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
the local school board does the approval
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
process right and and and and followup
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair that's that's even if the um
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
even if that town or School District
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
provides a public school um that has a
 
00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:51.799 align:start position:0%
you know that that offers um um
 
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
education for the grade for that child
 
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm talking about a district right
 
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
now that might be a k through six K
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
through 8 K through 4 they can send the
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
students to the receiving school that
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't you know has the grades that
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
they don't in the rest of I think we're
 
00:58:12.069 --> 00:58:12.079 align:start position:0%
talking about the same we're talking
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
about the same statute then um U Mr
 
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
chair so it is it's 193 col 3 Roman six
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
but it does require the district not to
 
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
have a it says if there is no Public
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
School for the child's grade in the
 
00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
Resident District uh the school board
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
May assign the child to another Public
 
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
School in another school district or to
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
any nonsectarian private school that has
 
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
been approved as a school tuition
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
program by the school board so yeah they
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
so we're referring to the same um to the
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
same statute I believe Mr chair I'm also
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
referring to the compulsory attendance
 
00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
statute where if a student is attending
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
a school in another state Maine and um
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
Vermont which is has the interstate uh
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
contact with our state and if those
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
States approve that school then it's
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
it's reciprocal we will we will also
 
00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:06.880 align:start position:0%
accept that approval status right but M
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair the compulsory attendance is a
 
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
completely different um um requirement
 
00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
and and what what that's saying is that
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
if you're between the ages of six seven
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
and 18 something like that um you better
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
be attending either your public school a
 
00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
public school in another District a
 
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
private school in New Hampshire a
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
private school approved by another state
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
a charter school or be homeschooled um
 
00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
it's just saying you've got to be in
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
school um um what what you're what what
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
you were I think um directing to um to
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
representative DH was was the ability
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
for a school district to contract with
 
00:59:49.470 --> 00:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
with a private school but they can only
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
do so in specific instances when the
 
00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
grade is grade level programming is not
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
offered in that school
 
00:59:59.309 --> 00:59:59.319 align:start position:0%
district yeah and that's that's correct
 
01:00:02.029 --> 01:00:02.039 align:start position:0%
so what I what is the point to this
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
conversation is that we do have uh
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
Public Schools making contracts with
 
01:00:11.029 --> 01:00:11.039 align:start position:0%
receiving schools that are identified by
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
that statute we're talking
 
01:00:15.029 --> 01:00:15.039 align:start position:0%
about I I think we can have this
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
conversation till the moon comes up
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
again but uh let's go ahead and have a
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
few more uh folks testifying today thank
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
you Mr DH thank you very
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
much um next um next up is Jody
 
01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.069 --> 01:00:41.079 align:start position:0%
please you have to unmute
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry about that just assume that
 
01:00:46.029 --> 01:00:46.039 align:start position:0%
would happen automatically when you got
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
me started okay um for the record my
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
name is Jody Underwood I am Vice chair
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
of the Cen school board and we are a
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
tuition in school district
 
01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:57.039 align:start position:0%
to reiterate what others have said
 
01:00:59.309 --> 01:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
briefly the US Supreme Court recently
 
01:01:02.109 --> 01:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
ruled in Espinosa versus Montana that if
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
a school choice program includes private
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
schools it can't exclude religious
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
private schools New Hampshire's Town
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
tuition program is such a school a
 
01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
choice program so that ruling applies to
 
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
us as a short aside a couple of
 
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
Representatives objected to religious
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
schools getting State funding if cacr 3
 
01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
passes but that's not the case this is
 
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
all local funding so
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
just for the record um so on the one
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
hand it might seem safe to just leave
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
the Now non-functional text in place and
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
simply ignore it as some people have
 
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
suggested but on the other hand the
 
01:01:42.029 --> 01:01:42.039 align:start position:0%
heart and soul of legal argument as it's
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
practiced in this country is to look for
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
ways to distinguish a new case from
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
previous precedents so long as the text
 
01:01:51.069 --> 01:01:51.079 align:start position:0%
remains it'll be a temptation to both
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs and judges to look for some
 
01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
way to say yes we know what the Supreme
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
Court said about Montana's program but
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
different so on a deeper level we
 
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
already encourage judges to ignore the
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
plain language of constitutions for
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
example when they rule that quote no law
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
abridging the freedom of speech unquote
 
01:02:11.069 --> 01:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't include laws restricting what
 
01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
you can say during an election or when
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
they rule that the quote right of the
 
01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
people to keep and bear arms shall not
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
be infringed unquote doesn't mean that
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
arms can't be taxed restricted and
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes banned or that some people
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
can't be prohibited from bearing some
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
arms in some
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
places so the Blain amendment is dead at
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
a federal level um so let's not leaving
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
sorry let's not leave it lying around
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
for judges to make it
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
Undead um that is my testimony I would
 
01:02:42.029 --> 01:02:42.039 align:start position:0%
be happy to take questions about this or
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
about town tuition thank very much Miss
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
Underwood are there questions from the
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much all right
 
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome next up we have Mar
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
bfield I've promoted you go ahead please
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
welcome to
 
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
education thank you for taking my
 
01:03:05.069 --> 01:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
testimony um I will send in written
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
testimony after I speak and as I'm
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
looking through it I'm not going to
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
repeat a lot of what I put in here
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
because other people have mentioned it
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
so I in the interest of time I'm going
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
to skip quite a bit of it but I do want
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
to bring up a couple things um you know
 
01:03:23.309 --> 01:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
some of you may look at the removal of
 
01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
the Blain Amendment as something
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
centered on school choice but the real
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
issue is whether you stand for religious
 
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
bigotry or
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
not one can support the removal of the
 
01:03:35.789 --> 01:03:35.799 align:start position:0%
Blain Amendment because of its
 
01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
historical roots that was based on
 
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
religious big
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
bigotry and debate the merits of school
 
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
choice I have opposed some school choice
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
options at the federal level I agreed
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
with the Heritage Foundation when they
 
01:03:52.589 --> 01:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
opposed Betsy Devo's Federal voucher
 
01:03:54.670 --> 01:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
program but I support support the
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
removal of the Blain Amendment from the
 
01:03:59.230 --> 01:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution so I do think
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
that that um you know you can look at it
 
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
in that way you you can look at each
 
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
school choice proposal and give it its
 
01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
own Merit and discuss and debate whether
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's good for New Hampshire but this
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
amendment should be removed from the
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
state constitution based on everything
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
we've heard here
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
today yes superintendents do tuition out
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
their students and sometimes that's to
 
01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:27.230 align:start position:0%
their students and sometimes that's to
religious

01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
religious
 
01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.269 align:start position:0%
religious
schools

01:04:29.269 --> 01:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
um the other point that seems that has
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
been brought up is this idea of
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
discrimination um in private schools but
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
you heard from a parent just a few days
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
ago during the bullying legislation to
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
remove um so parents can can uh file a
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
lawsuit in that with if that law were to
 
01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
to pass you heard from Shannon bushard
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
who talked about how her daughter was
 
01:05:03.309 --> 01:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
bullied in her public school and that
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
she looked to two different other public
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
schools to take her kids and they to
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
take her daughter and they
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
refused so I think it's important you
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
know I mean as as we're going back and
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
forth with these
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
debates uh it it it seems to be taking
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
away from the real issue which is this
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
amendment and let's focus on what this
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
amendment how it came about what it
 
01:05:32.109 --> 01:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
stands for and how it is a stain on our
 
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution right now by
 
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
all means you you can oppose school
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
choice programs that come before you as
 
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
I said I have opposed the federal school
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
choice program voucher program but this
 
01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
amendment stands on its own let's look
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
at this amendment and whether you agree
 
01:05:54.269 --> 01:05:54.279 align:start position:0%
or oppose school choice this amendment
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be removed um I'm not going to
 
01:05:58.029 --> 01:05:58.039 align:start position:0%
take up any more of your time I just
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring those few points up I
 
01:06:02.269 --> 01:06:02.279 align:start position:0%

01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh for a number of reasons and a lot of
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
them have already been discussed I won't
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
uh burden you with uh repeating him but
 
01:06:52.589 --> 01:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
let me first pick up on what's been an
 
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
underlying theme throughout
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
this hearing and in particular in the
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
words of the uh immediate uh past
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
speaker uh she said that the question is
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
whether you oppose religious bigotry or
 
01:07:08.829 --> 01:07:08.839 align:start position:0%
not and uh other people have made
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
reference to the way the Blain amendment
 
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.230 align:start position:0%
reference to the way the Blain amendment
was

01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
initially uh enacted as a bigoted uh by
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
bigoted people perhaps uh 150 years ago
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
but this uh prohibition on state funding
 
01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
to religious schools is plainly not what
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
you would call religious bigotry it
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't say anybody can't practice their
 
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
religion can't doesn't say anybody can't
 
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
go to parochial schools if they want to
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
it only applies the state
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
funding uh of religious schools and that
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
is in
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
conformance with the uh us and New
 
01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.190 align:start position:0%
conformance with the uh us and New
Hampshire

01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
constitutions uh Set uh very important
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
principle of separation of church and
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
state and uh I don't think that I have
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
heard anybody any previous speaker
 
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned the word separation of church
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
and state but I suggest that that is a
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
fundamental principle in the United
 
01:08:16.269 --> 01:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
States and in New Hampshire and uh the
 
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
that is really the purpose that is
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
served from separating State funding
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
from religious school SCH nobody's
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
prohibited from sending their kids to
 
01:08:26.719 --> 01:08:27.829 align:start position:0%
prohibited from sending their kids to
religious

01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
religious
 
01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
schools uh just that the state is
 
01:08:32.110 --> 01:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
already paying for public schools and
 
01:08:34.749 --> 01:08:34.759 align:start position:0%
the state should not have to divert uh
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
money from public schools which is
 
01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:39.560 align:start position:0%
already inadequate money I might say um
 
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
and and uh share some of that money with
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
uh parochial schools and other religious
 
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
schools um so I think that the second uh
 
01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
principle really is tied to what I just
 
01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned and that is that this state
 
01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
constitution requires State of New
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to provide an adequate
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
education for all children in New
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in adequate public education
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
and that is what the state uh attempts
 
01:09:10.749 --> 01:09:10.759 align:start position:0%
to do uh by funding public education and
 
01:09:12.430 --> 01:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
you know we all pride ourselves in New
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh you know every Granite
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
Stater uh feels Pride when we see the
 
01:09:19.630 --> 01:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
national reports come out and New
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is very high up on the list of
 
01:09:24.749 --> 01:09:24.759 align:start position:0%
states that provides an excellent public
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
education but uh we shouldn't undermine
 
01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
the funding for that public education in
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
fact we should probably Beef It Up and
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
um so again I ask you to itl this bill
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
for this and other reasons and I thank
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
you very much for allowing me to
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
speak thank you very much Mr Barnes are
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
there questions for the
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
presenter I see I see uh re leus has her
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
hand raised okay re like
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
this yes I have a question he was
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
talking about that nobody had referred
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
to the word separation of church and
 
01:10:07.990 --> 01:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
state and I'm wondering where he sees
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
constitution well it is uh taught in
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
every civics class in America I believe
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
um and and I've been uh um mock judge on
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
a mock uh not a mock Court a um the We
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
the People Civics education program in
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
the state for many years and uh high
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
school students are certainly taught
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
about the separation of church and state
 
01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
and the place it comes from is The
 
01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
Establishment Clause and Supreme Court
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
decisions uh
 
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
over Century or so uh that have uh said
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
that the establishment cause can be
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
violated if the state uh gives Aid to
 
01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.830 align:start position:0%
violated if the state uh gives Aid to
religious

01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
religious
 
01:11:07.470 --> 01:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
schools that sort of puts a thumb on the
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
scale of the State uh it's not obviously
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
not even close to literally
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
establishing uh a a state religion but
 
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
it does give State support to people who
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
belong to particular religions and I
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
would say that you know the the
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
religious schools that are getting uh
 
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:32.080 align:start position:0%
the federal money they require their
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
students uh to attend uh classes well to
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
attend chapel and to to attend classes
 
01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
on uh religious Doctrine and uh maybe
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
religious history and I frankly I like
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
to learn about all of those things
 
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
myself but but uh
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
there there is an indoctrination goes on
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
and U in in addition to building the
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
playground uh which uh the first Speaker
 
01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
talked about so the Trinity Lutheran
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
type of case uh and
 
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
Espinosa those are uh perhaps different
 
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
but I don't think they extend all the
 
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
way to providing uh State funds to all
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
aspects of religious schools including
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh the requirement of chapel and
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
religious classes and that is Under The
 
01:12:33.790 --> 01:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
Establishment Clause that to answer your
 
01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:36.590 align:start position:0%
Establishment Clause that to answer your
question

01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
again uh are you you still have your
 
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
hand raised are you all
 
01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:47.480 align:start position:0%
set yeah I'm all set um I I had comments
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
on that but I I can't do that now okay
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:04.120 align:start position:0%

Mr Mr chair thank you Mr Barnes thank
 
01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
you sir Mr Barnes I have I have a
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
question for you if um we have a a
 
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
student uh in uh public education here
 
01:13:38.629 --> 01:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
in the state and off to go to a a school
 
01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
which is so-call private religious
 
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
school however the classes he or she
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
takes are mathematics and English
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
language arts that type of stuff and
 
01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:51.400 align:start position:0%
chemistry and there's no mention of
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
religion ideology at all uh do you
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
support well I think that the Supreme
 
01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
Court has uh in uh has has talked to uh
 
01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
spoken to that a number of in a number
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
of cases over the last hundred years and
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes I mean the court has made uh
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
findings in actually a case I litigated
 
01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
a long time ago um that that went up to
 
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
the court as uh Felton against agular um
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
which was overruled uh a number of years
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
later and did allow Title One funds
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
Federal Title One funds to be uh
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
provided to students in parochial
 
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
schools um but in the record of that
 
01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
case there is a lot of evidence of um
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
all of the religious schools and I was
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
at the depositions of I more more uh
 
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
Cardinals and and Bishops than I have
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
ever seen before uh and they all
 
01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
admitted that there were there were
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
crosses in the in the school buildings
 
01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
which they took down when the federal uh
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
inspectors came around they the students
 
01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
were required to take Chapel the
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
students were required to take uh
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
religious doct
 
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
classes um and uh I can't remember if
 
01:15:32.189 --> 01:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
they were required to take uh religious
 
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
history classes as well but they
 
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
certainly at least were uh en encouraged
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
to that was part of the curriculum would
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
be to uh basically steep a student in uh
 
01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
Catholic Doctrine and that's great uh my
 
01:15:53.830 --> 01:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
first wife was Catholic I I have
 
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
no uh problem with Catholic Doctrine
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
being available and taught uh if people
 
01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
want to send their children there just I
 
01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
don't think the state of New Hampshire
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
or any state or the federal government
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
should have to pay for it with our tax
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
dollars which already are not sufficient
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
to provide a fully adequate education to
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
students in the public schools and and
 
01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
the state has devolved a lot of the uh
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
funding for education in the public
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
schools to loc local uh municipalities
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
and uh towns so it's the local property
 
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayer not even the state that is
 
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
funding providing the funding that we
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
have for public education and we
 
01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take even $ one dollar away
 
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
from that thank you very much Mr Barn
 
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
bars excuse me are there further
 
01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.590 align:start position:0%
bars excuse me are there further
questions

01:16:46.590 --> 01:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:16:49.790 --> 01:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
yes any question yes um thank you for
 
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr barns um are you
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
aware that in uh public high schools
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
they do have uh classes that focus on
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
world I am aware that many high schools
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
do have classes on religion I believe
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
that they are uh not mandatory classes I
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
believe that they're offered as a choice
 
01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
for students and I would take the class
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
myself I I think uh it's it's great to
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
take it but um that is not the same as a
 
01:17:34.870 --> 01:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
religious school which uh is mandates
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
that the child goes to
 
01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
Chapel on a regular basis if not every
 
01:17:45.149 --> 01:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
day um that the the child takes
 
01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
mandatorily uh takes horses in religious
 
01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
Doctrine um to give me the choice of
 
01:17:57.910 --> 01:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
attending also a course that expands my
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
Horizon to uh many many different
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
religions around the world as you as you
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%

uh M Mr bars I'd ask have you ever had
 
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
any concern about secular Pro ing taking
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
place in public
 
01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
schools secular
 
01:18:31.990 --> 01:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
prizing no I'm not sure what you mean
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
sir I my my experience with Public
 
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
Schools both for myself and my uh
 
01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
teaching or speaking uh at schools with
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
with children who are students and also
 
01:18:52.390 --> 01:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
my son's education I uh don't have any
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
prizing you could clarify what you mean
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
I I I'll speak to
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
that uh well to to amplify my question
 
01:19:10.270 --> 01:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
Mr M I what I was picking up on is is a
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
concern of course about religious
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
schools uh and mandatory religious
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
classes which you you refer to and the
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
concern that that that some folks have
 
01:19:24.189 --> 01:19:24.199 align:start position:0%
is that in the public schools that there
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
are many examples of of Educators uh you
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
know speaking to values or promoting
 
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
values that are often in in conflict
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
with the values of the parents of the
 
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
students so uh again my my question
 
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
simply was uh I I understand your
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
concern about secular schools uh
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
promoting values and not being funded
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
for that reason and and thus my question
 
01:19:55.629 --> 01:19:55.639 align:start position:0%
question to you simply was uh are you
 
01:19:59.790 --> 01:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
similarly concerned about uh teachers or
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
Educators with captive
 
01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
audiences when I say prizing I mean you
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
know advocating or promoting certain
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
values uh in the public school uh venue
 
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm hearing that that's not a
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
concern of yours is that is that
 
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
correct uh well not that's not exactly
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
what I said uh first I said I don't know
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
about any body uh
 
01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
proing doing any secular prizing as in
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
demeaning religion or suggesting that
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
there's something wrong with people who
 
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
are very religious or partial somewhat
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
religious um I don't I don't have any
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
experience with that goes with that
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
going on but I certainly agree with you
 
01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
to answer your question I would be
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
concerned um if teachers were making
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
students feel like they shouldn't uh
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
celebrate their religion um uh my
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
experience actually is that the public
 
01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:03.639 align:start position:0%
schools have reached out and uh made
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
children feel good about uh exercising
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
their particular religious values they
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh invite uh my son's uh Jewish they
 
01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
invited him to uh bring a manora in
 
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
Hanukkah he's you know the one of two
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
Jewish kids in the class and and
 
01:21:27.629 --> 01:21:27.639 align:start position:0%
uh uh they invited him to present that
 
01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
student from other
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
religious backgrounds and the school
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
loves to loved to
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
share have the kids share their uh
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
traditions and and religions with uh the
 
01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
class so um I don't think there's any PR
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
what you call secular pral typ in going
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
on but if there were yes I would be
 
01:21:58.910 --> 01:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about it and the way you
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
framed it at the very end was whether
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about teachers with a
 
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
captive audience as you put it uh
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
promoting values um is uh I'm not sure
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
where you're going with that but
 
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
certainly uh teachers should not be
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
promoting any religious value and you
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
know the separation of church and state
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
is intended to be for or against
 
01:22:25.950 --> 01:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
religion it it's uh the state should not
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
promote Catholicism or protestantism or
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
Judaism or Buddhism or Islam the state
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
also should not promote uh atheism the
 
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
state should uh leave uh people to
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
exercise any religion they want to and
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
to not exercise any religion if they
 
01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
want to uh and in terms of teachers
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
teaching values promoting values I I
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
just have to point out that yes that is
 
01:23:01.149 --> 01:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
one of the purposes of public education
 
01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
is to teach values we want people the
 
01:23:07.709 --> 01:23:07.719 align:start position:0%
children as growing up in America to
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
learn to be good citizens to understand
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
democracy and and the right to vote and
 
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
um uh values like uh loving your fellow
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
men and women um we're all created in
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
God's image is something that is pretty
 
01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh much a value of of every religion I
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
know about and uh while it's not those
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
values are not promoted I don't think
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
should be promoted as a religious tenant
 
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
in schools the value of loving your
 
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
fellow human beings is something and
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
being part of the community uh what it
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
means what law means uh your rights and
 
01:23:53.669 --> 01:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
as well as your respons responsibilities
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
you have responsibilities to obey the
 
01:23:59.229 --> 01:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
law so there are a lot of values uh
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
democracy uh hope hopes to flourish uh
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
from our schools
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
uh uh teaching uh students to be members
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
of uh of our American
 
01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
Community thank you thank you very much
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%

bishop um I'm representing the bishop

I'm the director of public policy uh for
 
01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
the Roman Catholic dasis of Manchester
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
and it will come as no surprise to you
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
that I'm speaking today in support of
 
01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
cacr I I know it's been a long heing um
 
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
and representative cordelli and attorney
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
Smith have eloquently and and completely
 
01:26:55.229 --> 01:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
addressed the history and the legal
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
context in which this cacr comes up so I
 
01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go through all of that
 
01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:03.719 align:start position:0%
again I just want to uh mention two
 
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
things um first off um the uh the case
 
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
that representative Lynn talked about
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
that um wa state of Washington
 
01:27:17.669 --> 01:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
ministerial training case is a case
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
named lock versus
 
01:27:24.109 --> 01:27:24.119 align:start position:0%
Davey and that case was discussed in EP
 
01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
Espinosa and in fact it was put forward
 
01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
as a defense by the Montana Department
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
of Revenue in that case and the Supreme
 
01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
Court ruled that uh that that lock case
 
01:27:41.950 --> 01:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
did not apply in ESP Espinosa that the
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
real issue was and I'm gonna just read
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
the sentence here from the Espinosa
 
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
decision uh where the court said that
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
the no Aid provision by bars all Aid to
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
a religious
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
school simply because of what it
 
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
is um and so uh Espinosa again is really
 
01:28:06.270 --> 01:28:06.280 align:start position:0%
dispositive and I encourage everybody to
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
to read that case um the New Hampshire
 
01:28:12.189 --> 01:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
Blaine Amendment does exactly what the
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
Montana Blain Amendment did it bars all
 
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
Aid simply because of what the school is
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
and as Espinosa makes clear that
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
inescapably violates the uh free
 
01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:27.669 align:start position:0%
inescapably violates the uh free
exercise

01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
01:28:31.229 --> 01:28:31.239 align:start position:0%
clause now the second question um came
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
up earlier should this be repealed um
 
01:28:39.109 --> 01:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
and uh as a number of speakers have
 
01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh it it it absolutely should
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
first because it invites uh litigation
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
and the alternative is sort of caseby
 
01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
case litigation but I'd suggest that it
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
be repealed simply because it's the
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
right thing to do why would we leave it
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
in it's a relic of a different time in
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
the body politic and uh and in the
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
church too I'd add uh about a third of
 
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
the students in the diois and schools
 
01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.350 align:start position:0%
the students in the diois and schools
are

01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
non-catholic and I very much doubt that
 
01:29:19.390 --> 01:29:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
1877 um now to wrap up I guess I would
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
say that I know among all of us uh uh
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
that are participating in this hearing
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
today we have a lot of differing
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
opinions about whether it is advisable
 
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to provide public
 
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
funds to religious schools and how if at
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
all that should be done but that's not
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
the question here the question is
 
01:29:52.109 --> 01:29:52.119 align:start position:0%
whether there can be a categorical ban
 
01:29:53.669 --> 01:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
on that ever
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
happening and I'd respectfully uh
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
contend that the US Supreme Court has
 
01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
answered that question uh and so I'd ask
 
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
you to vote a to pass on this cacr and
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh considering our point
 
01:30:11.229 --> 01:30:11.239 align:start position:0%
of view and thank you for uh your
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
patience uh throughout this hearing I
 
01:30:17.950 --> 01:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
know if we were all at the lob uh again
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
this would be the time of year where
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
everybody's walking around very blur and
 
01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
and uh that is especially true in this
 
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh very unusual year so thank you for
 
01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
your patience and your
 
01:30:33.149 --> 01:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you very much uh Mr
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
D you got that parly right we're not
 
01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
walking around but we're sitting blurry
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
these so are there any questions from
 
01:30:45.149 --> 01:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
the committee here U Bob Dunn from the
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
arch dasis representative Woodcock
 
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock yes thank you Mr
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr D for taking this
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
question I just want to refer back to a
 
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
comment you made for some clarity you
 
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
indicated near the end of your um
 
01:31:01.550 --> 01:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
discussion that currently about onethird
 
01:31:04.149 --> 01:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
of the students in the dasas school are
 
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
are non uh Catholic uh my question
 
01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
following up to that is are are those
 
01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
students required to take courses and
 
01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
Catholicism and are they required to
 
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
attend chapels in those schools I
 
01:31:20.709 --> 01:31:20.719 align:start position:0%
believe that the answer to both of those
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
questions is no
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
um uh I will double check on that and if
 
01:31:27.109 --> 01:31:27.119 align:start position:0%
for some reason I have to correct that
 
01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
I'll let you know but I am uh virtually
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
positive that that it is the case that
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
they do not need to do those things
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr D thank you Mr chair are
 
01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
there further questions uh Mr D I have
 
01:31:43.870 --> 01:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
one that has maybe several questions
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
within uh first of all during this uh
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
pandemic that we're in has the arch
 
01:31:53.229 --> 01:31:53.239 align:start position:0%
dasis seen as an increased enrollment
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
within your school population and
 
01:31:57.990 --> 01:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
secondly are your high schools
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
accredited high schools and if so uh
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
what type of Standards do they meet the
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
same standards of regular public high
 
01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
schools or are your standards
 
01:32:13.109 --> 01:32:13.119 align:start position:0%
different um I think again um I I will I
 
01:32:15.109 --> 01:32:15.119 align:start position:0%
I don't really want to speculate I I'm
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
not the director of uh the schools but
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
um I believe that uh every single one of
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
the school schools is approved uh as a
 
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
private school by the New Hampshire
 
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
Education uh and that may well be
 
01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:33.400 align:start position:0%
another difference between the Catholic
 
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
schools of 2021 and the Catholic schools
 
01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:41.629 align:start position:0%
schools of 2021 and the Catholic schools
of

01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
1877 yes thank you thank you very much
 
01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
and what about your enrollment do you
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
have any understanding of the enrollment
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
question I asked whether oh yes I'm I'm
 
01:32:54.510 --> 01:32:54.520 align:start position:0%
sorry um yeah I I I don't know um I can
 
01:32:56.550 --> 01:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
get you that info I I know that the
 
01:32:59.109 --> 01:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
enrollment as of
 
01:33:02.550 --> 01:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
September was
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
um was a little over 5,300 students um
 
01:33:11.550 --> 01:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what it was in September of
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
the previous year so um I I I couldn't
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
tell you right now as I sit here uh
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
whether there was an increase or
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
how significant that increase was I
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
think that there was an
 
01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:31.830 align:start position:0%
think that there was an
increase

01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
than thank you very much Mr chair and
 
01:33:37.149 --> 01:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr dun for U um for
 
01:33:39.629 --> 01:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
testifying uh this morning just a quick
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
question um following up on on on what
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative lad was asking you in
 
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
terms of your schools compliance uh with
 
01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
with State um um public education requir
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
requirements I was just wondering if you
 
01:33:55.109 --> 01:33:55.119 align:start position:0%
could comment a little bit on compliance
 
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
with um federal and state statutes
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination yeah
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
I again I think our school person would
 
01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
probably know that a little better but I
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
I think I I I'm pretty confident in
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
saying that that we comply or our
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
schools comply with all of the
 
01:34:22.510 --> 01:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
applicable federal and state statutes
 
01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
um so uh I um you know I I'd really be
 
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
kind of going beyond my area of
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
Competency to talk about that in any
 
01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
detail so just just a followup on that
 
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
and um and if and if you could um
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
provide the the committee with with with
 
01:34:45.950 --> 01:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
you know this this information but
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
particularly particularly with respect
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
to special education and public schools
 
01:34:52.270 --> 01:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
requirement to provide a free and
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate um um uh public education to
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh to students with uh with
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for due process in place um
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh do do your schools currently provide
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
those services for I mean special
 
01:35:12.510 --> 01:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
education services with due
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
process what's your point of order uh my
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
my question my point of order is we're
 
01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
discussing cac3 and now we're very into
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh policies of special education in
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
Catholic schools I don't understand the
 
01:35:29.550 --> 01:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
connection between cac3 and that
 
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
question I I think where ref s luno is
 
01:35:35.709 --> 01:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
trying to lead to is that uh in regard
 
01:35:38.669 --> 01:35:38.679 align:start position:0%
to special education whether they're
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
they're providing that service or not
 
01:35:42.629 --> 01:35:42.639 align:start position:0%
providing that service I think that's as
 
01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
far as it should go yeah that that's
 
01:35:47.709 --> 01:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
that's all I'm trying to get at Mr CH I
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
can I can absolutely get uh answers to
 
01:35:54.030 --> 01:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
those questions um I would add though I
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
I want to underscore that um this is
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
exactly the sort of discussion that I
 
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
think would take place with respect to a
 
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
legislative determination about whether
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
um public benefits should be afforded to
 
01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
private or to religious schools um again
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
this the the Constitutional Amendment
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
and is is really around the question of
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
whether there is a categorical B that
 
01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
that can be in place so um I I don't
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
want to lose sight of that fact but I
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
will um I'll I'll I'll follow up um with
 
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
the answers to the those questions
 
01:36:36.189 --> 01:36:36.199 align:start position:0%
terrific thank you Mr dun thank you and
 
01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
could you follow up on this one too uh
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
back when we were dealing with SB 1993
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
several years ago it was uh communicated
 
01:36:47.950 --> 01:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
to us over in the governor's chamber
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%

diine high school is that correct in
 
01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
Manchester it is um and I'm looking at
 
01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:24.199 align:start position:0%
their course list and it says amongst
 
01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
required courses are theology intro to
 
01:37:29.870 --> 01:37:29.880 align:start position:0%

question just to assist uh Mr Dunn um in
 
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
the parent student handbook from Trinity
 
01:38:13.629 --> 01:38:13.639 align:start position:0%
High School there is uh a paragraph that
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
follows the mission statement and it's
 
01:38:21.790 --> 01:38:21.800 align:start position:0%
entitled the Catholic nature of Trinity
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
and it reads this uh non-catholic
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
students are welcome to attend Trinity
 
01:38:28.350 --> 01:38:28.360 align:start position:0%
High School with the understanding that
 
01:38:31.229 --> 01:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
all and that is underlined of our
 
01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:33.080 align:start position:0%

01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
religion classes prescribed by the
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%

particular bill I I mentioned at this

particular moment um but we do have uh
 
01:55:36.589 --> 01:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
three bills that I communicated with
 
01:55:39.790 --> 01:55:39.800 align:start position:0%

the first bill is going to be uh 257
 
01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:47.560 align:start position:0%
that's referencing political asy in
 
01:55:50.430 --> 01:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
schools and our call upon cordelli to
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
make a motion thank you Mr chairman uh I
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
would like to move that we uh retain
 
01:55:59.950 --> 01:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 257 prohibiting public
 
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:02.840 align:start position:0%

table to retain uh bill um 257 as
 
01:56:13.310 --> 01:56:13.320 align:start position:0%
political advocacy in schools M motion
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
made by represent cordelli and second by
 
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
represent Hobson Discerning discussion
 
01:56:22.109 --> 01:56:22.119 align:start position:0%
from either of the there's no
 
01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
discussion is there anyang hang
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
on yeah thank thanks Mr chair why
 
01:56:34.709 --> 01:56:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:40.109 --> 01:56:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
you the bill um has some positive intent
 
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
in regard to um
 
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh the issue that we talked a little bit
 
01:56:56.669 --> 01:56:56.679 align:start position:0%
about earlier uh in some of the other
 
01:56:56.679 --> 01:56:57.830 align:start position:0%
about earlier uh in some of the other
discussions

01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
01:57:02.589 --> 01:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
ccr3 my concern is that if we have it
 
01:57:04.830 --> 01:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
moveed Forward at this particular moment
 
01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
in the first year of the
 
01:57:09.870 --> 01:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
BM there's GNA be an offl discussion on
 
01:57:12.270 --> 01:57:12.280 align:start position:0%
the house floor and this bill could end
 
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
up taking us another hour an hour and a
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
half on the house floor and I don't know
 
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
if that's a priority of the education
 
01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:20.800 align:start position:0%
committee to have to be discussing that
 
01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
and probably that discussion will go
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
well beyond members of the education
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
committee okay Mr Mr chair I appreciate
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
that um but but uh I I don't see the
 
01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:35.639 align:start position:0%
positive any positive elements of this
 
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
bill so uh I would you know I I would
 
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
certainly put out there that that if I
 
01:57:44.109 --> 01:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
were to vote to retain it would not
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
because it would not be because I
 
01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
recognize anything positive about the
 
01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
bill but only to avoid um prolonged and
 
01:57:55.069 --> 01:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
unnecessary floor
 
01:57:57.790 --> 01:57:57.800 align:start position:0%
debate we we noticed a lot of confusing
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
language within that bill uh a lot of
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
these need
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
clarification uh and it's it's just not
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
ready to move forward I'm just very
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
concerned about what we're going to end
 
01:58:11.069 --> 01:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
up with when we get into the next
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
session this bill will just suck the air
 
01:58:15.310 --> 01:58:15.320 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
01:58:18.270 --> 01:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
room so with that if there's is there
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%

uh repr Miler was 215 and um I indicated
 
02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's a bill it's my bill one which
 
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:15.719 align:start position:0%
references School contracts with
 
02:00:18.270 --> 02:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
privates uh much of the language within
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
this is already in statute there's
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
already reference to Independent Schools
 
02:00:25.229 --> 02:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
and and in language and it deletes one
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
of the old terms which we have um I'll
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
get to that bill here and read that term
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
to you um I just don't believe the bill
 
02:00:40.229 --> 02:00:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:42.430 --> 02:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
hearing just trying to reach down get
 
02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:47.669 align:start position:0%
hearing just trying to reach down get
215

02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.750 --> 02:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
here okay the bill basically did any
 
02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
school district may make a contract with
 
02:00:55.069 --> 02:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
an academy that's already in law a high
 
02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
school that's in law I inserted in their
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
independent school that's already in law
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
elsewhere or other Private School
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
located in uh another state and raise
 
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
appropriate money to carry the contract
 
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:11.639 align:start position:0%
in effect um private was added in there
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
however we also have these Interstate
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
agreements already which are if there
 
02:01:18.310 --> 02:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
approved by the other state then it's
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's acceptable so I don't think that
 
02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
bill is needed I'm even I will make the
 
02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation that this bill be
 
02:01:30.510 --> 02:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
it is there a second second second okay
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%

next bill which I talked with M about

next bill which I talked with M about
was

02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:03:32.950 --> 02:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
um let's see HP
 
02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
speech uh this is a bill that we heard
 
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh was presented by representative
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
Alexander as as far as I'm concerned has
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
many fine considerations and points but
 
02:03:58.549 --> 02:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
however after hearing from Ron Rogers at
 
02:03:58.559 --> 02:03:59.430 align:start position:0%
however after hearing from Ron Rogers at
the

02:03:59.430 --> 02:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
University uh many of these issues have
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
been resolved and according to fire we
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
now have schools which have gone from
 
02:04:12.549 --> 02:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
red or yellow to Green uh all our state
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
schools and so um if there is anything
 
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
that has to be done in regard to this it
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be carefully thought out and
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
not done through a boiler plate type um
 
02:04:29.629 --> 02:04:29.639 align:start position:0%
act such as this so that's why um do we
 
02:04:31.790 --> 02:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
get a motion I'd like I'd like to
 
02:04:35.589 --> 02:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
recognize uh represent for a motion
 
02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would move that
 
02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
we retain House Bill
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
234 and represent Mett do you have I'll
 
02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
second that okay we have a motion made
 
02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
by represent cordelli and second by
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
repres reprentative Mett to retain uh
 
02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
this bill HP
 
02:04:57.549 --> 02:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
234 can you speak to your motion please
 
02:05:00.750 --> 02:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
than thank you Mr chairman uh yes I I
 
02:05:04.270 --> 02:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
think that there are uh some possible
 
02:05:08.830 --> 02:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
benefits to uh certain parts of this uh
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
bill um I also want to look more at the
 
02:05:16.589 --> 02:05:16.599 align:start position:0%
suggestions submitted by uh Shannon Reed
 
02:05:19.750 --> 02:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
of the community college system um with
 
02:05:22.109 --> 02:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
the suggested modifications that they
 
02:05:27.950 --> 02:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
make um so uh I am not ready to uh get
 
02:05:30.629 --> 02:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
rid of this bill entirely I I think that
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
um it uh could use more uh work and uh
 
02:05:39.669 --> 02:05:39.679 align:start position:0%
review uh before we uh have a different
 
02:05:42.189 --> 02:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
U motion on the
 
02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
bill is there further discussion
 
02:05:44.440 --> 02:05:46.430 align:start position:0%
bill is there further discussion
represent

02:05:46.430 --> 02:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:05:48.990 --> 02:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
Cornell I just there's so much much
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's already been done and that isn't
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
needed I I don't know why we wouldn't
 
02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
itl it and if somebody has more
 
02:05:59.669 --> 02:05:59.679 align:start position:0%
concerned bring up another bill that
 
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
concerns their what they have concerns
 
02:06:06.109 --> 02:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
with rather than just retain this bill
 
02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:09.679 align:start position:0%
that really most of it is unnecessary
 
02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
and with fire and and according to
 
02:06:16.069 --> 02:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
the people from the University and the
 
02:06:17.549 --> 02:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
community colleges have already been
 
02:06:20.589 --> 02:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
taken care of
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
Tanner uh thank you chair for taking my
 
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh comments this is the second at least
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
the second time since I've been on the
 
02:06:34.069 --> 02:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
education committee we've had this bill
 
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
we retained it in fact uh representative
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
mafin and I were on the committee the
 
02:06:41.629 --> 02:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
last time it was retained and you know
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
it it was a for me a simple matter of
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
getting the community college and the
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
university system together together with
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
the people that had a problem and
 
02:06:55.629 --> 02:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
resolved that problem and that's why now
 
02:06:58.990 --> 02:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
they have a green rating from fire um
 
02:07:00.390 --> 02:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
because the problems were brought
 
02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
forward and and corrected and I think
 
02:07:05.669 --> 02:07:05.679 align:start position:0%
that's the New Hampshire way rather than
 
02:07:09.350 --> 02:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
legislate um a bill that was obviously a
 
02:07:14.870 --> 02:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
a almost a a national Bill model um you
 
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
know in New Hampshire we sit down and
 
02:07:19.189 --> 02:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
and try to resolve things with without
 
02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
um a lot of laws hopefully and that's
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
why I would rather see this bill ited at
 
02:07:27.149 --> 02:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
this time thank
 
02:07:27.159 --> 02:07:30.229 align:start position:0%
this time thank
you

02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:33.589 --> 02:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
Le um thank you Mr chair I I understand
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
that a lot of progress has come forth
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
with previous bills on this issue
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
however one of the spee uh one of the
 
02:07:41.350 --> 02:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill was very recently
 
02:07:44.149 --> 02:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
on college campuses and saw a continued
 
02:07:46.109 --> 02:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
need for this I believe that we can
 
02:07:48.589 --> 02:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
improve this bill um and I believe that
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do for our college
 
02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
students is to retain this and come back
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
with something better next year because
 
02:07:55.950 --> 02:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
there are still opportunities for
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
improvement and this can be better
 
02:07:59.229 --> 02:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
fine-tuned so that we can address what
 
02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
still is an issue here in New Hampshire
 
02:08:03.390 --> 02:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
and congratulate our universities on
 
02:08:05.109 --> 02:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
what they've already done so
 
02:08:07.470 --> 02:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
well further
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
discussion yeah I would concur with the
 
02:08:13.870 --> 02:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh previous speakers we the the higher
 
02:08:16.549 --> 02:08:16.559 align:start position:0%
education has done a good job in
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
addressing the issues that came before
 
02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
this Committee in previous sessions and
 
02:08:24.030 --> 02:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
I think uh I think it telling this is
 
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
the appropriate thing it's a recognition
 
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
of the work that they have done
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding uh representative lon's
 
02:08:34.229 --> 02:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
concerns uh I think they've done a good
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
job and I think fire was very fire was
 
02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
the outside group that come came in was
 
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
very critical of how the institutions
 
02:08:43.910 --> 02:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
were working and for them to give their
 
02:08:45.870 --> 02:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
green light to this I think it's
 
02:08:47.950 --> 02:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
significant and that's why I think I
 
02:08:49.910 --> 02:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
this should be the itl did not retain
 
02:08:52.589 --> 02:08:52.599 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
02:08:55.709 --> 02:08:55.719 align:start position:0%
discussion represent bone thank you if
 
02:08:58.069 --> 02:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
we itl a bill then we can't bring it
 
02:09:00.430 --> 02:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
back next year but for retaining and
 
02:09:03.069 --> 02:09:03.079 align:start position:0%
with the co going on not that much being
 
02:09:05.549 --> 02:09:05.559 align:start position:0%
done on college campus so we don't know
 
02:09:08.589 --> 02:09:08.599 align:start position:0%
if they're gonna keep so I think by
 
02:09:08.599 --> 02:09:10.189 align:start position:0%
if they're gonna keep so I think by
retaining

02:09:10.189 --> 02:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
retaining
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
it we let the university system no we're
 
02:09:16.229 --> 02:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
still watching them and we'll see what
 
02:09:18.069 --> 02:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
happens next year so retaining I think
 
02:09:20.669 --> 02:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
is the best
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
motion thank you representative uh luno
 
02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair um I I I
 
02:09:29.310 --> 02:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
was actually gonna sort of jump on
 
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
exactly the same um point that
 
02:09:35.709 --> 02:09:35.719 align:start position:0%
representative B uh just made but I I
 
02:09:38.510 --> 02:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
think based on the comments from that
 
02:09:40.149 --> 02:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
that other people have heard with
 
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
regards to to the the significant amount
 
02:09:47.149 --> 02:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
of changes that would be required um uh
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
to somehow uh uh you know alter this
 
02:09:55.310 --> 02:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
bill to improve upon the work that the
 
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
um or build upon the work that the
 
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
university system community colleges
 
02:10:01.510 --> 02:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
have already done that would be an
 
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
entirely new bill and this bill could be
 
02:10:06.750 --> 02:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
itl and and a new bill could be
 
02:10:09.229 --> 02:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
reintroduced next year without uh
 
02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
without stepping on um stepping on this
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
so I I think support the itl uh don't
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
don't don't retain a a really a bad Bill
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
when uh when something new can can can
 
02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
completely be you know introduced uh
 
02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:26.790 align:start position:0%
completely be you know introduced uh
next

02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
next
 
02:10:30.430 --> 02:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
year okay uh it appears that there's
 
02:10:32.709 --> 02:10:32.719 align:start position:0%

education hardship and I'll call upon
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
chairman lad to introduce the bill uh
 
02:13:19.270 --> 02:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the record
 
02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
I I come from Hil New Hampshire and I'm
 
02:13:25.310 --> 02:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
here today we're just starting just
 
02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:26.470 align:start position:0%
here today we're just starting just
started

02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
started
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
hear I muted that was Miler okay and and
 
02:13:34.189 --> 02:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
I I'm here to speak on HB
 
02:13:38.750 --> 02:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
388 this bill is a bill that is uh been
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
heard many many many times in front of
 
02:13:43.229 --> 02:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
the education committee here and we
 
02:13:46.709 --> 02:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
started with this uh several years back
 
02:13:49.270 --> 02:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
and uh we're looking at this bill in
 
02:13:52.030 --> 02:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
terms of definitions and much of the
 
02:13:55.390 --> 02:13:55.400 align:start position:0%
language here um uh includes the two
 
02:13:57.990 --> 02:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
definitions that we had developed in
 
02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
previous years uh the best interest of
 
02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
student M find and manifest education
 
02:14:07.149 --> 02:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
hardship that is also defined but in
 
02:14:09.709 --> 02:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill we need to
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
understand both of these definitions
 
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
because it's a two-step process that we
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
have here for establishing a manifest
 
02:14:19.390 --> 02:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
education hardship manifest education
 
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
hardship is when there's a difficulty a
 
02:14:24.310 --> 02:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
difficult situation for a student the
 
02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
the student has that bottomline choice
 
02:14:29.629 --> 02:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
of working with Administration school
 
02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
boards Etc to have another placement
 
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
I'll get into that more thoroughly but
 
02:14:38.430 --> 02:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
to understand manifest education that
 
02:14:40.990 --> 02:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
definition needs to be looked at it's
 
02:14:44.709 --> 02:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
it's documented uh evidence or a
 
02:14:47.669 --> 02:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
condition that is either physical mental
 
02:14:47.679 --> 02:14:48.430 align:start position:0%
condition that is either physical mental
or

02:14:48.430 --> 02:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:14:51.270 --> 02:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
emotional and that a student may have
 
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
and how that is detrimental to and
 
02:14:56.430 --> 02:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
impacts the students academic
 
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
achievement and and and growth and such
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
condition must be severe pervasive or
 
02:15:06.549 --> 02:15:06.559 align:start position:0%
persistent so as to interfere with a or
 
02:15:08.069 --> 02:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
limit the ability of a student to
 
02:15:10.709 --> 02:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
receive an education so that's manifest
 
02:15:12.830 --> 02:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
education and the best interest of
 
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
student we we've identified in the past
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
discussions and work study groups that
 
02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
um there are occasions when a parent
 
02:15:22.750 --> 02:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
comes and says my child's having
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
difficulty in this school in this
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
present environment and it's not in his
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
best interest to remain in that
 
02:15:30.910 --> 02:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
particular assignment or
 
02:15:33.430 --> 02:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
placement so there's a process built in
 
02:15:35.709 --> 02:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
this uh legislation where parent can
 
02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
come and and speak directly with the
 
02:15:41.549 --> 02:15:41.559 align:start position:0%
superintendent and request uh uh that
 
02:15:45.149 --> 02:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
action be taken to assist their child um
 
02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
the superintendent receives that he must
 
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
respond with it 10 days of notice that
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
he's going to have this meeting with the
 
02:15:55.790 --> 02:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
parent and a decision is made if the
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
superintendent decides there is U
 
02:16:01.910 --> 02:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
evidence that this child needs
 
02:16:05.069 --> 02:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
uh and in the best interest the child a
 
02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
different placement or support provided
 
02:16:11.149 --> 02:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
he or she may do so by either
 
02:16:13.149 --> 02:16:13.159 align:start position:0%
transferring the student to another
 
02:16:15.750 --> 02:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
assignment within that school uh
 
02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
transfer to another school Within School
 
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
District or seek transfer outside the
 
02:16:24.750 --> 02:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
school district uh where this the
 
02:16:27.229 --> 02:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
student is not living to a nonresident
 
02:16:29.310 --> 02:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
school district that might be a public
 
02:16:32.030 --> 02:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
school academy or other approved school
 
02:16:34.830 --> 02:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
not in that District of residence that
 
02:16:37.429 --> 02:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
is a change that we from previous
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
discussions where it's before it's been
 
02:16:45.870 --> 02:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
um in in in another um let see how did
 
02:16:48.669 --> 02:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
we in another uh
 
02:16:50.349 --> 02:16:50.359 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to look through my many
 
02:16:54.509 --> 02:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
agenda here another SC
 
02:16:57.389 --> 02:16:57.399 align:start position:0%
in what we have inserted here is another
 
02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
approved school which means another
 
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
approved school which could be anywhere
 
02:17:07.230 --> 02:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
from a private school to a um a a public
 
02:17:09.790 --> 02:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
school uh
 
02:17:13.389 --> 02:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
so if in fact the parent uh does not
 
02:17:15.309 --> 02:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
like the decision of the the
 
02:17:18.349 --> 02:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
superintendent there's an appeal process
 
02:17:20.669 --> 02:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
um if the superintendent decides in the
 
02:17:23.629 --> 02:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
best interest there is a viable option
 
02:17:25.230 --> 02:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
and and should be pursued to put the
 
02:17:27.709 --> 02:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
child in another Resident District
 
02:17:30.270 --> 02:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
oftentimes in past years this has been
 
02:17:33.549 --> 02:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
done uh where school superintendent have
 
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
agreements between each other I know up
 
02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
in my neck of the woods Plymouth and
 
02:17:39.709 --> 02:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
hail did have an agreement where kids
 
02:17:41.509 --> 02:17:41.519 align:start position:0%
were placed from one school district to
 
02:17:44.070 --> 02:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
the other school district and the costs
 
02:17:46.030 --> 02:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
of that tuition were waved by both
 
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
superintendents because it went to two
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
ways Transportation though is the
 
02:17:52.349 --> 02:17:52.359 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the
 
02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
parent um if in fact the uh nothing is
 
02:17:57.950 --> 02:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
accomplished in the best interest of the
 
02:18:00.030 --> 02:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
student according to the parent the
 
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
parent has an option then to appeal that
 
02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
process and request a hearing with the
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
school board which has to occur after um
 
02:18:09.549 --> 02:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
a notification is provided within a
 
02:18:12.270 --> 02:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
15-day period of time and basically the
 
02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
same process occurs there where
 
02:18:16.270 --> 02:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
documented evidence is brought forward
 
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
and resolutions made by the school board
 
02:18:20.950 --> 02:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
as to whether they're going to
 
02:18:25.629 --> 02:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
CLI in another school uh or outside the
 
02:18:27.549 --> 02:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
district within the district
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
Etc um there are certain conditions that
 
02:18:34.270 --> 02:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
must be met before a a change of school
 
02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
assignment can be made subject to a the
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
parent petitions for change or consents
 
02:18:43.070 --> 02:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
to the superintendent's recommendation B
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
superintendent deter determines that
 
02:18:47.110 --> 02:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
this is in the best interest of the
 
02:18:50.030 --> 02:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
child see school board a Board of
 
02:18:52.830 --> 02:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
Trustees approved the sending school and
 
02:18:55.509 --> 02:18:55.519 align:start position:0%
the school board that they're within
 
02:18:58.190 --> 02:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
approves this as a receiving school does
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
not have to approve it that student do
 
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
not attend and there in this previous
 
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
law there's been a cap um of the number
 
02:19:08.349 --> 02:19:08.359 align:start position:0%
of kids which can leave a particular
 
02:19:10.669 --> 02:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
School District it's 1% of that
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment ADM enrollment and and and uh
 
02:19:19.629 --> 02:19:19.639 align:start position:0%
and 5% Max from a School within that
 
02:19:22.990 --> 02:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
District so that's basically where this
 
02:19:26.509 --> 02:19:26.519 align:start position:0%
bill is going now it's now change the
 
02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
legislation to re or other approved
 
02:19:32.190 --> 02:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
school not in the district or or
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
residents and and uh that provides an
 
02:19:37.950 --> 02:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
option to send the student to approve
 
02:19:40.309 --> 02:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
schools uh and there's a number we got
 
02:19:41.669 --> 02:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
in that discussion a little bit this
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
morning I'm not going to go there again
 
02:19:46.830 --> 02:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
right now um so um that concludes my
 
02:19:46.840 --> 02:19:48.190 align:start position:0%
right now um so um that concludes my
testimony

02:19:48.190 --> 02:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:19:51.550 --> 02:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm willing to take any questions
 
02:19:54.750 --> 02:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Miler thank
 
02:19:56.910 --> 02:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you uh
 
02:19:59.950 --> 02:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
representative lad so we've worked on
 
02:20:02.510 --> 02:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
the Manifest hardship over really the
 
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
last three sessions I've been in the
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
house here my understanding is that the
 
02:20:11.550 --> 02:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
language for the issuance of the
 
02:20:14.070 --> 02:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
Manifest hardship that's not in question
 
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
here the only thing that's in question
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
is what's in bold which deals with the
 
02:20:23.349 --> 02:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
approved school is that is that correct
 
02:20:23.359 --> 02:20:24.670 align:start position:0%
approved school is that is that correct
that's

02:20:24.670 --> 02:20:24.680 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:20:28.830 --> 02:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
correct um okay see you know just as
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
test I I might repr luno is is question
 
02:20:36.110 --> 02:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
okay I'll let representative luno ask
 
02:20:39.150 --> 02:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
the next question yeah so so
 
02:20:42.510 --> 02:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair and and um and
 
02:20:45.469 --> 02:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
representative Myer uh I I actually sort
 
02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
of had the same
 
02:20:49.510 --> 02:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
understanding of it that that you just
 
02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
laid out until I looked at the bill um a
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
little more closely and on on um line 11
 
02:21:02.349 --> 02:21:02.359 align:start position:0%
it talks about how RSA 193 colon 3 Roman
 
02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
1 through Roman three are repealed and
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
reenacted so that means that every all
 
02:21:11.910 --> 02:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
the text in here can be new text whether
 
02:21:14.670 --> 02:21:14.680 align:start position:0%
or not it's bolded or not and I'm not
 
02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
even sure what the Bold text means in
 
02:21:19.309 --> 02:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
here because if it's repealed and
 
02:21:22.750 --> 02:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
reenacted normally that comes through as
 
02:21:22.760 --> 02:21:24.270 align:start position:0%
reenacted normally that comes through as
straight

02:21:24.270 --> 02:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
straight
 
02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
um non-bolded text it's only when it's
 
02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
amended is it bolded text but I'm I'm I
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
just pulled up um 193 colon 3 and wow I
 
02:21:38.750 --> 02:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
mean we did a lot of work on this um two
 
02:21:44.349 --> 02:21:44.359 align:start position:0%
years ago and and I I I can't really say
 
02:21:48.630 --> 02:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
to what extent this change um totally
 
02:21:51.870 --> 02:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
upends the the existing content but this
 
02:21:55.309 --> 02:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
isn't this isn't minor tweaking
 
02:21:55.319 --> 02:22:00.830 align:start position:0%
isn't this isn't minor tweaking
um

02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:05.469 --> 02:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't so I I guess um um
 
02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
representative lad was this what you
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
do the okay the intent of this bill is
 
02:22:16.510 --> 02:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
try to put forward what we had um
 
02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:17.670 align:start position:0%
try to put forward what we had um
previously

02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
previously
 
02:22:19.710 --> 02:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
uh had resolution I believe there are
 
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
some changes to what we had previously
 
02:22:26.990 --> 02:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh it it just doesn't say another school
 
02:22:28.990 --> 02:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
it says An approved
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
school right but it doesn't even follow
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
the um I mean you can take take a look
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
at the current 193 colum 3 Roman 1
 
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
through Roman 3 and it's a it's a total
 
02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:44.150 align:start position:0%
through Roman 3 and it's a it's a total
rewrite

02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
rewrite
 
02:22:46.630 --> 02:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
um and even even the definition of
 
02:22:48.710 --> 02:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
manifest educational hardship is
 
02:22:50.469 --> 02:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
completely different from the definition
 
02:22:53.070 --> 02:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
that we all agree to I think in
 
02:22:57.429 --> 02:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
a wasn't it a a a really strong vote
 
02:22:59.230 --> 02:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
last two years
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
ago me that I don't think anything we've
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
ever done to this has been
 
02:23:07.630 --> 02:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
changed the definition for manifest
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
educational hardship is
 
02:23:14.110 --> 02:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
changed that that's exactly right we we
 
02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
have never when we first started working
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
on this and we came up with this
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
definition manifest education hardship
 
02:23:22.469 --> 02:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
working at that time with Barett
 
02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
Christina and I don't know if he signed
 
02:23:26.349 --> 02:23:26.359 align:start position:0%
up to talk here or not but we never put
 
02:23:29.630 --> 02:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
that into law yeah it it's it's it's in
 
02:23:32.429 --> 02:23:32.439 align:start position:0%
law it's in current law we did that two
 
02:23:35.070 --> 02:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
years ago not in the placement that it
 
02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
is right
 
02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
here definitions are now at the top here
 
02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.710 align:start position:0%
here definitions are now at the top here
as

02:23:41.710 --> 02:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
definitions I get that but it's a
 
02:23:45.910 --> 02:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
different definition I mean you and I
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
ago raised his hand is there a question
 
02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
here yeah I'm sorry I know this is sort
 
02:23:58.190 --> 02:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
of uh this is sort of getting at was was
 
02:24:00.389 --> 02:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
this what the what the what
 
02:24:02.910 --> 02:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative wad intended to put forth
 
02:24:05.309 --> 02:24:05.319 align:start position:0%
because it just looks very inconsistent
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
from what we what we did two years ago
 
02:24:12.990 --> 02:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
and even the the um the the the way it's
 
02:24:15.950 --> 02:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
bolded but it's repealed and reenacted
 
02:24:17.790 --> 02:24:17.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
02:24:21.870 --> 02:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
um it's very odd I I can respond to that
 
02:24:24.550 --> 02:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
and then I think bar might want to go
 
02:24:27.630 --> 02:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
forward I had about three or four
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
different eight house bills which dealt
 
02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
with manifest
 
02:24:34.030 --> 02:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
education and I don't I can't recall
 
02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
which one was submitted to um the
 
02:24:39.309 --> 02:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
legislative services to do this year my
 
02:24:44.110 --> 02:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
intent is that we had moved forward with
 
02:24:47.550 --> 02:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
a process uh last year and the year
 
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
before that and of course last year
 
02:24:53.389 --> 02:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
because the omnus bill uh we we uh it
 
02:24:56.309 --> 02:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
never I don't believe it made it then um
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
I do know that there's one process that
 
02:25:00.670 --> 02:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
I am concerned about is that there needs
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
to be a hearing process available and
 
02:25:05.070 --> 02:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
there I think this does speak to the
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
hearing process for a parent to have
 
02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
access uh if they're to an appeal
 
02:25:14.070 --> 02:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
process um on on the U to the state
 
02:25:16.510 --> 02:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
board but I believe that's already L and
 
02:25:20.230 --> 02:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
at this time I guess uh I'd like to
 
02:25:23.590 --> 02:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
suggest as person is presenting this
 
02:25:26.750 --> 02:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
that this is a bill that needs to move
 
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
forward uh whether this is the right
 
02:25:32.110 --> 02:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
version in front of
 
02:25:38.190 --> 02:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:41.230 --> 02:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I think you might want to
 
02:25:44.590 --> 02:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
re maybe re take a look at it and and
 
02:25:47.309 --> 02:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
schedule a new hearing on it um I think
 
02:25:49.269 --> 02:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
we can have a hearing and then of course
 
02:25:51.910 --> 02:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
that that's something that can be
 
02:25:55.550 --> 02:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
modified by by a work group you know
 
02:25:57.469 --> 02:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
it's I don't think we have to reschedule
 
02:26:00.550 --> 02:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
another hearing and there's a way around
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
this are there other questions um did I
 
02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
see representative
 
02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
wood thank you represent cordelli I I
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
had two the first one was representative
 
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
I mean luno answered that if this is not
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
the bill we're actually going to be
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
working on I don't know why we're having
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on it if the bulk of the
 
02:26:21.429 --> 02:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
language in the bill is not
 
02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
italicized um and we're just looking at
 
02:26:25.950 --> 02:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
that part the second part was was more
 
02:26:28.750 --> 02:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
specific uh so that was a question but
 
02:26:30.269 --> 02:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
representative lad appears to want to go
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
forward with the incorrect information
 
02:26:34.510 --> 02:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
the the second part
 
02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
was represent lad if this would um
 
02:26:43.790 --> 02:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
apparent requesting a change due to
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
manifest be uh reasonable if they
 
02:26:51.070 --> 02:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
believe that their school is only
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
teaching remotely and they want them in
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
in face-to-face learning or vice
 
02:27:00.190 --> 02:27:00.200 align:start position:0%
versa would that meet the definition
 
02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is just a totally new
 
02:27:06.110 --> 02:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
circumstance from where it was um I know
 
02:27:08.110 --> 02:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
that there was an amendment that came
 
02:27:10.750 --> 02:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
forward that represent luno and I put
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
together as I'm just trying to jog my
 
02:27:15.950 --> 02:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
memory here where we had put together a
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
supported that's where we need to be um
 
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
I would like very much to just you know
 
02:27:28.429 --> 02:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity here after we get
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
this thing introduced and that's all
 
02:27:32.990 --> 02:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing right now to the committee
 
02:27:36.469 --> 02:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
um to then uh bring forward and quite
 
02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
frankly I have not put much time into
 
02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
this at all uh it's something I recogn
 
02:27:43.950 --> 02:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
need to be put forward that that we we
 
02:27:48.389 --> 02:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
see as a priority um it needs to be done
 
02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
correctly I agree if there's any
 
02:27:53.309 --> 02:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
differences uh then we need to you know
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
settle those amongst ourselves it's a
 
02:27:57.630 --> 02:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
good candidate for a
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
study a further study together followup
 
02:28:03.469 --> 02:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
represent Celli yes just the
 
02:28:04.910 --> 02:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative L just the second part of
 
02:28:07.429 --> 02:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
the question um under the manifest
 
02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
definition on the document we have now
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
my question is would and I'm just asking
 
02:28:14.469 --> 02:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
Rick because I'm not sure where it would
 
02:28:17.269 --> 02:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
fall if a parent wants to contest or
 
02:28:20.070 --> 02:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
request a manifest because they not they
 
02:28:23.309 --> 02:28:23.319 align:start position:0%
don't believe the child is is learning
 
02:28:25.309 --> 02:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
in the remote they want to go to a
 
02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
school that has face to face or vice
 
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
versa would that be construed under this
 
02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
definition I don't think so and manifest
 
02:28:36.590 --> 02:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
education hardship is that second step
 
02:28:38.550 --> 02:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
which and if you read that carefully
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
that definition and that was a
 
02:28:45.230 --> 02:28:45.240 align:start position:0%
definition that was uh put forward by um
 
02:28:47.110 --> 02:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
all of us working Cooper
 
02:28:50.550 --> 02:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
together and it says uh in reading that
 
02:28:54.190 --> 02:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
such condition must be severe pervasive
 
02:28:56.910 --> 02:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
or persistent so as to interfere with or
 
02:28:59.349 --> 02:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
limit the ability of student receive
 
02:29:02.590 --> 02:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
education um and we're looking at the
 
02:29:04.670 --> 02:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
the physical the mental the emotional
 
02:29:07.590 --> 02:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
condition of the student um now
 
02:29:10.269 --> 02:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
obviously if a kid's not in school and
 
02:29:12.990 --> 02:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
if they're in a remote situation for
 
02:29:15.190 --> 02:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
example my own grandkids right now
 
02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
they've been out of school for two
 
02:29:20.110 --> 02:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
consecutive weeks without even being in
 
02:29:22.710 --> 02:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
the confines of the building now if that
 
02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
were to continue I could quite well
 
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
argue that that is a a severe impact to
 
02:29:33.870 --> 02:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
that child's growth and learning um so I
 
02:29:36.030 --> 02:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
I think that every Situation's a bit
 
02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
unique and that uh I think the
 
02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
definition that we we struggled to
 
02:29:43.309 --> 02:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
develop here and this is the
 
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
definition that I believe that working
 
02:29:48.910 --> 02:29:48.920 align:start position:0%
with the school boards Association who
 
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
came up with uh and we all concurred
 
02:29:56.469 --> 02:29:56.479 align:start position:0%
to uh please inform me that it's not and
 
02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
and U but and to interpret this this
 
02:30:02.190 --> 02:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
goes all the way back to the Lisbon case
 
02:30:04.990 --> 02:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
years and years ago where an individual
 
02:30:06.750 --> 02:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
was looking to find a school that can
 
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
provide the academic program they wanted
 
02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
it may not have been offer know that's
 
02:30:13.630 --> 02:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
not a manifest education
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
AR that's
 
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
Mullen thank you representative cordelli
 
02:30:27.429 --> 02:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
I didn't expect you to go to me so
 
02:30:30.389 --> 02:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
quickly um in that definition of
 
02:30:34.190 --> 02:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
manifest hardship representative vad uh
 
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
the word so is critical because in the
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
definition that we adopted and went into
 
02:30:44.910 --> 02:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
effect September 27th of
 
02:30:48.870 --> 02:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
2020 the definition says that the the
 
02:30:51.870 --> 02:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
condition must be so
 
02:30:55.630 --> 02:30:55.640 align:start position:0%
severe that it negatively impacts blah
 
02:30:56.950 --> 02:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah blah through the rest of
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
the definition in the current definition
 
02:31:03.469 --> 02:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
of the bill that you proposed the so
 
02:31:07.389 --> 02:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
moves from so severe to the position
 
02:31:11.349 --> 02:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
where it is uh it has to be present so
 
02:31:15.150 --> 02:31:15.160 align:start position:0%
as to influence so in my mind the
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
difference there is that if something is
 
02:31:17.520 --> 02:31:18.870 align:start position:0%
difference there is that if something is
so

02:31:18.870 --> 02:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:21.790 --> 02:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
severe it sort of highlights the degree
 
02:31:25.950 --> 02:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
of impact but if it is so as to
 
02:31:29.110 --> 02:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
influence then that's a lower standard
 
02:31:31.870 --> 02:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
at least that's how I read it I can
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
respond to that when when our our folks
 
02:31:36.349 --> 02:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
over in legislative services are writing
 
02:31:38.990 --> 02:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
bills for us uh
 
02:31:41.750 --> 02:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes a little word like so can be
 
02:31:45.590 --> 02:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
moved around and that really impacts um
 
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
and when you put a word like so in front
 
02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
Okay now try to Define so where is that
 
02:31:54.429 --> 02:31:54.439 align:start position:0%
boundary where's that Line in the Sand I
 
02:31:58.790 --> 02:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
don't and so it's I I think it such
 
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
condition must be severe pervasive or
 
02:32:04.950 --> 02:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
persistent so as to interfere um right
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
but that's quite different than so
 
02:32:10.750 --> 02:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
severe that it impacts the performance
 
02:32:14.030 --> 02:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
of one has kind of a superlative nature
 
02:32:17.230 --> 02:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
to it well respond to that we're getting
 
02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
into lawyer talk right now and and that
 
02:32:22.389 --> 02:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
you know reasonable unreasonable you
 
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
know all these I totally I I do not uh
 
02:32:28.190 --> 02:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
for a minute representative lad think
 
02:32:31.469 --> 02:32:31.479 align:start position:0%
that somehow or Another You plotted this
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
positioning of the word so but I do but
 
02:32:37.150 --> 02:32:37.160 align:start position:0%
I do think that it was part of part of
 
02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
that was the discussion last time around
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
was so robust because we were looking at
 
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
things like
 
02:32:46.750 --> 02:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
that so
 
02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh if we need to change that so so
 
02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:51.950 align:start position:0%
uh if we need to change that so so
change

02:32:51.950 --> 02:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
it work I just feel that we need to have
 
02:32:58.349 --> 02:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
a process that's more definitive than
 
02:33:01.230 --> 02:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
what we have in statute right now uh
 
02:33:03.950 --> 02:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
this process of math education came out
 
02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
of years and years ago with No Child
 
02:33:08.110 --> 02:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
Left Behind that's where all emanated
 
02:33:11.190 --> 02:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
from and the initial wording that we had
 
02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
came out of uh Cambridge
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and and we have modified
 
02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
it over the years of our having
 
02:33:21.349 --> 02:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
discussions uh what I I would like to be
 
02:33:23.469 --> 02:33:23.479 align:start position:0%
able to do is find out where that
 
02:33:26.510 --> 02:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
wording is that we had the maybe the
 
02:33:30.830 --> 02:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
luno laad lad luno and and and to get it
 
02:33:32.990 --> 02:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
in there and and move this thing for
 
02:33:36.389 --> 02:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's my only de it's in statute
 
02:33:39.429 --> 02:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
so it won't be hard to find it yeah it's
 
02:33:39.439 --> 02:33:41.389 align:start position:0%
so it won't be hard to find it yeah it's
okay

02:33:41.389 --> 02:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:33:44.469 --> 02:33:44.479 align:start position:0%
um yeah so just to clarify
 
02:33:48.550 --> 02:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
this uh represent Vlad your intent from
 
02:33:51.429 --> 02:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
what I understand what you're saying is
 
02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
not to change what was agreed to last
 
02:33:59.670 --> 02:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
time and as in current law your intent
 
02:34:03.349 --> 02:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
of this language was to merely add the
 
02:34:06.950 --> 02:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
boldfaced items that are in that are in
 
02:34:11.790 --> 02:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:14.990 --> 02:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
correct the intent that I had was to try
 
02:34:17.309 --> 02:34:17.319 align:start position:0%
and move forward the language that we
 
02:34:20.190 --> 02:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
had discussed now I'm looking at what we
 
02:34:22.910 --> 02:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
have here from legislative Services when
 
02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
I was looking at this briefly after
 
02:34:26.750 --> 02:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
taking the kids to basketball practice
 
02:34:29.269 --> 02:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
last night or game up in St J at about
 
02:34:32.670 --> 02:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
9:30 and 10 o'clock at night I I you
 
02:34:34.830 --> 02:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
know quite frankly I looked at all the
 
02:34:37.830 --> 02:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
different bills we had plus this one and
 
02:34:41.469 --> 02:34:41.479 align:start position:0%
it would became confusing okay
 
02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
so that we have a manifest education AR
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
bill that uh
 
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
reflects what we had worked on and I
 
02:34:51.830 --> 02:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
don't know now if we're going back one
 
02:34:54.150 --> 02:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
or two or even possibly a little over
 
02:34:57.110 --> 02:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
two years we've been on this thing I
 
02:34:59.670 --> 02:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
just want to put it there okay so so uh
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
just for clarification then my
 
02:35:04.349 --> 02:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
understanding then is that prior to
 
02:35:07.469 --> 02:35:07.479 align:start position:0%
moving to executing this particular bill
 
02:35:09.389 --> 02:35:09.399 align:start position:0%
that there will be further
 
02:35:12.030 --> 02:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
conversations uh in the interim to try
 
02:35:15.469 --> 02:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
to clarify exactly where the current
 
02:35:18.349 --> 02:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
statute is in relationship to this
 
02:35:21.389 --> 02:35:21.399 align:start position:0%
particular proposal is that correct
 
02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's correct I okay thank you we put
 
02:35:26.469 --> 02:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
some the the stuff in there okay thank
 
02:35:30.550 --> 02:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
you respond to you Mel I'm not satisfied
 
02:35:34.389 --> 02:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
for putting a definition mixed into the
 
02:35:38.269 --> 02:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
bill itself into the content I'd like to
 
02:35:40.910 --> 02:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
see a definition that we have in there
 
02:35:43.150 --> 02:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
right now moved underneath definitions
 
02:35:46.110 --> 02:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
so it can be quickly found and taking
 
02:35:48.790 --> 02:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
what we had in that original Bill the
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
one that that the Luna lad had and we
 
02:35:54.070 --> 02:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
talked about manifest education but it
 
02:35:56.550 --> 02:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
embedded I would just prefer to see take
 
02:35:58.269 --> 02:35:58.279 align:start position:0%
that little poop out and put it
 
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
underneath a SE say definitions so it
 
02:36:03.630 --> 02:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
can quickly be found I'm not looking at
 
02:36:05.429 --> 02:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
changing content at
 
02:36:09.950 --> 02:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
all point of order um yes point of order
 
02:36:11.630 --> 02:36:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank thank you very much representative
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair and uh representative lad um
 
02:36:16.590 --> 02:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
the reason I'm calling a point order on
 
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
this is is because I I don't think what
 
02:36:21.469 --> 02:36:21.479 align:start position:0%
we've got in front of us is anywhere
 
02:36:24.389 --> 02:36:24.399 align:start position:0%
close to what to what representative lad
 
02:36:27.150 --> 02:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
intended in fact even in representative
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
lad's um remarks introducing the bill he
 
02:36:31.870 --> 02:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
talked about the importance of having an
 
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
appeals uh process through the State
 
02:36:37.670 --> 02:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
Board which exists in EX in in current
 
02:36:41.710 --> 02:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
law because of the the lad luno U bill
 
02:36:44.790 --> 02:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
that went into effect two years ago this
 
02:36:48.190 --> 02:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
bill takes that out out so I I I mean so
 
02:36:51.550 --> 02:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
just at the simplest levels um it's it's
 
02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
missing critical components and and
 
02:36:56.190 --> 02:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
representative lad I mean I think all of
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
us on the education committee uh two
 
02:37:01.349 --> 02:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
years ago remembers that hearing it was
 
02:37:04.950 --> 02:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
one of the best hearings we had um uh
 
02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
with very robust discussion um people
 
02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
were were were really involved in
 
02:37:15.309 --> 02:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
putting forth a um really solid piece of
 
02:37:17.550 --> 02:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
policy having worked on it for a long
 
02:37:20.830 --> 02:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
time and um and I you know I I I just
 
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to be able to
 
02:37:26.230 --> 02:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
have a hearing on on on that given the
 
02:37:28.910 --> 02:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
um given that th this I think is just
 
02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:30.309 align:start position:0%
um given that th this I think is just
really

02:37:30.309 --> 02:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:37:33.870 --> 02:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm I'm there's a lot of
 
02:37:37.030 --> 02:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
bills and I know think sorry about
 
02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:39.429 align:start position:0%
bills and I know think sorry about
that

02:37:39.429 --> 02:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:37:42.110 --> 02:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
um but I think we may want to just sort
 
02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
of get
 
02:37:48.110 --> 02:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
this get this amend ended and conduct a
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
a a new hearing on it so that we can
 
02:37:53.590 --> 02:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
have that same sort of robust um
 
02:37:55.550 --> 02:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
testimony and participation that we had
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
two years ago are there other questions
 
02:38:00.790 --> 02:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
from the committee Linda Tanner has her
 
02:38:04.429 --> 02:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:09.590 --> 02:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
and um thank you I I totally agree with
 
02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
uh both representative Miler and
 
02:38:15.150 --> 02:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
representative luno that um we need to
 
02:38:18.830 --> 02:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
you know revisit this um knowing the
 
02:38:21.269 --> 02:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
things that we do know my initial
 
02:38:25.710 --> 02:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
question was simply uh about the the
 
02:38:29.110 --> 02:38:29.120 align:start position:0%
bold face and that was uh when it says
 
02:38:30.830 --> 02:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
other approved schools not in the
 
02:38:32.030 --> 02:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
district of
 
02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
residence um we have schools approved
 
02:38:39.630 --> 02:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
for tuition purposes schools approved
 
02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
for uh attendance
 
02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
purposes um we have schools that may be
 
02:38:48.030 --> 02:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
approved under a learn
 
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere um and we might have schools
 
02:38:55.269 --> 02:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh in Canada just across the border or
 
02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
um schools in another state is that is
 
02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
that what you're opening this up
 
02:39:03.950 --> 02:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
to is that your
 
02:39:07.870 --> 02:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
intent is that a question to me yes um
 
02:39:10.870 --> 02:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
yes you're the even thought i' been
 
02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
opening this up to a school in
 
02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:14.469 align:start position:0%
opening this up to a school in
Canada

02:39:14.469 --> 02:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
Canada
 
02:39:16.429 --> 02:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
um um
 
02:39:18.190 --> 02:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's
 
02:39:21.910 --> 02:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
a I'm looking at
 
02:39:25.469 --> 02:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
uh the word it says before in another
 
02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
District or other approved school not in
 
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
the district I have there right now of
 
02:39:34.150 --> 02:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
residents so it really opens it up to
 
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
being able to place a child in another
 
02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
school it could be public or private
 
02:39:40.590 --> 02:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
that's how I see
 
02:39:43.269 --> 02:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
that right but it's an approved school
 
02:39:45.150 --> 02:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
and what I'm saying is under the doe
 
02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:46.309 align:start position:0%
and what I'm saying is under the doe
laws

02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
laws
 
02:39:49.190 --> 02:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
there's approved schools for tuition uh
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
approved schools for attendance and
 
02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
because it's another school it simply
 
02:39:56.990 --> 02:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
says another approved school not in the
 
02:39:59.750 --> 02:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
district of residence could that be for
 
02:40:03.070 --> 02:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
example if you were in the top part of
 
02:40:04.590 --> 02:40:04.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and you wanted to go to
 
02:40:07.590 --> 02:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
Canada could you put your student there
 
02:40:10.190 --> 02:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
um Switzerland maybe if you wanted to do
 
02:40:14.190 --> 02:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
there or uh could you choose California
 
02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
or you know um it seems to be really too
 
02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
wide open for me but um I was wondering
 
02:40:23.630 --> 02:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
if that was your intent or that was
 
02:40:25.950 --> 02:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
something an unintended consequence of
 
02:40:28.349 --> 02:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
that approved School means approved by
 
02:40:30.750 --> 02:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
the department or approved locally by
 
02:40:33.630 --> 02:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
your local school board uh for if you're
 
02:40:36.750 --> 02:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
a tuition program uh school which we
 
02:40:39.429 --> 02:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
already have in law so it's referencing
 
02:40:43.630 --> 02:40:43.640 align:start position:0%
approved as we have in current statute
 
02:40:46.190 --> 02:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh so we have no no approve approval for
 
02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
schools that are in Switzerland or or
 
02:40:54.230 --> 02:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
for mod Academy in uh Saxon Ser Vermont
 
02:40:57.150 --> 02:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
or whatever uh unless Vermont Academy
 
02:40:59.750 --> 02:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
happens to be approved by Mount ker then
 
02:41:02.510 --> 02:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
I imagine that might be but that would
 
02:41:05.590 --> 02:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
only be applicable to Vermont or me um
 
02:41:09.469 --> 02:41:09.479 align:start position:0%
just as a followup on that um if I could
 
02:41:11.790 --> 02:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
um what about the learn everywhere
 
02:41:14.790 --> 02:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
program where uh approval for programs
 
02:41:18.550 --> 02:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
there uh might include a
 
02:41:20.950 --> 02:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
school learn everywhere program is
 
02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
approved by the State Board of Education
 
02:41:26.349 --> 02:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
that's not approved by your um your
 
02:41:28.830 --> 02:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
local board but uh that would lead to
 
02:41:30.309 --> 02:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
credit for
 
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
graduation I I don't think that that's a
 
02:41:36.190 --> 02:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
that's a program available for specific
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
courses it's not a school it's not
 
02:41:43.070 --> 02:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
designed to be a full run School Al it's
 
02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
an alternative program so I don't think
 
02:41:47.790 --> 02:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
that even relates to this we're talking
 
02:41:50.030 --> 02:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
about a free school learn everywhere
 
02:41:51.389 --> 02:41:51.399 align:start position:0%
program is not a
 
02:41:59.870 --> 02:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:05.309 --> 02:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
lakus yeah yes I was looking back at uh
 
02:42:09.030 --> 02:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:13.309 --> 02:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
1282 um which we took to interim study
 
02:42:16.190 --> 02:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
we had I haven't gone through the whole
 
02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
things that we did last year so this uh
 
02:42:23.790 --> 02:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
wording was based on that but yes we did
 
02:42:26.830 --> 02:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
go and we worked with Barett Christina
 
02:42:28.870 --> 02:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
and we all worked together and we came
 
02:42:31.070 --> 02:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
up with something wonderful it did and
 
02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
we passed it but it never went into law
 
02:42:37.870 --> 02:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
because it got put into a big one of
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
those big bills and got defeated so it
 
02:42:42.790 --> 02:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
is not current law so what we need to do
 
02:42:45.750 --> 02:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
is find and that's why you're finding
 
02:42:47.269 --> 02:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
such a difference when you're looking up
 
02:42:48.790 --> 02:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
what's in current law and it doesn't
 
02:42:51.510 --> 02:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
look like this it's because it didn't
 
02:42:54.190 --> 02:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
end up in current law it we all agreed
 
02:42:56.750 --> 02:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
but it never um made it all the
 
02:42:59.429 --> 02:42:59.439 align:start position:0%
way it went to the Senate got put in a
 
02:43:02.830 --> 02:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
Big omnus Bill got to and that got
 
02:43:05.950 --> 02:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
defeated and so it's not lost so we are
 
02:43:07.710 --> 02:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
still back to where we were and what we
 
02:43:10.950 --> 02:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
need to find is which I have not found
 
02:43:15.349 --> 02:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
yet I'm still looking a copy of uh the
 
02:43:17.630 --> 02:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
agement what we finally ended up with
 
02:43:19.990 --> 02:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
with baric Christina and everybody
 
02:43:22.070 --> 02:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
working on it together and start from
 
02:43:24.710 --> 02:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
there and I think that was the intent
 
02:43:27.269 --> 02:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
was to do that plus but just add these
 
02:43:29.429 --> 02:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
approved schools I looked at this
 
02:43:31.870 --> 02:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
wording and this wording is the
 
02:43:36.349 --> 02:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
same as uh 1282 which is what we started
 
02:43:39.070 --> 02:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
with and I don't I haven't yet found the
 
02:43:41.269 --> 02:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
wording that we ended up with I'm still
 
02:43:43.670 --> 02:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
looking for it was there a further
 
02:43:46.630 --> 02:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
question representative no I just wanted
 
02:43:52.550 --> 02:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
to um explain because that seems to be
 
02:43:56.389 --> 02:43:56.399 align:start position:0%
what the confusion is um a point of
 
02:43:59.950 --> 02:43:59.960 align:start position:0%
order yes repr luno yeah so the Manifest
 
02:44:02.510 --> 02:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
education hardship bill from from last
 
02:44:05.429 --> 02:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
session made it into house bill 1558
 
02:44:06.990 --> 02:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
which is the Omnibus Bill that was
 
02:44:11.150 --> 02:44:11.160 align:start position:0%
drafted in the Senate and it was um um
 
02:44:15.510 --> 02:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
it was um passed uh I believe on our our
 
02:44:19.750 --> 02:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
last session day and signed by the
 
02:44:24.309 --> 02:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
governor um I can give you the date on
 
02:44:26.950 --> 02:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
that signed by the governor I think it
 
02:44:32.030 --> 02:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
looks like um on um July 29th so it is
 
02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:33.590 align:start position:0%
looks like um on um July 29th so it is

I'm not I'm not sure where I can go with
 
02:45:26.030 --> 02:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
that now um indeed we made comprehensive
 
02:45:27.750 --> 02:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
changes to the Manifest educational
 
02:45:31.030 --> 02:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
hardship statute RSA 193 col 3 last
 
02:45:33.870 --> 02:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
years um representative luno mentioned
 
02:45:35.670 --> 02:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
it was House Bill
 
02:45:38.990 --> 02:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
1328 that bill um passed this committee
 
02:45:41.950 --> 02:45:41.960 align:start position:0%
unanimously the vote was 18 to zero um
 
02:45:44.269 --> 02:45:44.279 align:start position:0%
it then moved to the Senate um where
 
02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
obviously got held up due to to covid
 
02:45:49.550 --> 02:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
and and all that sort of stuff but um as
 
02:45:51.550 --> 02:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
as representative luno did mention it
 
02:45:53.870 --> 02:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
was embedded or included in House Bill
 
02:45:57.870 --> 02:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
1558 the Omnibus Bill if you go to RSA
 
02:46:02.309 --> 02:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
1933 on online you'll see um that the
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
the date of Effectiveness or the
 
02:46:08.630 --> 02:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
effective date um was September 27th
 
02:46:11.550 --> 02:46:11.560 align:start position:0%
2020 so
 
02:46:14.590 --> 02:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
uh presuming that this is the bill um
 
02:46:16.469 --> 02:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
that that was intended to be put forward
 
02:46:18.070 --> 02:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
this is a language that was intended to
 
02:46:22.550 --> 02:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
be um put forward um and hsba um um
 
02:46:25.550 --> 02:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
would oppose this uh we spent probably
 
02:46:27.269 --> 02:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
three or four years as representative
 
02:46:29.469 --> 02:46:29.479 align:start position:0%
lad um spent working on manifest
 
02:46:31.510 --> 02:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
educational hardship I believe it was
 
02:46:34.710 --> 02:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
two years ago there was a lad lumo luno
 
02:46:37.110 --> 02:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
either bill or amendment that we thought
 
02:46:38.830 --> 02:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
we had gotten through and it was in the
 
02:46:40.510 --> 02:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
Senate and I think we found some
 
02:46:43.110 --> 02:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
language that was either contradictory
 
02:46:45.150 --> 02:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
to one another or or changeed some of
 
02:46:47.590 --> 02:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
the intent of the statute so that's the
 
02:46:49.790 --> 02:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
that's the version that died I believe
 
02:46:52.590 --> 02:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
um two sessions ago but last year we
 
02:46:55.349 --> 02:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
made significant changes um I thought we
 
02:46:57.950 --> 02:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
were good with it it was unanimous um we
 
02:46:59.870 --> 02:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
had good conversations within the
 
02:47:02.710 --> 02:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
committee we in included a uh a
 
02:47:04.830 --> 02:47:04.840 align:start position:0%
definition of a manifest educational
 
02:47:07.950 --> 02:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
hardship um to help parents sort of
 
02:47:09.670 --> 02:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
navigate the system and understand what
 
02:47:11.830 --> 02:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
it is and as well to provide some
 
02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
clarity and guidance to to school boards
 
02:47:16.190 --> 02:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
and superintend and and the State Board
 
02:47:21.349 --> 02:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
of Education as well too um I I one of
 
02:47:25.190 --> 02:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
the concerns um that nsba has with the
 
02:47:28.389 --> 02:47:28.399 align:start position:0%
the the the the proposed language um the
 
02:47:30.349 --> 02:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
definition of manifest educational
 
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
hardship in the bill on page one lines 6
 
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
through1 is is different than what's in
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
current law um uh you know the the as I
 
02:47:43.349 --> 02:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
believe it was um representative Mullen
 
02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
you brought up the place of the of the W
 
02:47:47.910 --> 02:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
so the other significant change is the
 
02:47:50.950 --> 02:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
current language um for the current
 
02:47:52.830 --> 02:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
definition of a manifest educational
 
02:47:56.870 --> 02:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
hardship means a student means that a
 
02:47:59.830 --> 02:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
student has a documented hardship in his
 
02:48:02.990 --> 02:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
or her current educational placement and
 
02:48:05.830 --> 02:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
that such hardship has has a detrimental
 
02:48:07.670 --> 02:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
or negative impact on the students
 
02:48:10.630 --> 02:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
academic achievement or growth physical
 
02:48:12.389 --> 02:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
safety or social and emotional
 
02:48:15.190 --> 02:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
well-being the hardship must be so
 
02:48:17.070 --> 02:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
pervasive and persistent that it
 
02:48:18.790 --> 02:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
interferes with or limits the ability of
 
02:48:22.030 --> 02:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
the student to receive an education um
 
02:48:25.950 --> 02:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
this definition on line seven um where
 
02:48:27.710 --> 02:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
it says that the documented physical
 
02:48:29.590 --> 02:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
mental or emotional condition is brought
 
02:48:32.309 --> 02:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
on by his or her current educational
 
02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
placement that's a significant shift
 
02:48:36.389 --> 02:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
from what the pre the current definition
 
02:48:39.190 --> 02:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
stands for that definition in the in the
 
02:48:41.070 --> 02:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
bill seems to be blaming the public
 
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
schools um for the Manifest educational
 
02:48:45.710 --> 02:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
hardship and we know that that's not
 
02:48:48.710 --> 02:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely not the case um some of these
 
02:48:50.670 --> 02:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
are are some of the Manifest educational
 
02:48:52.349 --> 02:48:52.359 align:start position:0%
hardship cases deal with
 
02:48:54.190 --> 02:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
Transportation um which is not the
 
02:48:56.349 --> 02:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
school's fault um some of them deal with
 
02:48:58.190 --> 02:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
family circumstances which is certainly
 
02:49:00.830 --> 02:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
not the school's fault uh the other
 
02:49:03.429 --> 02:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
problem with um going through the bill
 
02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
where where it's you know approved
 
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
School approved school um that seems to
 
02:49:10.630 --> 02:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
be the gist of the of of of the change
 
02:49:12.750 --> 02:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
to open up manifest educational hardship
 
02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
where the parent can apply a request to
 
02:49:17.830 --> 02:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
send their kid to a private school um
 
02:49:19.510 --> 02:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
that was not the conversation that we
 
02:49:21.990 --> 02:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
had last year when it came out of this
 
02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:22.870 align:start position:0%
had last year when it came out of this
committee

02:49:22.870 --> 02:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:49:26.830 --> 02:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
unanimously um we purposely intended to
 
02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
keep this and I say we I mean
 
02:49:31.349 --> 02:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
collectively nhba all the stakeholders
 
02:49:33.550 --> 02:49:33.560 align:start position:0%
and this committee purposely decided to
 
02:49:35.269 --> 02:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
keep manifest educational hardship
 
02:49:37.469 --> 02:49:37.479 align:start position:0%
within the public school realm when we
 
02:49:39.389 --> 02:49:39.399 align:start position:0%
had a bill I believe it was two or three
 
02:49:41.830 --> 02:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
years ago um representative lad when you
 
02:49:43.469 --> 02:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
first introduced the changes to the
 
02:49:45.590 --> 02:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
Manifest educational hard ship statute I
 
02:49:48.870 --> 02:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
believe in 2017 or 2018 sir I remember
 
02:49:50.190 --> 02:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
you sitting in that chair and you saying
 
02:49:51.389 --> 02:49:51.399 align:start position:0%
this is not intended to be a school
 
02:49:53.510 --> 02:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
choice bill this is intended to provide
 
02:49:55.750 --> 02:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
clarification to the to the current
 
02:49:58.030 --> 02:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
system and provide definitions and help
 
02:50:00.510 --> 02:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
clean up the process so parents can have
 
02:50:02.670 --> 02:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
a better understanding of what it is and
 
02:50:04.950 --> 02:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
the bill last year House Bill 1328
 
02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
embedded in 1558 does that the other
 
02:50:10.910 --> 02:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
logistical problem with the bill um I'm
 
02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:13.640 align:start position:0%
jumping to page
 
02:50:16.950 --> 02:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
three on line 11 where it talks about
 
02:50:20.349 --> 02:50:20.359 align:start position:0%
computation of tuition so presuming that
 
02:50:22.830 --> 02:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
the intent were by adding um proove
 
02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
school is is to open it up to to to
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
allow to private schools this says I'm
 
02:50:30.429 --> 02:50:30.439 align:start position:0%
again I'm on page three line 11 it says
 
02:50:33.389 --> 02:50:33.399 align:start position:0%
um I'll start on page 10 excuse me uh
 
02:50:35.150 --> 02:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
the middle of the sentence the district
 
02:50:37.990 --> 02:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
in which the child resides shall pay
 
02:50:42.150 --> 02:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
tuition computed as provided in RSA 193
 
02:50:45.190 --> 02:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
colon 4 to the district or approved
 
02:50:48.510 --> 02:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
school so I'm going to jump to 193 colon
 
02:50:51.150 --> 02:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
4 this is one of the last sentences I
 
02:50:53.229 --> 02:50:53.239 align:start position:0%
won't read the whole statute except
 
02:50:55.910 --> 02:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
under contract the liability of any
 
02:50:58.070 --> 02:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
school district under this section for
 
02:51:00.110 --> 02:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
the tuition of any pupil shall be the
 
02:51:04.190 --> 02:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
current expenses or operation excuse me
 
02:51:06.389 --> 02:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
shall be the current expenses of
 
02:51:09.309 --> 02:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
operation of the receiving district for
 
02:51:12.229 --> 02:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
its Elementary or junior high school or
 
02:51:14.309 --> 02:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
public school of the corresponding grade
 
02:51:16.229 --> 02:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
at estimated by the State Board of
 
02:51:19.229 --> 02:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
Education for the preceding year so the
 
02:51:21.429 --> 02:51:21.439 align:start position:0%
language in the bill does not correspond
 
02:51:23.389 --> 02:51:23.399 align:start position:0%
or line up with RSA
 
02:51:26.830 --> 02:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
1934 1934 talks about public school
 
02:51:29.550 --> 02:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
tuition this bill opening up manifest
 
02:51:31.910 --> 02:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
educational hardship to private schools
 
02:51:33.150 --> 02:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the State Board of
 
02:51:35.469 --> 02:51:35.479 align:start position:0%
Education has any determination or any
 
02:51:37.790 --> 02:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
say or calculates or gathers what
 
02:51:41.229 --> 02:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
tuition is for private schools so the if
 
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to change this to open up
 
02:51:46.150 --> 02:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
provisions manifest educational hardship
 
02:51:48.190 --> 02:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
to include private schools you have to
 
02:51:50.429 --> 02:51:50.439 align:start position:0%
find some other way other than 1934 to
 
02:51:52.229 --> 02:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
determine what the tuition is going to
 
02:51:55.190 --> 02:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
be because 193 col 4 does not fit into
 
02:51:58.510 --> 02:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
this um the other aspect and I believe
 
02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
um I forget representative Tanner it may
 
02:52:02.229 --> 02:52:02.239 align:start position:0%
have been you you had some questions
 
02:52:04.190 --> 02:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
about approved school and and what does
 
02:52:06.349 --> 02:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
that mean there are two types of private
 
02:52:07.670 --> 02:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
schools that can be approved by the
 
02:52:10.469 --> 02:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Education there's well
 
02:52:11.870 --> 02:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
different kinds of private schools I
 
02:52:13.389 --> 02:52:13.399 align:start position:0%
should say there's a two approval
 
02:52:14.830 --> 02:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
processes this is in Department of
 
02:52:16.110 --> 02:52:16.120 align:start position:0%
Education rule
 
02:52:19.469 --> 02:52:19.479 align:start position:0%
400 um you can be approved for
 
02:52:22.070 --> 02:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
attendance which basically means your
 
02:52:24.790 --> 02:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
building your facility meets fire codes
 
02:52:26.469 --> 02:52:26.479 align:start position:0%
and safety standards has nothing to do
 
02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
with academics or curriculum performance
 
02:52:31.150 --> 02:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
assessment anything like that and then
 
02:52:32.870 --> 02:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
there's also Department of Education
 
02:52:32.880 --> 02:52:35.429 align:start position:0%
there's also Department of Education
rule

02:52:35.429 --> 02:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:38.790 --> 02:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
44.2 those are um private schools where
 
02:52:41.630 --> 02:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education um does
 
02:52:43.790 --> 02:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
actually approve their program I don't
 
02:52:45.550 --> 02:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
know if they approve their their
 
02:52:47.429 --> 02:52:47.439 align:start position:0%
curriculum and assessments the same way
 
02:52:48.950 --> 02:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
that the that the department does for
 
02:52:51.950 --> 02:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
public schools um and there is some
 
02:52:55.910 --> 02:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
minimal talk if you will um
 
02:52:58.870 --> 02:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
44.2 um the nonpublic school shall
 
02:53:02.110 --> 02:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the relationship described
 
02:53:06.150 --> 02:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
above as follows um a list in and and
 
02:53:07.750 --> 02:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
description of courses offered for
 
02:53:09.950 --> 02:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
credit um noting whether it's required
 
02:53:12.790 --> 02:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
or elective art music drama dance so on
 
02:53:15.469 --> 02:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
and so forth um but guess the bigger
 
02:53:18.469 --> 02:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
point is that that program approval when
 
02:53:20.710 --> 02:53:20.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education is approving
 
02:53:24.110 --> 02:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
the program of a private school um that
 
02:53:26.790 --> 02:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
44.2 is about a page long maybe a page
 
02:53:29.229 --> 02:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
and a half long the approval process for
 
02:53:32.229 --> 02:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
public schools is about 80 pages long um
 
02:53:34.910 --> 02:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
so it it's certainly not the same as the
 
02:53:37.309 --> 02:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
approval that's required for for a
 
02:53:39.150 --> 02:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate education
 
02:53:40.790 --> 02:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
which is which is required under the New
 
02:53:43.469 --> 02:53:43.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution um I think those
 
02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
are nsba
 
02:53:47.710 --> 02:53:47.720 align:start position:0%
um comments I think that concludes my
 
02:53:49.790 --> 02:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
testimony um the definition
 
02:53:52.389 --> 02:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
significantly changes um I haven't gone
 
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
through I believe it was representative
 
02:53:55.469 --> 02:53:55.479 align:start position:0%
Miler you mentioned how repeal and
 
02:53:58.710 --> 02:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
reenact as follows and that sort of um
 
02:54:01.990 --> 02:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
created some of the confusion I excuse
 
02:54:03.950 --> 02:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
me I haven't done a deep dive into
 
02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
current law and to see like what may be
 
02:54:08.870 --> 02:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
o inadvertently omitted if this is not
 
02:54:12.670 --> 02:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
the proper bill before us but um but
 
02:54:14.429 --> 02:54:14.439 align:start position:0%
anyway I guess the bulk of my testimony
 
02:54:16.510 --> 02:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
is this body spent the better part of
 
02:54:18.830 --> 02:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
three or four years working on this bill
 
02:54:21.030 --> 02:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
or on this issue and hsba was happy to
 
02:54:22.229 --> 02:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
help because we know it's an important
 
02:54:24.469 --> 02:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
issue for kids across the state um but
 
02:54:26.429 --> 02:54:26.439 align:start position:0%
to bring this back the following year
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
when we just made significant changes to
 
02:54:32.190 --> 02:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
the law that was um by partisan um I I I
 
02:54:33.990 --> 02:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't think is is prudent for this
 
02:54:35.910 --> 02:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee right now so um we would
 
02:54:38.110 --> 02:54:38.120 align:start position:0%
certainly urge you to um to oppose our
 
02:54:40.389 --> 02:54:40.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to find um House Bill 388 and
 
02:54:42.630 --> 02:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and with that I'm
 
02:54:44.990 --> 02:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
02:54:48.269 --> 02:54:48.279 align:start position:0%
thank you um any questions from the
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
committee seeing
 
02:54:52.910 --> 02:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
none thank you
 
02:54:56.469 --> 02:54:56.479 align:start position:0%
Mr thank you all you all right next we
 
02:55:00.070 --> 02:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
have an Marie
 
02:55:03.070 --> 02:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
Danfield uh and Maria I promoted you
 
02:55:06.590 --> 02:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:10.070 --> 02:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
again okay good morning um well
 
02:55:13.070 --> 02:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon so my name is anarie Banfield
 
02:55:15.429 --> 02:55:15.439 align:start position:0%
I am an advocate for rights and academic
 
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
excellence and
 
02:55:19.790 --> 02:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
education I come here today uh I was
 
02:55:22.389 --> 02:55:22.399 align:start position:0%
actually asked by a parent to read her
 
02:55:24.950 --> 02:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
testimony so this is not my personal
 
02:55:27.229 --> 02:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
testimony this would be from Shannon
 
02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
bushard uh I did ask her to make sure
 
02:55:32.309 --> 02:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
that she emails the Comm committee with
 
02:55:35.229 --> 02:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
written testimony so that you have it I
 
02:55:36.830 --> 02:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
also would like to mention that I just
 
02:55:38.670 --> 02:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
received her written testimony so I ask
 
02:55:42.070 --> 02:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
you to bear with me as I go through it
 
02:55:45.550 --> 02:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
uh as I'm actually reading it um at the
 
02:55:47.550 --> 02:55:47.560 align:start position:0%
same time as as you are or as that
 
02:55:50.870 --> 02:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're listening to it Miss as you um go
 
02:55:52.630 --> 02:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
through that could you try and summarize
 
02:55:56.389 --> 02:55:56.399 align:start position:0%
best as you best you can well I I could
 
02:55:58.309 --> 02:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
except that I I haven't gone through it
 
02:55:59.870 --> 02:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't think I would be able to to
 
02:56:03.269 --> 02:56:03.279 align:start position:0%
do that um it's not too long but I do
 
02:56:06.030 --> 02:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
think it's important to listen to her
 
02:56:08.469 --> 02:56:08.479 align:start position:0%
personal situation especially in light
 
02:56:10.110 --> 02:56:10.120 align:start position:0%
of what you're speaking about right now
 
02:56:11.469 --> 02:56:11.479 align:start position:0%
if you've worked on this for three to
 
02:56:13.750 --> 02:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
four years and this is what you came up
 
02:56:16.670 --> 02:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
with and we have parents that are still
 
02:56:19.269 --> 02:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh having issues or problems then I
 
02:56:22.150 --> 02:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
think that this would be something that
 
02:56:24.389 --> 02:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
you should probably consider as you look
 
02:56:27.030 --> 02:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
at this new bill so I'll make it as
 
02:56:28.910 --> 02:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
quick as possible I don't think it's
 
02:56:31.429 --> 02:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
very long but uh I'll begin with um
 
02:56:34.030 --> 02:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
Shannon buard uh my daughter was
 
02:56:36.550 --> 02:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
harassed repeatedly at her school after
 
02:56:38.550 --> 02:56:38.560 align:start position:0%
winning the Manifest education Hearing
 
02:56:40.910 --> 02:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
in August I was excited that my daughter
 
02:56:42.990 --> 02:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
would have a chance to get a new start
 
02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
in a new Public School
 
02:56:46.710 --> 02:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
I have now been working since the end of
 
02:56:48.710 --> 02:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
August to try to obtain a new district
 
02:56:51.710 --> 02:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
for her to attend the problem is this no
 
02:56:54.150 --> 02:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
school will accept her at this time and
 
02:56:56.630 --> 02:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
manifest educational hardship law does
 
02:56:58.550 --> 02:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
not protect my child in making this
 
02:57:01.389 --> 02:57:01.399 align:start position:0%
happen I was foolishly thinking if I had
 
02:57:03.510 --> 02:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
the hearing in my favor that we would be
 
02:57:06.269 --> 02:57:06.279 align:start position:0%
able to start fresh since the hearing in
 
02:57:07.910 --> 02:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
August I have read the Manifest
 
02:57:10.190 --> 02:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
education law over and over and over and
 
02:57:12.910 --> 02:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
it tells no way that any public school
 
02:57:15.269 --> 02:57:15.279 align:start position:0%
has to accept a hardship case this
 
02:57:17.389 --> 02:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
leaves the parent and child possibly
 
02:57:19.429 --> 02:57:19.439 align:start position:0%
having to remain at the district where
 
02:57:21.830 --> 02:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
the bully harassment has occurred my
 
02:57:24.469 --> 02:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
daughter and my family have had extreme
 
02:57:27.670 --> 02:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
anxiety at not finding a new school the
 
02:57:30.630 --> 02:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
meh was WR as written does not allow her
 
02:57:32.910 --> 02:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
to choose a new public school because
 
02:57:34.830 --> 02:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
you are at the mercy of the receiving
 
02:57:37.389 --> 02:57:37.399 align:start position:0%
school superintendent they are told to
 
02:57:39.750 --> 02:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
look at the best interest of the pupil
 
02:57:41.429 --> 02:57:41.439 align:start position:0%
no one is looking out for the best
 
02:57:43.790 --> 02:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
interest of my daughter this is not
 
02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:44.550 align:start position:0%
interest of my daughter this is not
right

02:57:44.550 --> 02:57:44.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:57:46.910 --> 02:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
this is unfair and we owe these children
 
02:57:49.190 --> 02:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
who have already re received so much
 
02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
trauma in their District to not have to
 
02:57:54.309 --> 02:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
worry about who will allow them to
 
02:57:57.190 --> 02:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
enroll these students awarded the meh
 
02:58:00.269 --> 02:58:00.279 align:start position:0%
did nothing wrong yet the schools made
 
02:58:03.910 --> 02:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
are made to allow allow them and they
 
02:58:06.269 --> 02:58:06.279 align:start position:0%
are getting punished again I'm sorry I'm
 
02:58:08.429 --> 02:58:08.439 align:start position:0%
trying to read it verbatim they are
 
02:58:10.590 --> 02:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
already ha they already have to leave
 
02:58:12.349 --> 02:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
the district that the bullies caused the
 
02:58:14.790 --> 02:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
hardship with my daughter does have
 
02:58:17.630 --> 02:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
friends she will be leaving behind she
 
02:58:19.950 --> 02:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
is getting punished as well as we are
 
02:58:21.710 --> 02:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that she has been
 
02:58:24.429 --> 02:58:24.439 align:start position:0%
harassed I am responsible responsible
 
02:58:26.990 --> 02:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
for transportation yet the two closest
 
02:58:29.710 --> 02:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
districts won't let her attend not only
 
02:58:31.710 --> 02:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
did I give up free Transportation yet
 
02:58:33.349 --> 02:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
now I have to drive farther to find a
 
02:58:35.950 --> 02:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
school willing to accept her the cost of
 
02:58:38.469 --> 02:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
time and fuel on us through through
 
02:58:41.110 --> 02:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
nothing in the me has nothing in the meh
 
02:58:44.670 --> 02:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
law is protecting us am not getting the
 
02:58:46.510 --> 02:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
promise that the law is intended to help
 
02:58:48.830 --> 02:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
with this is extremely damaging to my
 
02:58:50.950 --> 02:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
own relationship with my daughter I have
 
02:58:53.070 --> 02:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
never broken a promise to her I can't
 
02:58:55.229 --> 02:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
find her a school I worked really hard
 
02:58:56.950 --> 02:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
putting together my evidence to prove
 
02:58:59.590 --> 02:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
hardship I told my daughter if it was
 
02:59:01.389 --> 02:59:01.399 align:start position:0%
awarded she would never have to deal
 
02:59:03.110 --> 02:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
with going back to that school I
 
02:59:05.110 --> 02:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
promised her I thought if I did
 
02:59:06.790 --> 02:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
everything right the law would protect
 
02:59:08.950 --> 02:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
us my daughter would finally have the
 
02:59:11.110 --> 02:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
education she was promised with a free
 
02:59:14.190 --> 02:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education my daughter
 
02:59:16.550 --> 02:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
would be able to not become physically
 
02:59:19.670 --> 02:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
ill thinking of going into class I have
 
02:59:21.389 --> 02:59:21.399 align:start position:0%
had to obtain a lawyer just to be
 
02:59:23.150 --> 02:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
granted a hearing in front of the school
 
02:59:25.389 --> 02:59:25.399 align:start position:0%
board as our Superintendent at the time
 
02:59:27.830 --> 02:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
denied me saying me was not intended for
 
02:59:30.510 --> 02:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
special needs students he also said his
 
02:59:33.469 --> 02:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
answer was Final we were granted the
 
02:59:35.309 --> 02:59:35.319 align:start position:0%
hearing in August and I was finally
 
02:59:37.190 --> 02:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
allowed to go in front of the board and
 
02:59:39.429 --> 02:59:39.439 align:start position:0%
prove her educational hardship I
 
02:59:41.990 --> 02:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
honestly thought finally getting a
 
02:59:44.030 --> 02:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
hearing the law would protect my my
 
02:59:47.110 --> 02:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
child the law has failed us again the
 
02:59:49.710 --> 02:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
receiving superintendent also has
 
02:59:52.790 --> 02:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
no also said no to taking a hardship
 
02:59:55.349 --> 02:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
case and also not allowing us to
 
02:59:56.870 --> 02:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
allowing us to go before the school
 
02:59:59.269 --> 02:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
board the way the law is written she is
 
03:00:02.429 --> 03:00:02.439 align:start position:0%
able to do this as a re the way the law
 
03:00:05.349 --> 03:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
is written she is able to do this as the
 
03:00:07.349 --> 03:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
receiving District must accept the
 
03:00:10.790 --> 03:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
superintendent decision is final the meh
 
03:00:13.389 --> 03:00:13.399 align:start position:0%
bill bill has not allowed me to protect
 
03:00:14.429 --> 03:00:14.439 align:start position:0%
my daughter
 
03:00:16.630 --> 03:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
we are halfway through the school year
 
03:00:17.870 --> 03:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
and my daughter is still learning
 
03:00:20.030 --> 03:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
remotely at the same district everyone
 
03:00:22.349 --> 03:00:22.359 align:start position:0%
agreed is a hardship the lack of support
 
03:00:24.590 --> 03:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
for families after winning the me is
 
03:00:27.309 --> 03:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
huge I'm almost done the law was
 
03:00:29.429 --> 03:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
supposed to allow for a school change I
 
03:00:31.269 --> 03:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
have reached out repeatedly to my home
 
03:00:33.550 --> 03:00:33.560 align:start position:0%
district for any support they can give
 
03:00:36.150 --> 03:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
me in securing a school for hardship
 
03:00:38.150 --> 03:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
transfer they leave it up to the parent
 
03:00:40.510 --> 03:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
to figure it out the law does not make
 
03:00:42.670 --> 03:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
the school where the hardship occurred
 
03:00:44.349 --> 03:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
be responsible and helping secure
 
03:00:47.070 --> 03:00:47.080 align:start position:0%
another replacement the law as it is
 
03:00:48.870 --> 03:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
written does not help parents with their
 
03:00:51.229 --> 03:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
children I do not believe anyone had
 
03:00:53.309 --> 03:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
those intentions when it passed my
 
03:00:55.229 --> 03:00:55.239 align:start position:0%
daughter is still in the district that
 
03:00:57.469 --> 03:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
caused her so much hardship I am still
 
03:00:59.070 --> 03:00:59.080 align:start position:0%
coming up against the fact that no one
 
03:01:01.269 --> 03:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
can help me not even this the State
 
03:01:03.830 --> 03:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
Board of Education and finally the law
 
03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
was written as it's written gives
 
03:01:07.510 --> 03:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
parents the false impression that if
 
03:01:09.910 --> 03:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
they find their child to have a hardship
 
03:01:12.070 --> 03:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
because of the harassment of their child
 
03:01:14.269 --> 03:01:14.279 align:start position:0%
with their home District that there are
 
03:01:16.910 --> 03:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
supports in place to help these supports
 
03:01:18.990 --> 03:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
have failed us I hope that everyone can
 
03:01:21.790 --> 03:01:21.800 align:start position:0%
see this in support making this be what
 
03:01:25.349 --> 03:01:25.359 align:start position:0%
it was intended I was intended it was
 
03:01:27.229 --> 03:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
intended to help parents and their
 
03:01:29.790 --> 03:01:29.800 align:start position:0%
children that is not what I have found
 
03:01:33.150 --> 03:01:33.160 align:start position:0%
with the meh law at all um that is her
 
03:01:34.990 --> 03:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I want to thank you I'm
 
03:01:36.429 --> 03:01:36.439 align:start position:0%
obviously not going to be able to answer
 
03:01:39.510 --> 03:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
questions for her uh personally but I do
 
03:01:41.030 --> 03:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
hope that you will consider this going
 
03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
forward with this
 
03:01:45.870 --> 03:01:45.880 align:start position:0%
bill thank you uh
 
03:01:49.710 --> 03:01:49.720 align:start position:0%
mfield um you have one more yes we have
 
03:01:52.510 --> 03:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
Jody Underwood she is an elected
 
03:01:55.269 --> 03:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
official representing herself in support
 
03:01:57.790 --> 03:01:57.800 align:start position:0%
of the bill and she has requested to
 
03:01:59.349 --> 03:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
speak for three
 
03:02:05.510 --> 03:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:08.030 --> 03:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you it actually stopped the
 
03:02:09.590 --> 03:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
zoom thing while you said my name so I
 
03:02:12.269 --> 03:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
didn't even hear it how about
 
03:02:15.349 --> 03:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
that yay Zoom I mean zoom's been great
 
03:02:18.510 --> 03:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
um okay uh for the record my name is
 
03:02:20.229 --> 03:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
Jody Underwood I am Vice chair of the
 
03:02:24.710 --> 03:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
Cen School Board um I do support the
 
03:02:27.349 --> 03:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
idea of the change um to change the
 
03:02:29.750 --> 03:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
options for reassigning a student uh
 
03:02:32.750 --> 03:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
under manifest educational hardship but
 
03:02:35.229 --> 03:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
um I also am not happy with the other or
 
03:02:38.670 --> 03:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
approved school not in the district uh
 
03:02:41.070 --> 03:02:41.080 align:start position:0%
wording um approved and a lot of people
 
03:02:42.510 --> 03:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
have talked about this already so I'll
 
03:02:45.990 --> 03:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
try not to repeat repeat anything um
 
03:02:49.030 --> 03:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's the word approved is just not clear
 
03:02:54.229 --> 03:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
um and um Mr Christina pointed out the
 
03:02:57.269 --> 03:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
two definitions that the state has uh
 
03:02:59.150 --> 03:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
approval for program and approval for
 
03:03:03.150 --> 03:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
attendance um I'm actually um happy that
 
03:03:05.150 --> 03:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner talked about other
 
03:03:06.910 --> 03:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
possibilities because I think those will
 
03:03:10.269 --> 03:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
also fall in in line when people are
 
03:03:12.190 --> 03:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
starting to challenge this unclear
 
03:03:14.630 --> 03:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
language if this Bill does pass the way
 
03:03:18.950 --> 03:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's written um I think that programs by
 
03:03:21.070 --> 03:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
approved by learn everywhere might
 
03:03:22.910 --> 03:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
actually be the most appropriate for a
 
03:03:25.309 --> 03:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
particular child and that is the point
 
03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
of manifest educational hardship is to
 
03:03:30.030 --> 03:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
you know get the kid out of a bad
 
03:03:33.630 --> 03:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
situation um and goodness and and Ann
 
03:03:36.269 --> 03:03:36.279 align:start position:0%
Marie's testimony just now also brought
 
03:03:38.590 --> 03:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
up a really interesting point about
 
03:03:41.269 --> 03:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
there's just no teeth on the other side
 
03:03:44.630 --> 03:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
um and to go back to in earlier thing
 
03:03:47.630 --> 03:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
yeah public schools are not required to
 
03:03:50.710 --> 03:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
accept every student that is placed
 
03:03:52.990 --> 03:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
there and in this case that is one of
 
03:03:56.630 --> 03:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
them but that's a separate issue um so
 
03:03:58.630 --> 03:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
how do you how will it be figured out if
 
03:04:01.309 --> 03:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
you just leave it with the word approved
 
03:04:04.469 --> 03:04:04.479 align:start position:0%
and the way we do it is we ask a judge
 
03:04:06.269 --> 03:04:06.279 align:start position:0%
um but anyone familiar with the court
 
03:04:08.070 --> 03:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
case that led to the passage of the cin
 
03:04:10.710 --> 03:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
Bill a few years ago knows that's an
 
03:04:13.670 --> 03:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
invitation to disaster the judge in that
 
03:04:16.269 --> 03:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
case declared that the phrase including
 
03:04:19.389 --> 03:04:19.399 align:start position:0%
but not limited to actually meant
 
03:04:22.150 --> 03:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
limited to in order to rationalize the
 
03:04:24.630 --> 03:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
result that he wanted which turned out
 
03:04:26.830 --> 03:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
to be forbidding school districts to
 
03:04:29.070 --> 03:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
tuition kids to private schools under
 
03:04:31.469 --> 03:04:31.479 align:start position:0%
manifest educational hardship exactly
 
03:04:34.349 --> 03:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
the bill we're talking about today so if
 
03:04:37.750 --> 03:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
common completely unambiguous English
 
03:04:40.510 --> 03:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
words like including but not limited to
 
03:04:43.389 --> 03:04:43.399 align:start position:0%
can be twisted this way in court what
 
03:04:45.429 --> 03:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
chance do ambiguities like not in the
 
03:04:47.670 --> 03:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
district and approved have of being
 
03:04:49.150 --> 03:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
interpreted to mean what what they were
 
03:04:50.590 --> 03:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
03:04:53.349 --> 03:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
mean unless amended to make its intent
 
03:04:56.550 --> 03:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
Crystal Clear uh HB 388 practically
 
03:04:58.309 --> 03:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
guarantees more court cases and
 
03:05:00.030 --> 03:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
therefore more ludicrous judicial
 
03:05:02.710 --> 03:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
decisions please make it clear or do not
 
03:05:06.990 --> 03:05:07.000 align:start position:0%

04:02:09.030 --> 04:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
not have to accept an application
 
04:02:12.309 --> 04:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
um if there is a number of applications
 
04:02:14.070 --> 04:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
that exceed
 
04:02:17.229 --> 04:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
capacity uh they would start a waiting
 
04:02:20.070 --> 04:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
list for those
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
students um if the parent feels that an
 
04:02:26.830 --> 04:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
application is uh denied for uh a
 
04:02:29.990 --> 04:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
nonvalid reason they can appeal to the
 
04:02:33.389 --> 04:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
State Board um in accordance with 541
 
04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
the standard appeal
 
04:02:39.149 --> 04:02:39.159 align:start position:0%
process the department shall develop an
 
04:02:41.389 --> 04:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
application for uh
 
04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
enrollment and the State Board shall
 
04:02:43.920 --> 04:02:45.349 align:start position:0%
enrollment and the State Board shall
adopt

04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
04:02:49.870 --> 04:02:49.880 align:start position:0%
rules uh the I know this will come up uh
 
04:02:51.990 --> 04:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
the receiving District shall not be
 
04:02:53.950 --> 04:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
required to provide
 
04:02:56.349 --> 04:02:56.359 align:start position:0%
transportation uh to the public
 
04:03:00.110 --> 04:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
school um for children living outside
 
04:03:02.830 --> 04:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
the district the parent May provide
 
04:03:05.990 --> 04:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
transportation to a specific bus stop in
 
04:03:10.070 --> 04:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
existence for that receiving
 
04:03:16.149 --> 04:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
District um and um down on the bottom uh
 
04:03:20.830 --> 04:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
State education grants shall follow the
 
04:03:23.670 --> 04:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
pupil so uh it's a
 
04:03:29.710 --> 04:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
very simple bill I think um and it
 
04:03:29.720 --> 04:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
very simple bill I think um and it
uh

04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:03:35.349 --> 04:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
accomplishes my goal of in putting it
 
04:03:39.110 --> 04:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
forward that being to
 
04:03:42.550 --> 04:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
allow children to go to the public
 
04:03:45.349 --> 04:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
school that best meets their
 
04:03:47.990 --> 04:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
needs and I thank you Mr chairman thank
 
04:03:49.750 --> 04:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any questions
 
04:03:55.110 --> 04:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
for repres pelli Mr Miler I'm
 
04:03:57.630 --> 04:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:03:59.429 --> 04:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
represent cordellia for taking my
 
04:04:02.750 --> 04:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
questions this may be a simple bill but
 
04:04:05.469 --> 04:04:05.479 align:start position:0%
it has major ramifications for public
 
04:04:07.510 --> 04:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
education and rather than going through
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
all of the issues that I have with this
 
04:04:12.630 --> 04:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
I just have really one question and I'm
 
04:04:15.030 --> 04:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
referring to page
 
04:04:17.710 --> 04:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
one line
 
04:04:21.030 --> 04:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
25 my presumption is the way this is
 
04:04:24.070 --> 04:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
written is that no school has an option
 
04:04:27.149 --> 04:04:27.159 align:start position:0%
not to participate in this program when
 
04:04:29.309 --> 04:04:29.319 align:start position:0%
you say every school district shall
 
04:04:32.590 --> 04:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
adopt that means that the state is
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
mandating that every school district
 
04:04:38.030 --> 04:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of size or location must
 
04:04:40.590 --> 04:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
participate in this program is that
 
04:04:43.510 --> 04:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
correct uh basically the state would
 
04:04:45.510 --> 04:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
become an open enrollment state for
 
04:04:48.550 --> 04:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
public schools yes thank you very
 
04:04:50.150 --> 04:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
much other
 
04:04:50.160 --> 04:04:52.590 align:start position:0%
much other
[Music]

04:04:52.590 --> 04:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:04:55.429 --> 04:04:55.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much um um Mr
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
chair and and thank you very much
 
04:04:59.030 --> 04:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli for bringing
 
04:05:01.630 --> 04:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
this one forward um
 
04:05:04.630 --> 04:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
I'm could I just put your attention down
 
04:05:08.510 --> 04:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
to uh page one lines 22 to
 
04:05:10.950 --> 04:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
24 and and actually I want to start with
 
04:05:14.790 --> 04:05:14.800 align:start position:0%
line 24 the um the end of that sentence
 
04:05:17.630 --> 04:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
end reads that does not require
 
04:05:19.590 --> 04:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
non-resident pupils to pay an
 
04:05:24.149 --> 04:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
application fee or tuition um does that
 
04:05:30.149 --> 04:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
um sentence apply to the any the the any
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
public school up on page 22 the public
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
Academy on 22 and
 
04:05:42.229 --> 04:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
23 and the interstate compact on line 23
 
04:05:44.750 --> 04:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
does does that qualification that does
 
04:05:46.469 --> 04:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
not require non-resident students to pay
 
04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
an applic application fee or tuition
 
04:05:53.870 --> 04:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
apply to all three of those um entities
 
04:06:00.309 --> 04:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
I I believe so um uh the uh the intent
 
04:06:03.070 --> 04:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
there is that there not be a separate
 
04:06:06.389 --> 04:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
tuition charge to the parents um outside
 
04:06:10.269 --> 04:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
of the normal um has
 
04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
still so follow up on that yes so so
 
04:06:19.990 --> 04:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
then if a public school on line
 
04:06:24.750 --> 04:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
22 does have a policy for non-resident
 
04:06:26.429 --> 04:06:26.439 align:start position:0%
pupils to pay
 
04:06:29.950 --> 04:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
tuition um then that would exclude that
 
04:06:34.070 --> 04:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
public school from Roman one is that
 
04:06:38.830 --> 04:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
correct I I think uh line 24 or would
 
04:06:41.750 --> 04:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
apply in that um uh they would not be
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to charge a separate tuition fee
 
04:06:44.040 --> 04:06:48.030 align:start position:0%
allowed to charge a separate tuition fee
for

04:06:48.030 --> 04:06:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:51.269 --> 04:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
non-residents okay um
 
04:06:55.389 --> 04:06:55.399 align:start position:0%
thanks wel questions represent lady you
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
have your hand go ahead thank you Mr
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
chairman just a a couple of quick things
 
04:07:02.510 --> 04:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
um and and you know I'm new to the
 
04:07:05.309 --> 04:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
committee so I don't know have the Deep
 
04:07:07.110 --> 04:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
background that you all do but on uh
 
04:07:08.349 --> 04:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
page two
 
04:07:08.359 --> 04:07:09.550 align:start position:0%
page two
line

04:07:09.550 --> 04:07:09.560 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
10 um where it's uh the following
 
04:07:14.950 --> 04:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
reasons can a receiving District can
 
04:07:18.790 --> 04:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:21.950 --> 04:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
capacity who defines capacity how is
 
04:07:24.510 --> 04:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
that defined Can a district for example
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
simply say we don't want to go
 
04:07:30.229 --> 04:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
above I'll just make up a number 12
 
04:07:33.309 --> 04:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
students per per teacher and that is our
 
04:07:35.950 --> 04:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
capacity or is there a formal or legal
 
04:07:37.870 --> 04:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
definition of capacity in existence
 
04:07:41.870 --> 04:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
right now there is not a formal
 
04:07:45.109 --> 04:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
definition right yes than fire code you
 
04:07:48.670 --> 04:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
know things like that building codes
 
04:07:51.070 --> 04:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
thank you um and just a quick followup
 
04:07:54.189 --> 04:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
and this is where again Mike lack of
 
04:07:56.349 --> 04:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
experience on this um comes into
 
04:07:58.870 --> 04:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
play I'm looking at the bottom of page
 
04:08:01.269 --> 04:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
two there the funding section so would
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
the only funding that comes with the
 
04:08:08.189 --> 04:08:08.199 align:start position:0%
student from outside the district be the
 
04:08:12.670 --> 04:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
state funding is that it is that the
 
04:08:14.229 --> 04:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
only funding that would come with that
 
04:08:16.189 --> 04:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
student so let's say the student goes
 
04:08:18.269 --> 04:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
from I'm just going to make up from
 
04:08:20.590 --> 04:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
Jaffrey which is the Jaffrey ringe
 
04:08:23.790 --> 04:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
district and goes to uh the conal
 
04:08:26.389 --> 04:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
district is the only funding that comes
 
04:08:28.469 --> 04:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
with the student the state funding is
 
04:08:30.309 --> 04:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
that it
 
04:08:35.269 --> 04:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
corre pardon I'm sorry correct so just
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
final followup then so the idea here
 
04:08:41.109 --> 04:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
would be that the local taxpayers I know
 
04:08:42.830 --> 04:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
you said that you want to eliminate zip
 
04:08:45.309 --> 04:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
code discrimination but would this not
 
04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
then put extra burdens
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
onto the taxpayers in resident within
 
04:08:51.000 --> 04:08:52.269 align:start position:0%
onto the taxpayers in resident within
the

04:08:52.269 --> 04:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:08:54.070 --> 04:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
district because they would have to
 
04:08:55.870 --> 04:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
support the education of students who
 
04:08:58.030 --> 04:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
are not whose families are not being
 
04:09:01.070 --> 04:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
taxed um in support of that
 
04:09:05.469 --> 04:09:05.479 align:start position:0%
District uh it seems that
 
04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:09:13.389 --> 04:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
some districts might uh not want to lose
 
04:09:17.309 --> 04:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
District uh lose ex me lose enrollment
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
um this is a means for them to
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh gain enrollment in a time when
 
04:09:28.990 --> 04:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
they're um losing enrollment uh possibly
 
04:09:32.510 --> 04:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't know it seems like they maybe
 
04:09:35.030 --> 04:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
some that want to have it both ways they
 
04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
want U more funding when they lose
 
04:09:39.950 --> 04:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
students and more funding um when they
 
04:09:43.309 --> 04:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
gain students as
 
04:09:45.750 --> 04:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
well but just for clarification here
 
04:09:48.630 --> 04:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
just so I know I understand the the the
 
04:09:52.229 --> 04:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
receiving District um could potentially
 
04:09:54.990 --> 04:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
incur costs above and beyond the state
 
04:09:57.750 --> 04:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy and and you know any any other
 
04:09:59.710 --> 04:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
state monies coming but they would have
 
04:10:02.990 --> 04:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
no ability to raise that money from
 
04:10:05.790 --> 04:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
through property taxes on the family
 
04:10:07.590 --> 04:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
that is sending the student because they
 
04:10:09.269 --> 04:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
non-resident of the district
 
04:10:11.429 --> 04:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
correct that's the way the bill is laid
 
04:10:17.550 --> 04:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:20.429 --> 04:10:20.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman um and thank
 
04:10:23.710 --> 04:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
you rob cordelli for taking my question
 
04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
I have a couple very similar I'm getting
 
04:10:27.630 --> 04:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
a little more
 
04:10:32.389 --> 04:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
confused if I am in a poor school
 
04:10:34.950 --> 04:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
district for example
 
04:10:39.269 --> 04:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
Berlin and I decide under this rule I
 
04:10:41.229 --> 04:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
can go to Molton borrow which is a very
 
04:10:42.630 --> 04:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
affluent School
 
04:10:45.950 --> 04:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
District um and my mother I'm a student
 
04:10:47.870 --> 04:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
my mother goes there to asby every day
 
04:10:52.750 --> 04:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
for work so I'm leaving a what average
 
04:10:57.269 --> 04:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
$7,000 a year uh cost so we get $4,000
 
04:11:00.070 --> 04:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
transferred from Berlin to molon borrow
 
04:11:02.510 --> 04:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
but molon Bor cost must be in the High
 
04:11:05.429 --> 04:11:05.439 align:start position:0%
Teens early 20s
 
04:11:07.630 --> 04:11:07.640 align:start position:0%
so I think this following up on what
 
04:11:09.710 --> 04:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative lay was saying so that
 
04:11:12.109 --> 04:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
the residents of molon borrow who fund
 
04:11:14.070 --> 04:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
that school and now going have to be
 
04:11:16.630 --> 04:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
funding students that don't live
 
04:11:20.229 --> 04:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:22.830 --> 04:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
correct like the only money that would
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
um uh go with the child would be the
 
04:11:28.349 --> 04:11:28.359 align:start position:0%
state money right will fall so the only
 
04:11:29.950 --> 04:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
state money though is the adequacy right
 
04:11:32.590 --> 04:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
so if if molten bur cost 20,000 a year
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
to go to and Berlin costs whatever it
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
costs all they're going to get is to say
 
04:11:39.469 --> 04:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
4,5 $5,000 to come with adequacy so the
 
04:11:42.149 --> 04:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
deficit that $115,000 additional expense
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
in molten borrow the molten borrow
 
04:11:46.990 --> 04:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
residents will have to pick up and pay
 
04:11:50.229 --> 04:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
well I I thought that um when enrollment
 
04:11:53.670 --> 04:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
increased um costs were variable but
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm wrong about that well it's t
 
04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's like putting one in as you said
 
04:11:59.269 --> 04:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
putting one in and one out it doesn't
 
04:12:01.109 --> 04:12:01.119 align:start position:0%
matter much but the cost of the student
 
04:12:04.109 --> 04:12:04.119 align:start position:0%
in Ran is that much more a second part
 
04:12:06.109 --> 04:12:06.119 align:start position:0%
this this will allow um I just want to
 
04:12:08.750 --> 04:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm right the CL ification if
 
04:12:11.030 --> 04:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
I am a school district that's losing
 
04:12:13.030 --> 04:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
kids because of enrollment and I'll give
 
04:12:14.830 --> 04:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
you an example up
 
04:12:18.510 --> 04:12:18.520 align:start position:0%
here Jackson is is bartett is losing
 
04:12:20.910 --> 04:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
enrollment uh because youngsters are
 
04:12:24.149 --> 04:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
graduating um so therefore our
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
SAU uh is losing income because it's a
 
04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
tuition school so that means we could go
 
04:12:31.990 --> 04:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
out and advertise for students to come
 
04:12:34.469 --> 04:12:34.479 align:start position:0%
from other districts to come to our
 
04:12:35.870 --> 04:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
school we have low
 
04:12:39.149 --> 04:12:39.159 align:start position:0%
enrollment Cor I don't see anything in
 
04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
here that prevents um
 
04:12:45.710 --> 04:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
advertising or trying to attract
 
04:12:48.870 --> 04:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
students okay so you competitive pitting
 
04:12:51.149 --> 04:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
one school district against another so
 
04:12:54.469 --> 04:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
the last question R Celli back back in
 
04:12:55.630 --> 04:12:55.640 align:start position:0%
my district
 
04:12:58.189 --> 04:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
again because I'm just trying to
 
04:12:59.790 --> 04:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
understand non-resident right now I'm
 
04:13:01.830 --> 04:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
trying to make myself clear
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
too okay so if I may the last question I
 
04:13:10.469 --> 04:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
hope the Conway school district has some
 
04:13:13.990 --> 04:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
students that go to the fryberg academy
 
04:13:14.000 --> 04:13:15.550 align:start position:0%
students that go to the fryberg academy
in

04:13:15.550 --> 04:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:13:18.670 --> 04:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
Maine so under
 
04:13:22.189 --> 04:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
this and and we contract with them so
 
04:13:25.830 --> 04:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
under this bill does that mean more
 
04:13:28.590 --> 04:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
students could leave Conway and go to
 
04:13:31.469 --> 04:13:31.479 align:start position:0%
the fryberg academy and what what would
 
04:13:34.910 --> 04:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:38.149 --> 04:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
work um
 
04:13:41.429 --> 04:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
Conway district has it has an agreement
 
04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
with fber that they sent some of the
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
Conway the kenet students to fryberg
 
04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
Academy yeah some of the sa un9
 
04:13:52.630 --> 04:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
correct um I don't think that would be
 
04:13:55.830 --> 04:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
not a u going to another New Hampshire
 
04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
public school but that would be
 
04:14:02.070 --> 04:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
um uh I think a different situation and
 
04:14:04.510 --> 04:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
I have to find out more about the
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
Contracting situation here I think
 
04:14:08.670 --> 04:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
okay because you were talk you're
 
04:14:12.269 --> 04:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
talking about if if as as I read the
 
04:14:14.630 --> 04:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
bill if this if the school system
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
already has a contract with that
 
04:14:21.189 --> 04:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
District Interstate com pack Interstate
 
04:14:21.199 --> 04:14:24.070 align:start position:0%
District Interstate com pack Interstate
compack

04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:27.070 --> 04:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
yes so what would be the answer there
 
04:14:29.790 --> 04:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I missed so under the
 
04:14:32.550 --> 04:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
interstate Comm Interstate contract if
 
04:14:35.469 --> 04:14:35.479 align:start position:0%
sa9 already has a contract with Fook
 
04:14:37.830 --> 04:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
Academy would this allow more students
 
04:14:43.229 --> 04:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:46.349 --> 04:14:46.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I think would be the same
 
04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
they would be going under the contract
 
04:14:51.149 --> 04:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
yes whatever Provisions are in the
 
04:14:52.229 --> 04:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
contract they
 
04:14:54.510 --> 04:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
would go under the provisions of the
 
04:14:57.030 --> 04:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
contract that you have with fryberg
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
Academy okay so so the tuition would go
 
04:15:01.469 --> 04:15:01.479 align:start position:0%
so basically students could transfer
 
04:15:05.309 --> 04:15:05.319 align:start position:0%
from Conway to under this and enroll in
 
04:15:08.429 --> 04:15:08.439 align:start position:0%
fryberg okay you have an existing
 
04:15:12.189 --> 04:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
contract yeah we do okay thank you thank
 
04:15:14.030 --> 04:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you represent
 
04:15:19.070 --> 04:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:21.950 --> 04:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
Tanner so uh my question is about
 
04:15:24.030 --> 04:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
changing schools multiple times during
 
04:15:26.670 --> 04:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
the year um
 
04:15:29.590 --> 04:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
either uh can they do that either
 
04:15:31.830 --> 04:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
because they find out it's not a good
 
04:15:35.109 --> 04:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
fit for them or the school finds out
 
04:15:38.109 --> 04:15:38.119 align:start position:0%
that it's not a good fit for them
 
04:15:41.429 --> 04:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
or um I really want to play field hockey
 
04:15:43.630 --> 04:15:43.640 align:start position:0%
in the fall and Newport has a really
 
04:15:48.510 --> 04:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
good field hockey team but um gee uh
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
basketball season rolls around and
 
04:15:53.229 --> 04:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
sunup's got the best coach and then the
 
04:15:56.910 --> 04:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
spring comes and karge has a nice track
 
04:15:59.550 --> 04:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
and uh I really want to run track and
 
04:16:04.710 --> 04:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
field so can I under this uh provision
 
04:16:06.950 --> 04:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
um because they can't discriminate
 
04:16:09.389 --> 04:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
against me because of Athletics can I
 
04:16:12.870 --> 04:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
just uh go from one school to another to
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
another um or and how how does that work
 
04:16:20.309 --> 04:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
with payment and signing up and
 
04:16:22.910 --> 04:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
everything else so you're thinking that
 
04:16:26.389 --> 04:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
student might want to go to a certain
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
School regardless of Transportation or
 
04:16:32.189 --> 04:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
anything else based on um what season it
 
04:16:35.349 --> 04:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
was what sport was uh being played at
 
04:16:37.870 --> 04:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
that point absolutely absolutely either
 
04:16:41.550 --> 04:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
that or even if for example I go to I go
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
to snipy and it's a small school and I
 
04:16:46.149 --> 04:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
find out that gee I'm I I don't fit in
 
04:16:49.630 --> 04:16:49.640 align:start position:0%
there either so in December I decide I
 
04:16:52.030 --> 04:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
want to go to karge and then I find out
 
04:16:54.870 --> 04:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
I don't fit in there so maybe I'll
 
04:16:57.870 --> 04:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
try um I don't know Proctor
 
04:17:00.710 --> 04:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
Academy um I would have to look at the
 
04:17:04.189 --> 04:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
athletic association um agreements I
 
04:17:09.229 --> 04:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:11.550 --> 04:17:11.560 align:start position:0%
oh students would be enrolled well it's
 
04:17:14.189 --> 04:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
it's legal it's legal if you're enrolled
 
04:17:17.429 --> 04:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
in that particular school abely um to
 
04:17:20.189 --> 04:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
play uh for that they can't deny you
 
04:17:22.550 --> 04:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activities um you know
 
04:17:24.349 --> 04:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
it could be the math team I want to do
 
04:17:27.469 --> 04:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
the math team at karge the literary Club
 
04:17:29.229 --> 04:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
at snipy
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
and um I don't know um play pickle ball
 
04:17:37.229 --> 04:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
over at Newport um can they Chang
 
04:17:39.030 --> 04:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
schools multiple times during the year
 
04:17:39.040 --> 04:17:40.910 align:start position:0%
schools multiple times during the year
under

04:17:40.910 --> 04:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:17:44.630 --> 04:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
this and how does the money roll student
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
families can currently move from one
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
District to another during the school
 
04:17:50.830 --> 04:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
year multiple
 
04:17:54.830 --> 04:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
times yep so but they're not moving so
 
04:17:57.670 --> 04:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
they're moving the child and there's a
 
04:18:00.109 --> 04:18:00.119 align:start position:0%
money issue here that's how does the
 
04:18:02.550 --> 04:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
money issue move with the kid with the
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
student no different than if the family
 
04:18:08.229 --> 04:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
moved well yes it is because in this
 
04:18:12.109 --> 04:18:12.119 align:start position:0%
bill the money moves with the student so
 
04:18:14.550 --> 04:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
if a student goes to sunap the money
 
04:18:17.790 --> 04:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
comes out of karge and goes to
 
04:18:20.510 --> 04:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
snipy um and they're there in the fall
 
04:18:25.109 --> 04:18:25.119 align:start position:0%
for maybe 4,000 or $5,000 but then does
 
04:18:29.630 --> 04:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
snipy have to pay Newport pro-rated if
 
04:18:31.630 --> 04:18:31.640 align:start position:0%
the student moves to
 
04:18:34.710 --> 04:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
Newport to play
 
04:18:38.670 --> 04:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
basketball I uh I I don't see it any
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
differently than if the family
 
04:18:43.070 --> 04:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
moves during the course of the school
 
04:18:46.790 --> 04:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
year and I I could come up with 101
 
04:18:49.309 --> 04:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
hypothetical situations that uh I think
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
are strictly
 
04:18:53.389 --> 04:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
hypothetical these aren't hypothetical
 
04:18:56.830 --> 04:18:56.840 align:start position:0%
students move people people move because
 
04:19:00.109 --> 04:19:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:02.870 --> 04:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
mean um and wouldn't it be nice if we
 
04:19:05.429 --> 04:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
allowed students to move elsewhere if
 
04:19:07.469 --> 04:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
they don't fit in the school that
 
04:19:09.790 --> 04:19:09.800 align:start position:0%
they're in yeah that would be great and
 
04:19:11.950 --> 04:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
that's really the whole purpose of a lot
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
of the choice bills that um we are
 
04:19:19.349 --> 04:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:19:24.670 --> 04:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli for uh taking my
 
04:19:28.309 --> 04:19:28.319 align:start position:0%
question so um am I correct when I read
 
04:19:33.590 --> 04:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
this bill that um a school district like
 
04:19:37.550 --> 04:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
Bedford that has in fact successfully
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
charged students tuition to
 
04:19:45.030 --> 04:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
attend uh would you believe the faculty
 
04:19:47.950 --> 04:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
who want their kids to uh attend Bedford
 
04:19:50.189 --> 04:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
schools while they work in Bedford
 
04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
actually have to pay upwards of5 $16,000
 
04:19:56.670 --> 04:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
a year if they want their kids to attend
 
04:20:01.109 --> 04:20:01.119 align:start position:0%
am I correct that under this plan you
 
04:20:03.149 --> 04:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
would the the school district would no
 
04:20:09.269 --> 04:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:10.870 --> 04:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:20:14.189 --> 04:20:14.199 align:start position:0%
um uh I would like to examine that
 
04:20:16.750 --> 04:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
situation further I hadn't considered um
 
04:20:20.109 --> 04:20:20.119 align:start position:0%
the uh scenario that you bring up okay
 
04:20:22.189 --> 04:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
all right um could I have a follow-up
 
04:20:25.349 --> 04:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
question um I I did notice that also a
 
04:20:29.149 --> 04:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
provision in the bill uh says that if a
 
04:20:32.790 --> 04:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
parent a parent has to provide their own
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
transportation but the bill says that
 
04:20:37.349 --> 04:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
they can basically drive them over the
 
04:20:40.469 --> 04:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
Town Line and drop them at the closest
 
04:20:42.790 --> 04:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
bus stop or whatever an appointed bus
 
04:20:46.349 --> 04:20:46.359 align:start position:0%
stop and then the school will provide
 
04:20:46.359 --> 04:20:47.389 align:start position:0%
stop and then the school will provide
the

04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
transportation from that bus stop to the
 
04:20:53.189 --> 04:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
school is that a correct assumption
 
04:20:58.269 --> 04:20:58.279 align:start position:0%
yes okay and is there any kind of um
 
04:20:58.279 --> 04:21:00.149 align:start position:0%
yes okay and is there any kind of um
provision

04:21:00.149 --> 04:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
provision
 
04:21:03.269 --> 04:21:03.279 align:start position:0%
for limiting the number of kids on a
 
04:21:06.630 --> 04:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
particular bus route or would we leave
 
04:21:08.269 --> 04:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
that up to the school
 
04:21:11.349 --> 04:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
districts um that would be a local
 
04:21:13.830 --> 04:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
decision I
 
04:21:16.990 --> 04:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
think okay thank you you could look at
 
04:21:19.550 --> 04:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
capacity it could be capacity of a
 
04:21:22.469 --> 04:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
bus yeah I I just um I had some
 
04:21:23.870 --> 04:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
questions about that because when
 
04:21:25.750 --> 04:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
somebody else asked the capacity
 
04:21:27.070 --> 04:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
question about a
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
classroom um there didn't seem to be an
 
04:21:33.630 --> 04:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
easy way to determine what the capacity
 
04:21:37.429 --> 04:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
in a classroom was going to be um and I
 
04:21:38.910 --> 04:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
just wondered whether or not that would
 
04:21:40.710 --> 04:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
also apply to
 
04:21:42.910 --> 04:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation thank
 
04:21:45.670 --> 04:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
you I might add to everybody out there
 
04:21:48.750 --> 04:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
that they do have a capacity in terms of
 
04:21:51.510 --> 04:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
our school building a program they take
 
04:21:53.349 --> 04:21:53.359 align:start position:0%
the square footage in a room and you
 
04:21:55.229 --> 04:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
know many of the rooms are built around
 
04:21:57.590 --> 04:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
let's say a th000 square feet in the
 
04:22:01.030 --> 04:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
elementary school and they have so many
 
04:22:02.830 --> 04:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
square feet that are allocated for
 
04:22:05.550 --> 04:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
students so you can develop capacity
 
04:22:09.189 --> 04:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
that way most districts though are are
 
04:22:12.590 --> 04:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
the pupil teacher ratio the PTR varies
 
04:22:14.550 --> 04:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
significantly from let's say a
 
04:22:17.910 --> 04:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester I'm sure it's well over 20 25
 
04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
to smaller school districts where it may
 
04:22:21.070 --> 04:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
only be
 
04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
10 so um but there are some uh capacity
 
04:22:27.710 --> 04:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
limits set within School building Aid
 
04:22:31.510 --> 04:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:33.790 --> 04:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
schools okay further questions I
 
04:22:37.229 --> 04:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
represent pel represent representative
 
04:22:41.030 --> 04:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
lad I just have one followup yeses yeah
 
04:22:44.309 --> 04:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
just the FYI um and follow up on
 
04:22:46.950 --> 04:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative mullen's comment uh the
 
04:22:50.790 --> 04:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
teacher tuition piece is relevant in the
 
04:22:54.030 --> 04:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
Conway District as well we have te
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
because Conway has like I would assume
 
04:22:58.309 --> 04:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
Regional Schools as well Conway for sure
 
04:23:01.269 --> 04:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
where blet and Jackson make up part of
 
04:23:05.630 --> 04:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
the SAU but they have different tuition
 
04:23:08.269 --> 04:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
uh fees and cost from each town so
 
04:23:10.149 --> 04:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
teachers that work in Bartlett and live
 
04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
in Conway similar to sus point if those
 
04:23:14.550 --> 04:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
teachers want their youngster to go to
 
04:23:15.510 --> 04:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
the botet school with them in the
 
04:23:17.710 --> 04:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
morning for all kinds of reasons they
 
04:23:20.950 --> 04:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
have to pay the full tuition so so
 
04:23:23.149 --> 04:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
that's that was same as the idea of the
 
04:23:25.389 --> 04:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
the tuition for low other schools suck
 
04:23:27.550 --> 04:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
up the cost but that was the it's
 
04:23:29.030 --> 04:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
relevant that happens all over at least
 
04:23:30.109 --> 04:23:30.119 align:start position:0%
I know what does up in our area of the
 
04:23:32.590 --> 04:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
country just the point of
 
04:23:34.710 --> 04:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
interest thank
 
04:23:41.429 --> 04:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:43.109 --> 04:23:43.119 align:start position:0%
Mullen has her hand
 
04:23:45.910 --> 04:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
up look I was trying not to be greedy
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
the last time around and Rapid Fire
 
04:23:52.269 --> 04:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
questions so I paused um so with the
 
04:23:54.870 --> 04:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
back to the capacity issue so if we have
 
04:23:57.550 --> 04:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
a situation where let's say we start a
 
04:24:00.229 --> 04:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
school year and the capacity in an
 
04:24:03.710 --> 04:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
Elementary classroom is 25 students and
 
04:24:07.389 --> 04:24:07.399 align:start position:0%
the town has filled 20 of those seats
 
04:24:09.189 --> 04:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
according to this bill if I'm correct
 
04:24:11.510 --> 04:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative Cordell five seats would
 
04:24:15.389 --> 04:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
then be up for application for people
 
04:24:16.670 --> 04:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
who were
 
04:24:20.189 --> 04:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
non-residents so if we fill those five
 
04:24:21.910 --> 04:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
seats with
 
04:24:26.030 --> 04:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
nonresidents and then 17 new second
 
04:24:28.710 --> 04:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
graders move to school over the course
 
04:24:30.070 --> 04:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
of the school
 
04:24:34.229 --> 04:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
year what do what happens then it I know
 
04:24:35.910 --> 04:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
the bill said that you shouldn't have to
 
04:24:38.109 --> 04:24:38.119 align:start position:0%
Prov provide additional
 
04:24:41.950 --> 04:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
staff but what if the enrollments go up
 
04:24:48.229 --> 04:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:53.389 --> 04:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
that that is a a question um that uh I
 
04:24:55.469 --> 04:24:55.479 align:start position:0%
think we uh could look further at in
 
04:25:01.630 --> 04:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:05.070 --> 04:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
here further questions repres
 
04:25:05.080 --> 04:25:07.750 align:start position:0%
here further questions repres
cellan

04:25:07.750 --> 04:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
cellan
 
04:25:11.429 --> 04:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
not seeing any thank you very much uh
 
04:25:14.429 --> 04:25:14.439 align:start position:0%
represent okay next we have um jim
 
04:25:18.309 --> 04:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
oconnell I've promoted him uh welcome to
 
04:25:21.830 --> 04:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
education go ahead please um thank you
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
um my name is Jim oconnell I'm a school
 
04:25:26.030 --> 04:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
board member at large in the city of
 
04:25:28.349 --> 04:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester I'm uh I'm here I'm opposed
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
to this Bill I'm here to speak on my own
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
behalf today um I thank you for um
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
having the opportunity to speak with you
 
04:25:40.750 --> 04:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
all uh twice in one week um and uh so um
 
04:25:44.269 --> 04:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
this bill um I I I think with with great
 
04:25:47.550 --> 04:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
respect to the sponsor of the bill I I I
 
04:25:51.189 --> 04:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
believe it is ill thought true and uh I
 
04:25:54.349 --> 04:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
think it's it's an idea that might seem
 
04:25:57.630 --> 04:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable when written as a single line
 
04:26:00.109 --> 04:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
let's have people let's have educational
 
04:26:02.309 --> 04:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
be fungible and people be able to go
 
04:26:04.429 --> 04:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
wherever they want and that that just
 
04:26:07.309 --> 04:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
simply doesn't match reality so some as
 
04:26:09.590 --> 04:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
an example um if we look at the
 
04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
contributing towns issue we've talked
 
04:26:12.710 --> 04:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
about some of the issues in other towns
 
04:26:14.870 --> 04:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
in contributing towns the town of
 
04:26:17.269 --> 04:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
hookset sends students to Manchester
 
04:26:19.070 --> 04:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
right now and Manchester charges for
 
04:26:21.550 --> 04:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
that um they send large numbers of
 
04:26:24.109 --> 04:26:24.119 align:start position:0%
students to Pinkerton Academy I I think
 
04:26:25.790 --> 04:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
they probably spend send maybe a couple
 
04:26:28.510 --> 04:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
of hundred who are paying perhaps
 
04:26:31.189 --> 04:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
between 12 15,000 or something like that
 
04:26:33.349 --> 04:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
right now my understanding is that those
 
04:26:35.109 --> 04:26:35.119 align:start position:0%
revenues would all go away on this on
 
04:26:38.070 --> 04:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
this road it this this bill as it stands
 
04:26:41.229 --> 04:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
would play Havoc with the existing situa
 
04:26:42.990 --> 04:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
the actual situation on the ground the
 
04:26:46.070 --> 04:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
reality is we have if people send kids
 
04:26:48.269 --> 04:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
to schools we fund them through property
 
04:26:51.070 --> 04:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
taxes the property taxes are paid by
 
04:26:54.590 --> 04:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
Property Owners when I sell my house in
 
04:26:57.149 --> 04:26:57.159 align:start position:0%
in Bedford and move to Manchester um
 
04:26:58.550 --> 04:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's an accommodation made through
 
04:27:00.550 --> 04:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
the real estate transactions besides how
 
04:27:02.109 --> 04:27:02.119 align:start position:0%
my taxes have dispersed between those
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
two towns there is no process by which
 
04:27:08.189 --> 04:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
tenants in those buildings or or that I
 
04:27:10.030 --> 04:27:10.040 align:start position:0%
could swap that those taxes through
 
04:27:13.109 --> 04:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
Treet towns it'd be anal analogous to me
 
04:27:15.590 --> 04:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
buying a house in Manchester in January
 
04:27:18.030 --> 04:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
selling it buying a house in Bedford in
 
04:27:20.109 --> 04:27:20.119 align:start position:0%
March selling it buying a house in
 
04:27:23.030 --> 04:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
Tuftonboro in April and selling it again
 
04:27:25.389 --> 04:27:25.399 align:start position:0%
and buying another house in conquer in
 
04:27:27.950 --> 04:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
in in in in October and somehow we'd
 
04:27:30.750 --> 04:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
like the school systems to work out how
 
04:27:32.389 --> 04:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
the tax dollar should be distributed
 
04:27:34.750 --> 04:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
across the schools in those districts it
 
04:27:37.950 --> 04:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
is faral it is unworkable and ought to
 
04:27:39.830 --> 04:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
be addressed before this bill goes
 
04:27:42.429 --> 04:27:42.439 align:start position:0%
beyond where it is today um I don't
 
04:27:43.990 --> 04:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
agree with the bill because what what we
 
04:27:46.109 --> 04:27:46.119 align:start position:0%
ought to be doing I think is we ought to
 
04:27:47.790 --> 04:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
be raising the standards in all our
 
04:27:49.309 --> 04:27:49.319 align:start position:0%
elementary schools our middle schools
 
04:27:50.790 --> 04:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
and our high schools in all public
 
04:27:53.429 --> 04:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
schools we have looked at the funding
 
04:27:54.990 --> 04:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
issue in the state we know it's
 
04:27:57.790 --> 04:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
inadequate we know that it's inequitable
 
04:27:59.950 --> 04:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
and uh and I I would love to see this
 
04:28:02.990 --> 04:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee concentrating its efforts on
 
04:28:05.389 --> 04:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
providing an adequate education to the
 
04:28:07.229 --> 04:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
young people people of the State of New
 
04:28:09.550 --> 04:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh and that's I believe
 
04:28:11.229 --> 04:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
where we should start with with great
 
04:28:13.469 --> 04:28:13.479 align:start position:0%
respect thank you for hearing me today
 
04:28:15.149 --> 04:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
and uh I'd be happy to answer any
 
04:28:16.750 --> 04:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
questions that didn't address the issue
 
04:28:19.189 --> 04:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
issue in Manchester where we do have
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
people in different school districts
 
04:28:23.790 --> 04:28:23.800 align:start position:0%
within our city um who uh so we see this
 
04:28:25.790 --> 04:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
in microcosm and in our city but anyway
 
04:28:28.149 --> 04:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
I I won't proceed further I'd ask you
 
04:28:30.189 --> 04:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
not to support this bill and thank you
 
04:28:32.750 --> 04:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you very much Mr ell
 
04:28:36.990 --> 04:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
are there any questions uh for Mr oono
 
04:28:39.910 --> 04:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank
 
04:28:43.870 --> 04:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
you okay next next next we have John
 
04:28:48.269 --> 04:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
brano he is a member of the public
 
04:28:50.910 --> 04:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield New Hampshire school district
 
04:28:53.309 --> 04:28:53.319 align:start position:0%
he opposes the bill and says he needs
 
04:28:57.070 --> 04:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
three minutes to speak welcome to
 
04:28:59.269 --> 04:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
education thank you very much I
 
04:29:01.149 --> 04:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity and I will
 
04:29:03.750 --> 04:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
take less than three minutes today I'm
 
04:29:06.189 --> 04:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
the relatively new interim
 
04:29:08.429 --> 04:29:08.439 align:start position:0%
superintendent of schools in
 
04:29:11.950 --> 04:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield and I'm opposed to HB
 
04:29:15.590 --> 04:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
455 I believe passing of this bill will
 
04:29:17.630 --> 04:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
provide daunting challenges for
 
04:29:20.229 --> 04:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield residents and taxpayers
 
04:29:24.429 --> 04:29:24.439 align:start position:0%
including many Rural and property poor
 
04:29:26.550 --> 04:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
communities the inequities that could
 
04:29:29.189 --> 04:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
Foster have grave potential to create a
 
04:29:32.149 --> 04:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
further divide of communities who are
 
04:29:34.990 --> 04:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
blessed with more resources than those
 
04:29:38.670 --> 04:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
that are challenged Ed by the economic
 
04:29:42.750 --> 04:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
disparity for me this seems
 
04:29:45.710 --> 04:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
like a challenge between the halves and
 
04:29:48.870 --> 04:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
the Have Nots um I think there are a lot
 
04:29:52.070 --> 04:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:55.070 --> 04:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
question for example eventually how we
 
04:29:57.790 --> 04:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
we plan longterm for the retention of
 
04:29:59.750 --> 04:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
faculty and staff what about our
 
04:30:01.590 --> 04:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
obligation to our most challenged
 
04:30:03.590 --> 04:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
students what about special education
 
04:30:05.950 --> 04:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
services and what do they look like what
 
04:30:07.830 --> 04:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
about the loss of revenues from Grant
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
monies from students leaving the
 
04:30:10.000 --> 04:30:12.229 align:start position:0%
monies from students leaving the
district

04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:30:15.910 --> 04:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
um I encourage you to defeat House Bill
 
04:30:18.189 --> 04:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
455 and I thank you again for the
 
04:30:19.950 --> 04:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity I know you're very busy and
 
04:30:24.590 --> 04:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it thank you very much Mr
 
04:30:29.389 --> 04:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:31.750 --> 04:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
player thanks John are there any
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
04:30:36.429 --> 04:30:36.439 align:start position:0%
the thank you than you Mr chairman and
 
04:30:39.630 --> 04:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for taking my question um
 
04:30:43.550 --> 04:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
could you envision a scenario where a
 
04:30:45.910 --> 04:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
student uh because there doesn't seem
 
04:30:49.149 --> 04:30:49.159 align:start position:0%
any there's not really much left to the
 
04:30:50.790 --> 04:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
receiving District by which they could
 
04:30:53.790 --> 04:30:53.800 align:start position:0%
deny a student uh seeking to transfer in
 
04:30:55.309 --> 04:30:55.319 align:start position:0%
but could you envision a scenario where
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
a student um transfers in from out of
 
04:31:03.630 --> 04:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
district and then has to be sent out um
 
04:31:06.950 --> 04:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
for special needs and special education
 
04:31:09.950 --> 04:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
um hardship cases and that the and who
 
04:31:16.750 --> 04:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:19.149 --> 04:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
that was that a question from Mr
 
04:31:19.159 --> 04:31:21.149 align:start position:0%
that was that a question from Mr
Graziano

04:31:21.149 --> 04:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
Graziano
 
04:31:25.550 --> 04:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
yes I'm not sure um and that's why you
 
04:31:28.550 --> 04:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
know I'm I'm here today I I would say
 
04:31:30.990 --> 04:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
politely I'm confused I don't understand
 
04:31:33.630 --> 04:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
it um and I think that those
 
04:31:36.149 --> 04:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
unanswerable questions today
 
04:31:38.309 --> 04:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
create in my mind the potential
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
disparity and the difficulty and the you
 
04:31:46.030 --> 04:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
know inable voyages that we may have to
 
04:31:49.109 --> 04:31:49.119 align:start position:0%
travel and I say may we don't know for
 
04:31:52.990 --> 04:31:53.000 align:start position:0%

and members of house education for the
 
04:32:38.630 --> 04:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
record my name is Carl lad the executive
 
04:32:39.870 --> 04:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire school
 
04:32:41.790 --> 04:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
administrators Association it is a
 
04:32:46.469 --> 04:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
mouthful um nhsaa opposes 455 for many
 
04:32:49.149 --> 04:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
reasons it raises far more questions
 
04:32:51.790 --> 04:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
than it answers it has the potential to
 
04:32:53.950 --> 04:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
discriminate against families from lower
 
04:32:57.109 --> 04:32:57.119 align:start position:0%
lower socioeconomic situations as well
 
04:32:59.630 --> 04:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
as students with special needs will
 
04:33:01.790 --> 04:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
widen the achievement gaps not lessen
 
04:33:04.910 --> 04:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
them increase costs for both receiving
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
and resident districts undermines local
 
04:33:10.789 --> 04:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
control and creates inconsistencies with
 
04:33:13.029 --> 04:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
a number of statutes already on the
 
04:33:15.429 --> 04:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
books um and it really appears to be
 
04:33:18.029 --> 04:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
more of a national agenda than it does
 
04:33:19.510 --> 04:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire
 
04:33:21.869 --> 04:33:21.879 align:start position:0%
need in New Hampshire we already have
 
04:33:29.349 --> 04:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:33.109 --> 04:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
194-31 allows for students to leave
 
04:33:35.390 --> 04:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
persistently dangerous schools we have
 
04:33:37.150 --> 04:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
have our current manifest education
 
04:33:39.750 --> 04:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
hardship law and the federal Essa law
 
04:33:43.310 --> 04:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
section 1111 D1 school choice for
 
04:33:45.029 --> 04:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
students attending comprehensive School
 
04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
Improvement or CSI schools uh there seem
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
to be sufficient laws on the books for
 
04:33:51.789 --> 04:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
families here in New Hampshire uh if
 
04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
they are truly negatively impacted by
 
04:33:56.670 --> 04:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
their local school district and some of
 
04:33:58.429 --> 04:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
the most glaring questions that comes
 
04:34:01.230 --> 04:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
out of this how will this legislation
 
04:34:04.029 --> 04:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
affect long-term tuition contracts and
 
04:34:06.429 --> 04:34:06.439 align:start position:0%
area agreements
 
04:34:08.990 --> 04:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli indicated that
 
04:34:11.869 --> 04:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
the contracts would be honored however
 
04:34:14.390 --> 04:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's not what the bill says many
 
04:34:16.470 --> 04:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
school districts have sized facilities
 
04:34:18.990 --> 04:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
and staff based on contracts that have
 
04:34:21.590 --> 04:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
been implemented and this legislation
 
04:34:23.789 --> 04:34:23.799 align:start position:0%
would upend those agreements uh that
 
04:34:25.629 --> 04:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
have been made and have been put in
 
04:34:29.390 --> 04:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
place for over 60 years in some cases
 
04:34:31.349 --> 04:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
and would really appear to
 
04:34:33.789 --> 04:34:33.799 align:start position:0%
undermine many of the statutes already
 
04:34:35.910 --> 04:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
on the book such as RSA
 
04:34:39.029 --> 04:34:39.039 align:start position:0%
19334 and five I think that we really
 
04:34:41.230 --> 04:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
need to be cautious about this the
 
04:34:42.869 --> 04:34:42.879 align:start position:0%
biggest question is around special
 
04:34:45.709 --> 04:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
education which um representative Le
 
04:34:47.709 --> 04:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
just mentioned who's going to be
 
04:34:49.470 --> 04:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for Education special
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
education services the resident or the
 
04:34:54.830 --> 04:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
receiving District RSA 186 would
 
04:34:56.590 --> 04:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
indicate that the resident District
 
04:34:58.750 --> 04:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
would be responsible but who makes the
 
04:35:01.150 --> 04:35:01.160 align:start position:0%
determination of services when
 
04:35:02.949 --> 04:35:02.959 align:start position:0%
evaluations and determination of
 
04:35:05.390 --> 04:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
Eligibility are required Which special
 
04:35:08.310 --> 04:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
Education team has that responsibility
 
04:35:11.470 --> 04:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
that's defined under Ed 1105 and
 
04:35:13.670 --> 04:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
ed18 which district is going to be
 
04:35:15.910 --> 04:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for developing the IEP as
 
04:35:17.310 --> 04:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
defined in Ed
 
04:35:20.109 --> 04:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
1109 for students requiring specialized
 
04:35:22.470 --> 04:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
program which district must provide
 
04:35:25.990 --> 04:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
additional funds to fund the program if
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
parents file a complaint which district
 
04:35:29.830 --> 04:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be held accountable for the
 
04:35:32.189 --> 04:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
findings the resident District which no
 
04:35:34.150 --> 04:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
longer educates the student but
 
04:35:35.869 --> 04:35:35.879 align:start position:0%
responsible for the funding
 
04:35:37.310 --> 04:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
or the receiving District who's
 
04:35:39.869 --> 04:35:39.879 align:start position:0%
educating the student if there are
 
04:35:42.029 --> 04:35:42.039 align:start position:0%
monetary Awards or findings who's going
 
04:35:44.629 --> 04:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
to be responsible for paying for them
 
04:35:47.029 --> 04:35:47.039 align:start position:0%
how will Ida Grant allocations and
 
04:35:48.750 --> 04:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
funding reimbursements under special
 
04:35:52.551 --> 04:35:52.561 align:start position:0%
education Aid or Medicaid to schools be
 
04:35:55.670 --> 04:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
decided is this really a choice
 
04:35:58.709 --> 04:35:58.719 align:start position:0%
regardless of the law you pass receiving
 
04:36:00.189 --> 04:36:00.199 align:start position:0%
districts in neighboring states are
 
04:36:02.590 --> 04:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely under no obligation to accept
 
04:36:04.670 --> 04:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students unless there is
 
04:36:07.629 --> 04:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
already a contract in place and what
 
04:36:09.510 --> 04:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
happens to that
 
04:36:13.189 --> 04:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
contract on page one lines 23 and 27
 
04:36:15.349 --> 04:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
what's the definition of a program does
 
04:36:17.109 --> 04:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
this mean a student could apply to
 
04:36:20.670 --> 04:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
attend a school's Athletic program a CTE
 
04:36:23.109 --> 04:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
program an after school program is this
 
04:36:26.670 --> 04:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
like an alart selection that uh families
 
04:36:28.709 --> 04:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
and students can just choose from
 
04:36:31.349 --> 04:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
neighboring school districts for those
 
04:36:33.150 --> 04:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
parents who can't transport their
 
04:36:35.990 --> 04:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
students even across the line to to drop
 
04:36:38.551 --> 04:36:38.561 align:start position:0%
them at a bus stop doesn't this
 
04:36:41.551 --> 04:36:41.561 align:start position:0%
discriminate against them would the next
 
04:36:44.109 --> 04:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
fix that we would have to face be
 
04:36:47.670 --> 04:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
interdistrict Transportation or open
 
04:36:49.869 --> 04:36:49.879 align:start position:0%
Transportation do receiving districts
 
04:36:52.150 --> 04:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
have no say in who comes into their
 
04:36:54.949 --> 04:36:54.959 align:start position:0%
Schools page two lines seven and eight
 
04:36:56.990 --> 04:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
state that no receiving District shall
 
04:36:59.470 --> 04:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
reject an application with the only at
 
04:37:01.750 --> 04:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
caveats being lack of space or if the
 
04:37:04.551 --> 04:37:04.561 align:start position:0%
student's under suspension or expulsion
 
04:37:06.510 --> 04:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
if a school doesn't wish to participate
 
04:37:08.709 --> 04:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
in this program and States annually that
 
04:37:11.949 --> 04:37:11.959 align:start position:0%
they have no room does that satisfy that
 
04:37:14.429 --> 04:37:14.439 align:start position:0%
provision who determines the space or
 
04:37:16.629 --> 04:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
the capacity of the school the local
 
04:37:18.230 --> 04:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
school district the Department of
 
04:37:20.949 --> 04:37:20.959 align:start position:0%
Education the State Board of
 
04:37:23.150 --> 04:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
Education if receiving districts are
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
only receiving the adequacy payment plus
 
04:37:28.029 --> 04:37:28.039 align:start position:0%
any differentiated Aid doesn't the
 
04:37:29.670 --> 04:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
receiving District then bear the
 
04:37:31.510 --> 04:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
remainder of the cost of educating that
 
04:37:34.189 --> 04:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
non-resident student would that not
 
04:37:36.029 --> 04:37:36.039 align:start position:0%
impact the School District budget and
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
cause an increase in property
 
04:37:40.629 --> 04:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
taxes there are many questions that need
 
04:37:41.910 --> 04:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
to be answered just under the
 
04:37:45.070 --> 04:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
implementation section on page two lines
 
04:37:47.310 --> 04:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
23 to 25 state that the receiving
 
04:37:48.830 --> 04:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
District shall not be required to
 
04:37:51.590 --> 04:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
provide transportation it then goes on
 
04:37:53.230 --> 04:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
to say that the district must provide
 
04:37:55.709 --> 04:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
transportation to those students who are
 
04:37:58.269 --> 04:37:58.279 align:start position:0%
transported within the boundaries who
 
04:38:00.310 --> 04:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
pays for additional buses or bus stops
 
04:38:00.320 --> 04:38:01.109 align:start position:0%
pays for additional buses or bus stops
if

04:38:01.109 --> 04:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:38:04.510 --> 04:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
necessary on page two lines 31 to 32
 
04:38:06.830 --> 04:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
state that per pupil education grants
 
04:38:08.551 --> 04:38:08.561 align:start position:0%
shall be distributed plus any
 
04:38:11.551 --> 04:38:11.561 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid the differentiated
 
04:38:13.990 --> 04:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
Aid was established to help Local
 
04:38:16.510 --> 04:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
Schools provide programming and
 
04:38:19.189 --> 04:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
resources for a population of students
 
04:38:22.189 --> 04:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
who meet the statutory criteria not for
 
04:38:24.789 --> 04:38:24.799 align:start position:0%
each individual student so as a
 
04:38:26.590 --> 04:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
practical matter couldn't the loss of
 
04:38:28.670 --> 04:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
students in the Resident District affect
 
04:38:30.189 --> 04:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
the overall calculation of
 
04:38:32.150 --> 04:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid which would then
 
04:38:34.429 --> 04:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
lessen the adequacy grant going to the
 
04:38:36.670 --> 04:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
receiving District dist there are at
 
04:38:38.349 --> 04:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
least a dozen more questions that I
 
04:38:40.189 --> 04:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
haven't included in this
 
04:38:42.990 --> 04:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
testimony this bill is fraught with
 
04:38:45.949 --> 04:38:45.959 align:start position:0%
statutory inconsistencies and raises far
 
04:38:48.670 --> 04:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
more questions than it answers I would
 
04:38:51.470 --> 04:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
hope that if we truly wish to have a
 
04:38:54.109 --> 04:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
serious conversation about school choice
 
04:38:57.150 --> 04:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire then we should convene
 
04:38:59.150 --> 04:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
a study commission similar to the
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
funding commission to bring in experts
 
04:39:03.670 --> 04:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
from other states who have some of these
 
04:39:06.109 --> 04:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
policies in place already ready examine
 
04:39:09.551 --> 04:39:09.561 align:start position:0%
the potential fiscal in uh impacts and
 
04:39:13.269 --> 04:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
really look at um determining the future
 
04:39:15.949 --> 04:39:15.959 align:start position:0%
of public education in our state
 
04:39:18.551 --> 04:39:18.561 align:start position:0%
together rather than allowing National
 
04:39:21.629 --> 04:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
think tanks and political ideology uh to
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
rule the day this is a complex
 
04:39:27.429 --> 04:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
initiative when it's coupled with all
 
04:39:29.070 --> 04:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
the other choice legislation that's
 
04:39:31.150 --> 04:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
being proposed this session would
 
04:39:32.949 --> 04:39:32.959 align:start position:0%
drastically change the educational
 
04:39:35.189 --> 04:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
landscape in New Hampshire I've heard
 
04:39:36.910 --> 04:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
some legislators indicate that school
 
04:39:38.590 --> 04:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
choice is coming whether we like it or
 
04:39:41.670 --> 04:39:41.680 align:start position:0%
not if that's true and this is to be the
 
04:39:43.390 --> 04:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
future of public education in New
 
04:39:45.310 --> 04:39:45.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the nation that it should
 
04:39:48.270 --> 04:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
be incumbent on all policy leaders to
 
04:39:51.390 --> 04:39:51.400 align:start position:0%
look at this issue thoroughly
 
04:39:54.670 --> 04:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
holistically and in context you know I
 
04:39:56.470 --> 04:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
worked in Massachusetts which is often
 
04:39:58.350 --> 04:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
heralded as one of the champions of
 
04:40:00.510 --> 04:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
public school choice at least in New
 
04:40:03.110 --> 04:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
England there was a very thorough
 
04:40:05.550 --> 04:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
comprehensive examination of that policy
 
04:40:07.868 --> 04:40:07.878 align:start position:0%
change all the stakeholders were
 
04:40:09.948 --> 04:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
involved so that in order to make it
 
04:40:13.270 --> 04:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
work and Achieve buyin and support all
 
04:40:15.670 --> 04:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
the voices were heard and balances were
 
04:40:18.190 --> 04:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
struck to make the system work to the
 
04:40:20.430 --> 04:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
extent that it does I'm not supporting
 
04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts model in New Hampshire
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
but I'm not dismissing the notion
 
04:40:26.550 --> 04:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
altogether either but I do think our
 
04:40:28.750 --> 04:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
families and taxpayers deserve a more
 
04:40:31.190 --> 04:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and considerate examination
 
04:40:34.230 --> 04:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
of school choice before we careine down
 
04:40:36.270 --> 04:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
this particular particular path thank
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
you very much for your attention and I'd
 
04:40:40.788 --> 04:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
be glad to try to answer any questions
 
04:40:44.470 --> 04:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for uh Dr Lad
 
04:40:47.110 --> 04:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
represent M uh thank you Mr chair and
 
04:40:50.350 --> 04:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr Lad for taking my question
 
04:40:53.030 --> 04:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that in
 
04:40:55.030 --> 04:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they've had a school
 
04:40:59.590 --> 04:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
school choice program for over 25 years
 
04:41:01.590 --> 04:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
and that many of the questions that
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
you've raised are currently in the
 
04:41:08.990 --> 04:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
statute that provides Clarity on exactly
 
04:41:11.190 --> 04:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
how this program could be implemented is
 
04:41:13.708 --> 04:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct and one of
 
04:41:17.190 --> 04:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
the um one of the main elements that
 
04:41:20.390 --> 04:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
came from um that school choice
 
04:41:22.230 --> 04:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
discussion which was when Mitt Romney
 
04:41:23.788 --> 04:41:23.798 align:start position:0%
was the governor of
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um had to do with how uh
 
04:41:30.510 --> 04:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
School District governance was going to
 
04:41:33.948 --> 04:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
be handled in an era of school choice
 
04:41:36.510 --> 04:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
and and how could you make that work if
 
04:41:38.270 --> 04:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
you were truly going to make schools
 
04:41:40.708 --> 04:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
compete with one another and you wanted
 
04:41:42.628 --> 04:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
to use a business model then you needed
 
04:41:45.708 --> 04:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
to use a business model so what happened
 
04:41:48.270 --> 04:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
was the school board uh the school
 
04:41:49.948 --> 04:41:49.958 align:start position:0%
committees in Massachusetts are
 
04:41:53.510 --> 04:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
relegated to approving the budget
 
04:41:56.030 --> 04:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
overseeing the budget and hiring the
 
04:41:57.868 --> 04:41:57.878 align:start position:0%
superintendent that's
 
04:42:01.150 --> 04:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
it all of the other decisions relative
 
04:42:04.190 --> 04:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
to Personnel curriculum instruction
 
04:42:04.200 --> 04:42:05.070 align:start position:0%
to Personnel curriculum instruction
assess

04:42:05.070 --> 04:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
assess
 
04:42:08.190 --> 04:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
all of those decisions are made by the
 
04:42:10.350 --> 04:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
superintendent that's a very different
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
model than what we currently have that
 
04:42:17.708 --> 04:42:17.718 align:start position:0%
and in order to make school choice work
 
04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
that needed to happen um because you
 
04:42:23.230 --> 04:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
needed to take out some of the
 
04:42:25.830 --> 04:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking uh levels of authority I
 
04:42:27.190 --> 04:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
don't see that happening in New
 
04:42:29.830 --> 04:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I I really think that that
 
04:42:34.230 --> 04:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
creates a a real inconsistency with the
 
04:42:36.390 --> 04:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
only model in New England that really
 
04:42:40.430 --> 04:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
works followup please yes so you you
 
04:42:42.750 --> 04:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
raised an interesting issue here and
 
04:42:46.190 --> 04:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
that is where are the decisions made as
 
04:42:49.590 --> 04:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
relates to dealing with education if I'm
 
04:42:52.150 --> 04:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
hearing what you saying is that the role
 
04:42:55.190 --> 04:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education in
 
04:42:58.110 --> 04:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts plays a much more
 
04:43:01.910 --> 04:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
immediate and dominant role in education
 
04:43:04.270 --> 04:43:04.280 align:start position:0%
policy than they than it does currently
 
04:43:06.990 --> 04:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
in state is that correct that is very
 
04:43:09.990 --> 04:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
true I I can um one of the ways that I
 
04:43:13.430 --> 04:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
explained um the relationship with the
 
04:43:15.590 --> 04:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education uh in
 
04:43:18.150 --> 04:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts versus New Hampshire was
 
04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
if the commissioner of Education in
 
04:43:21.550 --> 04:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts called me and told me that
 
04:43:24.430 --> 04:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
I needed to do something I needed to do
 
04:43:26.868 --> 04:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
it when the commissioner of Education in
 
04:43:28.110 --> 04:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire called me as a
 
04:43:29.990 --> 04:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
superintendant to tell me I needed to do
 
04:43:31.948 --> 04:43:31.958 align:start position:0%
something I would tell him that I would
 
04:43:33.670 --> 04:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
take it under advisement because I
 
04:43:35.470 --> 04:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
needed to answer to my local school
 
04:43:39.190 --> 04:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
board who set the policy and hired me
 
04:43:40.990 --> 04:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
it's a very different it's a very
 
04:43:43.868 --> 04:43:43.878 align:start position:0%
different setup there are and there are
 
04:43:47.190 --> 04:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
hundreds of laws in Massachusetts that
 
04:43:50.430 --> 04:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
have been created in order to make
 
04:43:53.868 --> 04:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
school choice more effective and if you
 
04:43:55.990 --> 04:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
want to take a look at the most glaring
 
04:43:57.628 --> 04:43:57.638 align:start position:0%
difference it's the way in which
 
04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts funds their Public Schools
 
04:44:02.310 --> 04:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
as opposed to New Hampshire and that was
 
04:44:06.230 --> 04:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
also part of that large discussion about
 
04:44:06.240 --> 04:44:07.830 align:start position:0%
also part of that large discussion about
school

04:44:07.830 --> 04:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:44:10.590 --> 04:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
choice thank you are there further
 
04:44:12.750 --> 04:44:12.760 align:start position:0%

representative cordelli um I know you
 
04:44:47.190 --> 04:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
have another bill I'm going to be quick
 
04:44:49.190 --> 04:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
about this I think all the the concerns
 
04:44:52.910 --> 04:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
n hsba has um with the bill were um
 
04:44:55.190 --> 04:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
adequately and eloquently stated by Dr
 
04:44:57.990 --> 04:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
Lad um and also members of the committee
 
04:44:59.830 --> 04:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
um in their questions to representative
 
04:45:02.110 --> 04:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
cordelli um basically touched on the
 
04:45:04.910 --> 04:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
concerns that nhba has um in terms of
 
04:45:07.070 --> 04:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
funding um you know it seems that we're
 
04:45:09.628 --> 04:45:09.638 align:start position:0%
creating sort of a an inverse donor Town
 
04:45:11.948 --> 04:45:11.958 align:start position:0%
system if you will where if kids from
 
04:45:14.430 --> 04:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester leave to go to attend Bedford
 
04:45:15.910 --> 04:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
that Bedford is going to be paying for
 
04:45:18.110 --> 04:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
the for the education of of Manchester
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
students um a couple things that the
 
04:45:22.750 --> 04:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
bill does not um address um that have
 
04:45:25.150 --> 04:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
not actually been spoken on are capital
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
costs as well too um you know if if a
 
04:45:30.708 --> 04:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
school district needs to bond um for
 
04:45:33.110 --> 04:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
either a renovation or a new roof or
 
04:45:35.470 --> 04:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
whatnot um the local taxpayers is going
 
04:45:37.510 --> 04:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
to be paying for that bond to to to
 
04:45:38.948 --> 04:45:38.958 align:start position:0%
educate the children from another
 
04:45:41.110 --> 04:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
Community um which sort of the state
 
04:45:43.070 --> 04:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
adequacy a is not going to come close to
 
04:45:45.910 --> 04:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
covering um contracts uh tuition
 
04:45:47.510 --> 04:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
contracts have been addressed um
 
04:45:50.670 --> 04:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
capacity has been has been addressed um
 
04:45:52.190 --> 04:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
you know and who determines what that
 
04:45:54.150 --> 04:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
capacity is is it square footage or is
 
04:45:56.990 --> 04:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
it what that local school district has
 
04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
chosen um for their sort of P say uh
 
04:46:02.510 --> 04:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
student teacher ratios within their
 
04:46:05.150 --> 04:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
their Elementary School classes um I I
 
04:46:06.270 --> 04:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to talk about much of the
 
04:46:08.788 --> 04:46:08.798 align:start position:0%
bill um beyond that I I think all the
 
04:46:11.150 --> 04:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
the major points and concerns on hsba
 
04:46:14.270 --> 04:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
has have already been addressed but um I
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
I would like to say one thing
 
04:46:17.948 --> 04:46:17.958 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli you've mentioned
 
04:46:19.788 --> 04:46:19.798 align:start position:0%
zip code discrimination and I know
 
04:46:21.390 --> 04:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
you've used that phrase a couple times
 
04:46:24.150 --> 04:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
this session and and NH hsba agrees um
 
04:46:26.310 --> 04:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
that there is zip code discrimination
 
04:46:28.030 --> 04:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire I I think we
 
04:46:30.310 --> 04:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
disagree as to where that exists though
 
04:46:32.910 --> 04:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
from nhs's um Point of View zip code
 
04:46:35.070 --> 04:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
discrimination um with the Statewide
 
04:46:37.070 --> 04:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
education property Dex and the way in
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
which we fund our Public Schools um you
 
04:46:42.470 --> 04:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
know we know that Franklin and burlin
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
and Pittsfield and Claremont have a hard
 
04:46:47.070 --> 04:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
time um and you know and we know in
 
04:46:48.670 --> 04:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
Newport and we know if we look at some
 
04:46:50.430 --> 04:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
of the assessment tests they're their
 
04:46:52.390 --> 04:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
scores are not going to be as as high as
 
04:46:54.510 --> 04:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
you know some of the towns um that have
 
04:46:57.350 --> 04:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
greater property value so um you know we
 
04:46:59.190 --> 04:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
do agree that the code discrimination
 
04:47:01.070 --> 04:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
exists but again we think it's the way
 
04:47:02.910 --> 04:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
in which we fund our our fund our
 
04:47:05.190 --> 04:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire hopefully that
 
04:47:07.230 --> 04:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
we can sort of use this as the
 
04:47:09.708 --> 04:47:09.718 align:start position:0%
springboard to maybe look at that and
 
04:47:11.350 --> 04:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
and why that is and and follow up some
 
04:47:12.948 --> 04:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
of the work of the commission and and
 
04:47:14.350 --> 04:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully make some changes to the
 
04:47:16.628 --> 04:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
funding system in New Hampshire so so we
 
04:47:18.750 --> 04:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
can alleviate or lessen um you know
 
04:47:21.510 --> 04:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination based on based on on on
 
04:47:24.350 --> 04:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
property wealth and property taxes so uh
 
04:47:26.590 --> 04:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
with that um we're opposed to House Bill
 
04:47:29.788 --> 04:47:29.798 align:start position:0%
uh 4 uh 455 and I'm happy to take any
 
04:47:32.030 --> 04:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Barett are
 
04:47:38.030 --> 04:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:40.270 --> 04:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
Association I don't see any hands up
 
04:47:46.628 --> 04:47:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%

04:48:10.708 --> 04:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
thank thank you um can you hear me now
 
04:48:13.830 --> 04:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
sorry about that um just that was funny
 
04:48:15.390 --> 04:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
I just got kicked off when you moved me
 
04:48:19.110 --> 04:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
over so um I I don't have much more to
 
04:48:21.548 --> 04:48:21.558 align:start position:0%
uh say beyond what uh Barrett Christina
 
04:48:23.670 --> 04:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
just said I'm a member of the Ry School
 
04:48:25.270 --> 04:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
Board I've been on the Ry school board
 
04:48:28.390 --> 04:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
for eight years and Ry we're in a pretty
 
04:48:32.510 --> 04:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
privileged position uh we have uh
 
04:48:34.990 --> 04:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
property tax revenue and which to draw
 
04:48:38.310 --> 04:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that we uh we're not always
 
04:48:40.948 --> 04:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
watching the bottom line but this notion
 
04:48:43.868 --> 04:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
of of having kids uh basically just
 
04:48:47.070 --> 04:48:47.080 align:start position:0%
choose any school they could go it's not
 
04:48:49.510 --> 04:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
going to solve the property tax or the
 
04:48:52.110 --> 04:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
uh ZIP code discrimination which I agree
 
04:48:54.110 --> 04:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
with uh representative cordelli if
 
04:48:56.270 --> 04:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
that's a problem that we're trying to
 
04:48:59.150 --> 04:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
address there are structural ways to
 
04:49:00.910 --> 04:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
address that certainly our housing
 
04:49:02.948 --> 04:49:02.958 align:start position:0%
policies would be the first things and
 
04:49:04.430 --> 04:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
and opening up
 
04:49:07.310 --> 04:49:07.320 align:start position:0%
various towns to different kinds of
 
04:49:09.310 --> 04:49:09.320 align:start position:0%
affordable housing would be one of the
 
04:49:11.310 --> 04:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
ways to do that but to think that people
 
04:49:13.310 --> 04:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
are going to be driving their kids you
 
04:49:17.470 --> 04:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
know 20 30 50 miles is that's really
 
04:49:19.150 --> 04:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
setting up a different kind of privilege
 
04:49:20.868 --> 04:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
because not everybody has a chance to do
 
04:49:23.150 --> 04:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
that it's going to wreck havocs with
 
04:49:26.868 --> 04:49:26.878 align:start position:0%
local schools um so again all these
 
04:49:28.510 --> 04:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
bills that we've been talking about the
 
04:49:31.868 --> 04:49:31.878 align:start position:0%
past few weeks all seem designed to
 
04:49:34.030 --> 04:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
avoid dealing with the real problem and
 
04:49:36.510 --> 04:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
the real problem are the structural
 
04:49:38.628 --> 04:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
inequities built into our system of
 
04:49:41.310 --> 04:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
funding uh education here in New
 
04:49:43.948 --> 04:49:43.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I work across the country in
 
04:49:46.590 --> 04:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
education and I'm embarrassed to say
 
04:49:49.990 --> 04:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
that I think New Hampshire has the least
 
04:49:52.590 --> 04:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
Equitable funding system of any of the
 
04:49:54.190 --> 04:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
states and my organization Works in over
 
04:49:57.350 --> 04:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
40 States in any state where I work so
 
04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
let's deal with the real problem and
 
04:50:02.788 --> 04:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
stop trying to do these workarounds that
 
04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
are are going to exacerbate the
 
04:50:07.390 --> 04:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
inequities and wreck havoc with public
 
04:50:10.310 --> 04:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
education so I yield the rest of my time
 
04:50:12.590 --> 04:50:12.600 align:start position:0%

submit my written testimony and much of
 
04:51:11.830 --> 04:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
it has already been touched upon I'm
 
04:51:13.548 --> 04:51:13.558 align:start position:0%
here representing the special ed
 
04:51:15.990 --> 04:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
administrators Association and we are in
 
04:51:19.670 --> 04:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
opposition of the bill in my testimony I
 
04:51:23.230 --> 04:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
outlined um lots of questions that we uh
 
04:51:25.548 --> 04:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
are bringing forward some have already
 
04:51:29.350 --> 04:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
been uh brought to your attention um we
 
04:51:31.510 --> 04:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
categorized our questions into three
 
04:51:33.990 --> 04:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
different areas one was just around the
 
04:51:37.430 --> 04:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
general oversight and responsibility for
 
04:51:40.510 --> 04:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
special education services um as we
 
04:51:43.390 --> 04:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
pointed out in our testimony federal and
 
04:51:46.830 --> 04:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
state law requires school districts to
 
04:51:49.868 --> 04:51:49.878 align:start position:0%
um have IEP teams that make decisions
 
04:51:53.830 --> 04:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
around children's uh placements um and
 
04:51:56.030 --> 04:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
requires districts to place students in
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
the least restrictive environment
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
closest to their home this bill um is in
 
04:52:05.548 --> 04:52:05.558 align:start position:0%
direct conflict with that kind of um
 
04:52:08.390 --> 04:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
requirement on our school districts the
 
04:52:11.310 --> 04:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
bill also uh talks about the age ranges
 
04:52:15.030 --> 04:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
of kids um specifically mentions ages 5
 
04:52:17.470 --> 04:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
to 20 as all of you know special
 
04:52:21.190 --> 04:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
education requirements cover ages uh 3
 
04:52:25.070 --> 04:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
to 21 which again is a is a conflict in
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
terms of this bill the bill also speaks
 
04:52:29.948 --> 04:52:29.958 align:start position:0%
to making decisions around students
 
04:52:32.910 --> 04:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
being placed uh in choice schools that
 
04:52:35.110 --> 04:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
that has to be done in 10 days it's
 
04:52:37.190 --> 04:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible in the world of
 
04:52:39.788 --> 04:52:39.798 align:start position:0%
special education with the timelines and
 
04:52:42.070 --> 04:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
requirements and meetings that need to
 
04:52:44.948 --> 04:52:44.958 align:start position:0%
be held um they can't be done legally
 
04:52:48.470 --> 04:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
within um 10 days you also heard lots of
 
04:52:51.390 --> 04:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
questions around the expenses related to
 
04:52:51.400 --> 04:52:52.430 align:start position:0%
questions around the expenses related to
special

04:52:52.430 --> 04:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
special
 
04:52:55.830 --> 04:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
education and who's going to pay for uh
 
04:52:58.070 --> 04:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
the special education programming the
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
related Services the
 
04:53:03.030 --> 04:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
transportation that is not at all clear
 
04:53:05.948 --> 04:53:05.958 align:start position:0%
in this bill um the other things that we
 
04:53:08.590 --> 04:53:08.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned in terms of the criteria and
 
04:53:12.270 --> 04:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
the denial of school choice we raised
 
04:53:14.430 --> 04:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
questions it's not clear to us in terms
 
04:53:16.150 --> 04:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
of students with disabilities and
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not they could be denied
 
04:53:20.750 --> 04:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
school choice because of their placement
 
04:53:23.190 --> 04:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
you've heard about capacity in the world
 
04:53:25.670 --> 04:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
of special education there are legal
 
04:53:28.230 --> 04:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
requirements on the capacity of programs
 
04:53:30.948 --> 04:53:30.958 align:start position:0%
and the numbers of kids you can put in
 
04:53:33.628 --> 04:53:33.638 align:start position:0%
so our question is very similar to one
 
04:53:36.110 --> 04:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
that's already been brought forward if a
 
04:53:38.750 --> 04:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
classroom a special ed classroom is
 
04:53:41.030 --> 04:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
almost at capacity and a school choice
 
04:53:43.510 --> 04:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
student moves in and then you have two
 
04:53:45.788 --> 04:53:45.798 align:start position:0%
additional students move into their
 
04:53:48.270 --> 04:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
Hometown are those two students who
 
04:53:50.190 --> 04:53:50.200 align:start position:0%
moved in not allowed in their own
 
04:53:52.590 --> 04:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
resident school does the school choice
 
04:53:55.150 --> 04:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
student get bumped out does the school
 
04:53:58.230 --> 04:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
district have to the resident District
 
04:54:01.310 --> 04:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
have to take their resources to expand
 
04:54:04.230 --> 04:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
their program hire new staff
 
04:54:07.868 --> 04:54:07.878 align:start position:0%
uh find more space you heard um from car
 
04:54:09.990 --> 04:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
lad about just the monitoring and
 
04:54:12.190 --> 04:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
compliance requirements and who's
 
04:54:15.430 --> 04:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for all of that to ensure um
 
04:54:18.070 --> 04:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
that programs are in compliance with all
 
04:54:21.150 --> 04:54:21.160 align:start position:0%
the requirements and Reporting that's uh
 
04:54:24.590 --> 04:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
required under um state and federal law
 
04:54:27.110 --> 04:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
when it comes to special education so
 
04:54:29.510 --> 04:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
you did receive a full list of all of
 
04:54:32.830 --> 04:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
our questions um in summary we find that
 
04:54:35.708 --> 04:54:35.718 align:start position:0%
this bill um has so many flaws and so
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
many um unanswered questions we would
 
04:54:41.868 --> 04:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
ask that you uh oppose the bill and
 
04:54:43.750 --> 04:54:43.760 align:start position:0%

record my name is Rick lad I come from

havil New Hampshire and I'm speaking to
 
04:56:30.510 --> 04:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
HB 282 which deals with the uh tuition
 
04:56:32.990 --> 04:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
program that we currently have in place
 
04:56:36.990 --> 04:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
from the state um I'm looking at uh
 
04:56:40.628 --> 04:56:40.638 align:start position:0%
changing uh basically one word plus a
 
04:56:43.310 --> 04:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
few others throughout this entire bill I
 
04:56:46.868 --> 04:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
look first at 1931 col one which is
 
04:56:50.788 --> 04:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
under School attendance and we currently
 
04:56:53.750 --> 04:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
have in part D the child is attending a
 
04:56:55.868 --> 04:56:55.878 align:start position:0%
public or private school located in
 
04:57:00.150 --> 04:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
another state and or is attending a
 
04:57:02.390 --> 04:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
nonsectarian private school located in
 
04:57:04.750 --> 04:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that is approved as a
 
04:57:07.868 --> 04:57:07.878 align:start position:0%
school tuition program throughout this
 
04:57:12.990 --> 04:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
bill not just 1931 but 1933 col or Roman
 
04:57:17.510 --> 04:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
6 and seven 193 colon 4 liability for
 
04:57:20.548 --> 04:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
elementary junior high school tuition
 
04:57:24.830 --> 04:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
198 colum 24 estimates that are relative
 
04:57:29.750 --> 04:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
to cost 194 colum 27 regarding tuition
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
all regarding the tuition program
 
04:57:34.990 --> 04:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
basically the word non secretari and is
 
04:57:37.310 --> 04:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
being struck out and the word private
 
04:57:38.590 --> 04:57:38.600 align:start position:0%
school put
 
04:57:43.470 --> 04:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
in and this uh goes back to uh the issue
 
04:57:46.150 --> 04:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
of Education choice that we are have
 
04:57:48.788 --> 04:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
been debating most of today and some on
 
04:57:52.430 --> 04:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
previous days that and and and
 
04:57:56.150 --> 04:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
especially going right back to ca cacr 3
 
04:57:59.310 --> 04:57:59.320 align:start position:0%
from this morning uh where we discussed
 
04:58:01.628 --> 04:58:01.638 align:start position:0%
why are we discriminating against the
 
04:58:06.110 --> 04:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
religious school so at in this uh uh
 
04:58:09.470 --> 04:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
Bill we I have changed the I scratched
 
04:58:13.470 --> 04:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
nonsectarian and left it that a private
 
04:58:16.788 --> 04:58:16.798 align:start position:0%
school now secondly I do have an
 
04:58:18.788 --> 04:58:18.798 align:start position:0%
amendment that was sent out to everybody
 
04:58:20.310 --> 04:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
04:58:23.070 --> 04:58:23.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday and one of the the primary
 
04:58:25.788 --> 04:58:25.798 align:start position:0%
goals of that amendment in Roman
 
04:58:28.590 --> 04:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
six that would be on this original Bill
 
04:58:30.990 --> 04:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
starting on line nine and going down
 
04:58:34.150 --> 04:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
through line 15
 
04:58:35.910 --> 04:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
that the last portion would have the
 
04:58:37.788 --> 04:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
sentence the district May either assign
 
04:58:39.548 --> 04:58:39.558 align:start position:0%
all children to schools that have been
 
04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
approved as the school of tuition
 
04:58:44.510 --> 04:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
program and we have that happening in
 
04:58:46.788 --> 04:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
many school districts in the state this
 
04:58:50.470 --> 04:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
one southam me has a contract two Antion
 
04:58:53.070 --> 04:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
contracts with at least four separate
 
04:58:56.390 --> 04:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
districts in a small k through eight or
 
04:58:58.590 --> 04:58:58.600 align:start position:0%
allow each child's parent to choose the
 
04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
school from among those schools or
 
04:59:03.070 --> 04:59:03.080 align:start position:0%
schools that have been approved as a
 
04:59:06.110 --> 04:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
School tuition program so if that school
 
04:59:07.948 --> 04:59:07.958 align:start position:0%
district to the south of me has approved
 
04:59:10.750 --> 04:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
four contracts with differing school
 
04:59:12.708 --> 04:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
districts and the contract tuition
 
04:59:15.270 --> 04:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
rate's not the same for each school
 
04:59:16.948 --> 04:59:16.958 align:start position:0%
they're negotiating individually with
 
04:59:19.948 --> 04:59:19.958 align:start position:0%
each School District if a parent says
 
04:59:22.868 --> 04:59:22.878 align:start position:0%
well school districts one two and three
 
04:59:24.788 --> 04:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
don't really fit my child but i' like to
 
04:59:26.628 --> 04:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
have the vot to school district four
 
04:59:28.190 --> 04:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
that is written into this bill where
 
04:59:30.948 --> 04:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
that is that can be done in fact that is
 
04:59:32.590 --> 04:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
being done in some school districts
 
04:59:35.628 --> 04:59:35.638 align:start position:0%
right now by by putting it into law it's
 
04:59:38.030 --> 04:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
required that it's got to be considered
 
04:59:40.868 --> 04:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
and it offers that option to a parent
 
04:59:42.390 --> 04:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
and that's critical in many of these
 
04:59:44.510 --> 04:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
smaller towns where the parent best
 
04:59:48.350 --> 04:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
knows the child and and as familiar
 
04:59:50.030 --> 04:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
maybe with a school that might be closer
 
04:59:52.948 --> 04:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
to them or it be a school where a
 
04:59:56.230 --> 04:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
youngster is uh very interested in art
 
04:59:58.310 --> 04:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
or theater and there's one school that
 
05:00:00.548 --> 05:00:00.558 align:start position:0%
might offer a wonderful theater program
 
05:00:02.310 --> 05:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
or another school might offer a
 
05:00:03.990 --> 05:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
different program that's what we're
 
05:00:06.150 --> 05:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
doing with this Contracting right now
 
05:00:08.628 --> 05:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
throughout this state and parents are
 
05:00:11.430 --> 05:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
enjoying it and 70% of our parents when
 
05:00:14.510 --> 05:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
they're they're ped enjoy the option of
 
05:00:17.510 --> 05:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
having this choice and this opportunity
 
05:00:20.990 --> 05:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
to tuition their students to a school
 
05:00:22.628 --> 05:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
and and where they don't have those
 
05:00:26.230 --> 05:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
grades in the Resident District so I I I
 
05:00:30.030 --> 05:00:30.040 align:start position:0%
see this as a step forward um I believe
 
05:00:33.270 --> 05:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing to do it offers us
 
05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh a better degree of school options
 
05:00:38.548 --> 05:00:38.558 align:start position:0%
that might be affordable or from a
 
05:00:41.350 --> 05:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
school district perspective often times
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
and sometimes the tuition rate to some
 
05:00:45.590 --> 05:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
of these small private schools is less
 
05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
than it is to the larger school
 
05:00:51.430 --> 05:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
district and so in the top line of line
 
05:00:52.990 --> 05:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
three of this it says the child is
 
05:00:55.868 --> 05:00:55.878 align:start position:0%
attending a public or private school
 
05:00:58.110 --> 05:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
there's no se some nonsectarian school
 
05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
on that line says private
 
05:01:03.548 --> 05:01:03.558 align:start position:0%
school and I believe strong that that
 
05:01:05.070 --> 05:01:05.080 align:start position:0%
should be the case throughout our
 
05:01:08.110 --> 05:01:08.120 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you very much and I I
 
05:01:10.230 --> 05:01:10.240 align:start position:0%

05:01:14.070 --> 05:01:14.080 align:start position:0%

Tanner yes uh thank you for taking my
 
05:02:54.350 --> 05:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
question um I'm just
 
05:02:58.470 --> 05:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
wondering uh if if um you know we had
 
05:03:02.270 --> 05:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
the the um Constitutional Amendment this
 
05:03:02.280 --> 05:03:03.270 align:start position:0%
the the um Constitutional Amendment this
morning

05:03:03.270 --> 05:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
morning
 
05:03:05.390 --> 05:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
talking about the Blain
 
05:03:08.430 --> 05:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
amendment I guess can you hear me okay
 
05:03:13.390 --> 05:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
yes um and also um you know article six
 
05:03:15.430 --> 05:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh that says that no person shall ever
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
be compelled to pay towards the support
 
05:03:20.510 --> 05:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
of the schools of any sect or
 
05:03:22.788 --> 05:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
denomination that wouldn't it be more
 
05:03:27.708 --> 05:03:27.718 align:start position:0%
prudent to wait until we see how uh the
 
05:03:29.548 --> 05:03:29.558 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment plays out
 
05:03:31.750 --> 05:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
before we uh jump into this because
 
05:03:34.510 --> 05:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
won't this provoke just uh
 
05:03:37.430 --> 05:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
lawsuits well this this at presently
 
05:03:39.548 --> 05:03:39.558 align:start position:0%
this particular area of Statute that
 
05:03:44.990 --> 05:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the 193 198 194 areas
 
05:03:47.788 --> 05:03:47.798 align:start position:0%
um address not the state making this
 
05:03:49.948 --> 05:03:49.958 align:start position:0%
decision this is a local school board
 
05:03:52.230 --> 05:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
decision they're the ones that
 
05:03:55.590 --> 05:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
approve uh not the state so um it's
 
05:03:58.750 --> 05:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
still uh it it say within legislation
 
05:04:00.990 --> 05:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
the the school district made so this is
 
05:04:03.110 --> 05:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
an option available it's not saying you
 
05:04:06.548 --> 05:04:06.558 align:start position:0%
shall ass say you may so uh I would
 
05:04:08.788 --> 05:04:08.798 align:start position:0%
assume then that if it's a decision that
 
05:04:10.670 --> 05:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
the local school district makes and
 
05:04:13.830 --> 05:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
wants to go forward with and contrary to
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
what they have in Massachusetts this is
 
05:04:17.868 --> 05:04:17.878 align:start position:0%
a local control
 
05:04:20.750 --> 05:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
state may I have a followup on that yes
 
05:04:23.230 --> 05:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
you may um doesn't that put the local
 
05:04:25.548 --> 05:04:25.558 align:start position:0%
school board at risk of a lawsuit then
 
05:04:28.548 --> 05:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
if uh again we're we're talking about
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire constitution in two
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
separate places and and possible
 
05:04:35.430 --> 05:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and to the fact that we need a
 
05:04:37.750 --> 05:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
resolution well represent this is a
 
05:04:44.270 --> 05:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
lawyers world and I guess anything we do
 
05:04:47.670 --> 05:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
is up for up for grab so uh in today's
 
05:04:51.190 --> 05:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
society we're kind of a su happy Society
 
05:04:53.470 --> 05:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
um I would hope that anybody that looks
 
05:04:56.430 --> 05:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
at this would first look at what is the
 
05:05:01.230 --> 05:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
best uh education environment available
 
05:05:04.590 --> 05:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
for this child and I know where I am
 
05:05:07.868 --> 05:05:07.878 align:start position:0%
right now we don't have choice at all we
 
05:05:11.310 --> 05:05:11.320 align:start position:0%
don't have a charter school uh we have
 
05:05:14.430 --> 05:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh basically no private schools near us
 
05:05:16.548 --> 05:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
St Jay Academy is the only one but
 
05:05:19.788 --> 05:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
that's like 35 40 miles up the road and
 
05:05:22.070 --> 05:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
a tuition is you know
 
05:05:25.470 --> 05:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
expensive and transportation's difficult
 
05:05:27.470 --> 05:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh so it's not really an option we have
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
one private school down in Li New
 
05:05:32.430 --> 05:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it's full we have several
 
05:05:34.230 --> 05:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
Church schools around that are starting
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
to open up their doors given the the
 
05:05:38.190 --> 05:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
situation we're encountering now with
 
05:05:41.708 --> 05:05:41.718 align:start position:0%
the pandemic um and but the way it's
 
05:05:45.510 --> 05:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
written right now that's not a viable
 
05:05:50.628 --> 05:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:50.638 --> 05:05:53.548 align:start position:0%
 
question

05:05:53.548 --> 05:05:53.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:05:59.708 --> 05:05:59.718 align:start position:0%
she uh thank you um so you know um I
 
05:06:03.548 --> 05:06:03.558 align:start position:0%
guess the the issue is that maybe uh
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
what we need to do is put Charter
 
05:06:09.470 --> 05:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
Schools a charter school uh in each
 
05:06:13.110 --> 05:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
County or each region so that we have
 
05:06:17.070 --> 05:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
options that way uh because the
 
05:06:20.030 --> 05:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution protects the taxpayer
 
05:06:22.868 --> 05:06:22.878 align:start position:0%
protects the person who is paying for
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
the the sectarian school to um promote
 
05:06:33.030 --> 05:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
their religion uh and I think um that
 
05:06:35.948 --> 05:06:35.958 align:start position:0%
that uh that's that's the case don't
 
05:06:38.230 --> 05:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
don't you think that it it this
 
05:06:40.910 --> 05:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
particular uh Constitutional Amendment
 
05:06:43.470 --> 05:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
um and or constitutional article
 
05:06:46.390 --> 05:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
protects the taxpayer I think that what
 
05:06:49.868 --> 05:06:49.878 align:start position:0%
I prefer look at is that our statutes uh
 
05:06:51.070 --> 05:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
say that we should provide the
 
05:06:52.830 --> 05:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for all children to receive
 
05:06:54.110 --> 05:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
an adequate
 
05:06:57.190 --> 05:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
education and in in some places in our
 
05:07:00.390 --> 05:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
state here that can't be provided given
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
a whole host of reasons number one uh
 
05:07:06.270 --> 05:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
the economics of the environment and the
 
05:07:09.110 --> 05:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
availability of options uh and there's
 
05:07:11.270 --> 05:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely no competition so I would
 
05:07:13.070 --> 05:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
always take and put the child first and
 
05:07:15.030 --> 05:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
say what's the best option for the child
 
05:07:18.070 --> 05:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine anybody wanting to deny
 
05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
a child and education I for example when
 
05:07:23.910 --> 05:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
I moved up from Kentucky to Rhode Island
 
05:07:26.750 --> 05:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
I was a full year behind uh where the
 
05:07:29.230 --> 05:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
public schools in Rhode Island were my
 
05:07:31.590 --> 05:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
parents decided me send me to St Dunston
 
05:07:34.830 --> 05:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
School St dunon is located in Province
 
05:07:38.708 --> 05:07:38.718 align:start position:0%
rhod and it's an Episcopalian run school
 
05:07:41.150 --> 05:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
well you know everybody knows that I you
 
05:07:43.270 --> 05:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
know I'm one of those persons that yes I
 
05:07:45.270 --> 05:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
believe in religion but I'm very rarely
 
05:07:49.590 --> 05:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
in church um uh my my mother was a
 
05:07:51.230 --> 05:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
deaconness in the Presbyterian church
 
05:07:53.070 --> 05:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
and congregational churches my
 
05:07:56.270 --> 05:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
grandfather the same yet um when we went
 
05:07:59.470 --> 05:07:59.480 align:start position:0%
to St Dunston's there was no no religion
 
05:08:02.470 --> 05:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
taught to me at all it was basically
 
05:08:05.830 --> 05:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
really I yes I had Latin uh and I was
 
05:08:07.910 --> 05:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
able to catch up but that provided me an
 
05:08:10.350 --> 05:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
environment to meet my speeds right if I
 
05:08:12.230 --> 05:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
gone off to the Middle School in war
 
05:08:15.910 --> 05:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island I would have never CAU up
 
05:08:17.670 --> 05:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh it was just overwhelming I'd never
 
05:08:20.230 --> 05:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
seen anything so large in my life it's a
 
05:08:23.390 --> 05:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
factory and I you know so I think
 
05:08:26.868 --> 05:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
there's times when we need to have this
 
05:08:29.230 --> 05:08:29.240 align:start position:0%
available and I leave it to our local
 
05:08:31.030 --> 05:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
school boards to make the decision
 
05:08:33.190 --> 05:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's proper and right working with the
 
05:08:35.190 --> 05:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
parent thank
 
05:08:38.310 --> 05:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you um any further questions
 
05:08:41.110 --> 05:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Mullen
 
05:08:43.150 --> 05:08:43.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr uh thank you representative
 
05:08:44.708 --> 05:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
cordelli and thank you representative
 
05:08:48.430 --> 05:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
Vlad for taking another question um so I
 
05:08:50.310 --> 05:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
I I I have to admit I I'm a little
 
05:08:52.030 --> 05:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
thrown by not having the amendment in
 
05:08:54.070 --> 05:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
front of me because my questions are
 
05:08:55.948 --> 05:08:55.958 align:start position:0%
based on what I think I know not
 
05:09:00.990 --> 05:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily what I do know um but let me
 
05:09:05.310 --> 05:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
just clarify something so you are
 
05:09:07.910 --> 05:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
according to this bill are proposing
 
05:09:12.430 --> 05:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
that a school board would be able to
 
05:09:14.948 --> 05:09:14.958 align:start position:0%
authorize a child or make a
 
05:09:18.788 --> 05:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
determination that a child's educational
 
05:09:22.548 --> 05:09:22.558 align:start position:0%
needs are better served at a local
 
05:09:25.868 --> 05:09:25.878 align:start position:0%
religious school I I'm saying that a
 
05:09:27.670 --> 05:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
school board that doesn't have for
 
05:09:30.750 --> 05:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
example grade S8 on up to 12 in their
 
05:09:33.868 --> 05:09:33.878 align:start position:0%
school district that's going to have to
 
05:09:36.510 --> 05:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
the kids out somewhere would have this
 
05:09:39.430 --> 05:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
as one of the options to contract with
 
05:09:42.750 --> 05:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
and then the the that those choices you
 
05:09:43.990 --> 05:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
may have four or five different
 
05:09:45.910 --> 05:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
districts available to parents as we do
 
05:09:47.510 --> 05:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the state right now for a number of
 
05:09:50.470 --> 05:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
small districts that would be an option
 
05:09:53.070 --> 05:09:53.080 align:start position:0%
available for the parents to work with
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
that school district and say I think
 
05:09:57.548 --> 05:09:57.558 align:start position:0%
Susan really would do best in in this
 
05:09:57.558 --> 05:09:59.070 align:start position:0%
Susan really would do best in in this
particular

05:09:59.070 --> 05:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:10:02.310 --> 05:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
School are a followup question represent
 
05:10:04.990 --> 05:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
of cordelli thank you um are you at all
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
worried about personal bias in the
 
05:10:07.600 --> 05:10:09.590 align:start position:0%
worried about personal bias in the
decision

05:10:09.590 --> 05:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:10:12.628 --> 05:10:12.638 align:start position:0%
making personal bias upon who
 
05:10:16.310 --> 05:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
represen uh personal bias in local
 
05:10:17.510 --> 05:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
school board
 
05:10:21.030 --> 05:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
members not feeling that they want to
 
05:10:24.628 --> 05:10:24.638 align:start position:0%
send local students to uh the Episcopal
 
05:10:27.948 --> 05:10:27.958 align:start position:0%
School the Jewish Community Center
 
05:10:33.030 --> 05:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
Saints somewhere um are you what's the
 
05:10:35.230 --> 05:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
what's the plan
 
05:10:40.030 --> 05:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
for making sure that people are in
 
05:10:43.230 --> 05:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
fact not personally biased when they're
 
05:10:45.948 --> 05:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
making these decisions well first of all
 
05:10:48.150 --> 05:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
the the local school boards the ones
 
05:10:50.830 --> 05:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
going to have to set these contracts up
 
05:10:52.750 --> 05:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to contract with the
 
05:10:52.760 --> 05:10:53.830 align:start position:0%
they're going to contract with the
sending

05:10:53.830 --> 05:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
sending
 
05:10:56.190 --> 05:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
districts uh and then when they have
 
05:10:58.070 --> 05:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
that list of districts we're just I'm
 
05:10:59.788 --> 05:10:59.798 align:start position:0%
just throwing in in this Bild the option
 
05:11:03.310 --> 05:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
where they can contract with a private
 
05:11:06.350 --> 05:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh religious school if they have to or a
 
05:11:09.708 --> 05:11:09.718 align:start position:0%
private uh you know school like
 
05:11:12.030 --> 05:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
pness or or some other school that's in
 
05:11:13.628 --> 05:11:13.638 align:start position:0%
our state that's a small private school
 
05:11:16.270 --> 05:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
or Monas school as they've done down in
 
05:11:19.948 --> 05:11:19.958 align:start position:0%
Cy um then it's up to the parent to work
 
05:11:21.868 --> 05:11:21.878 align:start position:0%
with the school but this the way the
 
05:11:24.230 --> 05:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
legislation says in the amendment I'm
 
05:11:26.470 --> 05:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
sorry you don't have it in front of you
 
05:11:28.390 --> 05:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
it would say or allow each child's
 
05:11:30.190 --> 05:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
parent to choose a school from among
 
05:11:32.110 --> 05:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
schools that have been approved as
 
05:11:34.788 --> 05:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
School tuition program so then the
 
05:11:37.270 --> 05:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
choice would be handed to the parent and
 
05:11:39.948 --> 05:11:39.958 align:start position:0%
here's five schools who contracted wood
 
05:11:41.708 --> 05:11:41.718 align:start position:0%
and here's the strengths and weaknesses
 
05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
what all these schools and the programs
 
05:11:46.670 --> 05:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
that are offered um parent we'd love to
 
05:11:48.590 --> 05:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
hear what your thoughts are on that and
 
05:11:50.548 --> 05:11:50.558 align:start position:0%
and and help us make that choice in fact
 
05:11:52.310 --> 05:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
the parent should be allowed to make
 
05:11:55.430 --> 05:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
that choice because the to prob in most
 
05:11:57.510 --> 05:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
cases the transportation is going to be
 
05:12:00.030 --> 05:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
on the shoulders of the the
 
05:12:02.868 --> 05:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
parent and so would the liability of
 
05:12:04.990 --> 05:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
success or failure also be with the
 
05:12:08.470 --> 05:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
parent the the liability is in statute
 
05:12:09.708 --> 05:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
there when you're looking at the
 
05:12:11.830 --> 05:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
liability District liability for
 
05:12:14.030 --> 05:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
elementary junior high school tuition
 
05:12:17.910 --> 05:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's spelled out in law
 
05:12:20.030 --> 05:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
already thank
 
05:12:22.990 --> 05:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
you any further questions of chairman
 
05:12:26.110 --> 05:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:28.510 --> 05:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and
 
05:12:30.470 --> 05:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative lad
 
05:12:33.190 --> 05:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm looking on
 
05:12:35.788 --> 05:12:35.798 align:start position:0%
the um and and I I did see the amendment
 
05:12:39.230 --> 05:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
arrive um I think um Miss for uh emailed
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
it around to the to the committee but
 
05:12:45.190 --> 05:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
referring back to the um to the bill is
 
05:12:49.030 --> 05:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
introduced on page one lines 29 and 30
 
05:12:52.948 --> 05:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
where you refer to um contracted um no
 
05:12:55.590 --> 05:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
be a school approved and contracted by a
 
05:12:57.470 --> 05:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
local public school board to provide
 
05:12:59.510 --> 05:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
students with the opportunity for an
 
05:13:02.190 --> 05:13:02.200 align:start position:0%
adequate education does that opportunity
 
05:13:04.948 --> 05:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education basically um
 
05:13:08.628 --> 05:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
is that shorthand for including all
 
05:13:11.350 --> 05:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
obligations and requirements and due
 
05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
process um provisions and everything
 
05:13:18.510 --> 05:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
that a um that a public school would
 
05:13:22.510 --> 05:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise have um be obligated to um to
 
05:13:25.990 --> 05:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
provide um uh students that it
 
05:13:28.670 --> 05:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
serves I would reference back to when
 
05:13:30.190 --> 05:13:30.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the opportunity for
 
05:13:32.670 --> 05:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
an adequate education we you know we'
 
05:13:35.948 --> 05:13:35.958 align:start position:0%
looked at often up there underneath the
 
05:13:37.948 --> 05:13:37.958 align:start position:0%
definition of what an adequate education
 
05:13:39.750 --> 05:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
is and sub
 
05:13:42.230 --> 05:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
193e me in
 
05:13:47.070 --> 05:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
193e yeah yeah yeah yeah and and um I'm
 
05:13:50.270 --> 05:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not trying to scoot around a quality
 
05:13:53.230 --> 05:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
education or scoot around standards I'm
 
05:13:56.948 --> 05:13:56.958 align:start position:0%
just trying to provide that option where
 
05:13:59.230 --> 05:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
we need some options and places in the
 
05:14:02.310 --> 05:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
state where um either space is available
 
05:14:04.030 --> 05:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
in some of them and there might be space
 
05:14:06.150 --> 05:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
available in another or there's a a
 
05:14:07.910 --> 05:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
school there available and that's the
 
05:14:09.868 --> 05:14:09.878 align:start position:0%
only other option available other than
 
05:14:11.628 --> 05:14:11.638 align:start position:0%
homeschooling and I've been through
 
05:14:13.270 --> 05:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
homeschooling for the last two months
 
05:14:15.670 --> 05:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
here or three months and let me tell you
 
05:14:18.548 --> 05:14:18.558 align:start position:0%
I don't want to do it again um I you
 
05:14:20.750 --> 05:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
know it's it's probably why I Stumble
 
05:14:22.628 --> 05:14:22.638 align:start position:0%
here sometimes I'm
 
05:14:26.590 --> 05:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
tired and so and being a teacher is not
 
05:14:29.070 --> 05:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
an easy task and you know I was one I
 
05:14:32.310 --> 05:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
was younger then and it was fun but now
 
05:14:34.270 --> 05:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
it's fun but it's also exhausting
 
05:14:35.990 --> 05:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
running around trying to KCK up with
 
05:14:38.030 --> 05:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
somebody's Middle School Age
 
05:14:41.270 --> 05:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
kid so I I'm looking for all these
 
05:14:44.750 --> 05:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
available options and I think that uh
 
05:14:47.150 --> 05:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
I've seen religious schools that are not
 
05:14:49.830 --> 05:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
advocating religion in the classroom my
 
05:14:51.590 --> 05:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
Lord we we made bird houses and
 
05:14:53.310 --> 05:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
everything else in that Episcopalian
 
05:14:55.230 --> 05:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
school um they weren't only for
 
05:14:57.948 --> 05:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
religious Birds they were for everybody
 
05:15:03.390 --> 05:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
and and so right but but
 
05:15:05.948 --> 05:15:05.958 align:start position:0%
Rick the the the questions the
 
05:15:08.350 --> 05:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
question's going to not not whether or
 
05:15:10.788 --> 05:15:10.798 align:start position:0%
not you choose to attend a religious
 
05:15:13.310 --> 05:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
school but in the case where a public
 
05:15:16.230 --> 05:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
school um that doesn't have a school
 
05:15:19.590 --> 05:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
that serves certain grades contracts
 
05:15:22.150 --> 05:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
with a private school to fulfill its
 
05:15:26.110 --> 05:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
Public School obligations and I just was
 
05:15:28.310 --> 05:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
the the question goes to do all those
 
05:15:31.628 --> 05:15:31.638 align:start position:0%
Public School obligations travel under
 
05:15:35.150 --> 05:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
contract to to this contracted private
 
05:15:37.350 --> 05:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
school or is it just some of the public
 
05:15:39.470 --> 05:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
schools I think that you're getting the
 
05:15:40.948 --> 05:15:40.958 align:start position:0%
things for example like we talked about
 
05:15:43.830 --> 05:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
over in go where they have contracts
 
05:15:45.548 --> 05:15:45.558 align:start position:0%
with maybe four or five different
 
05:15:48.830 --> 05:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
schools some schools can
 
05:15:52.350 --> 05:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
offer programs that other schools cannot
 
05:15:53.990 --> 05:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
and we have that happening in other
 
05:15:57.868 --> 05:15:57.878 align:start position:0%
school districts as well and so the and
 
05:15:59.670 --> 05:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
we've gone down this road with special
 
05:16:02.030 --> 05:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
education services we know that there's
 
05:16:04.270 --> 05:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
some situations where special education
 
05:16:06.910 --> 05:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
may not be done the same way you may see
 
05:16:08.990 --> 05:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
it done in the public school with the
 
05:16:11.350 --> 05:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
with the the IEP process and all the
 
05:16:14.030 --> 05:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations others many
 
05:16:17.708 --> 05:16:17.718 align:start position:0%
private schools uh choose to direct uh
 
05:16:19.868 --> 05:16:19.878 align:start position:0%
Supportive Services in a different
 
05:16:22.350 --> 05:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
manner uh than they do and I don't me to
 
05:16:23.868 --> 05:16:23.878 align:start position:0%
go through that now I think you're aware
 
05:16:27.350 --> 05:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
of that um and how that occurs um and
 
05:16:29.470 --> 05:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
it's effective for some kids I'm not
 
05:16:31.110 --> 05:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
saying it's effective for all kids and
 
05:16:33.590 --> 05:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's where the parent be allowed to
 
05:16:35.190 --> 05:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
make this choice and you're going to
 
05:16:37.670 --> 05:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
make this Choice based upon the
 
05:16:39.990 --> 05:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
resources and the program Mak going be
 
05:16:43.070 --> 05:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
provided in that individual
 
05:16:45.990 --> 05:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
situation yeah and a followup and I
 
05:16:47.670 --> 05:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
promise this is my last
 
05:16:52.990 --> 05:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
one um so representative lad um um the
 
05:16:55.470 --> 05:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
the the line that I was referring to is
 
05:16:58.868 --> 05:16:58.878 align:start position:0%
in Roman 7 which is uh an approved
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
School tuition
 
05:17:04.510 --> 05:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
program um so it's a program that's
 
05:17:07.390 --> 05:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
been approved by the local school board
 
05:17:11.470 --> 05:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
as you've as you've pointed out um
 
05:17:17.470 --> 05:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
to provide um you know to to to provide
 
05:17:20.150 --> 05:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
um students for the opportunity for that
 
05:17:22.350 --> 05:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
for for the students that that it serves
 
05:17:24.390 --> 05:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it has to be the same as
 
05:17:26.510 --> 05:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
as another program and I I certainly
 
05:17:27.510 --> 05:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
understand different schools do
 
05:17:28.788 --> 05:17:28.798 align:start position:0%
different things not everybody has
 
05:17:30.830 --> 05:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
football programs not everybody has
 
05:17:33.830 --> 05:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
robotics teams um and not everybody not
 
05:17:35.990 --> 05:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
every school district provides the same
 
05:17:38.628 --> 05:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
the exact same um special education
 
05:17:40.990 --> 05:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
services but but with the
 
05:17:43.510 --> 05:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that the public school
 
05:17:46.310 --> 05:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
I mean with the with the with the with
 
05:17:49.910 --> 05:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
the school that that is contracted by
 
05:17:54.350 --> 05:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
the public school have the same
 
05:17:56.030 --> 05:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
responsibilities they have the
 
05:17:58.350 --> 05:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as required by that
 
05:18:01.030 --> 05:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
school board that's approving them and
 
05:18:02.750 --> 05:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
if you look back at the original
 
05:18:04.990 --> 05:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
tryonville and that language which we
 
05:18:09.190 --> 05:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
had it specifies how that is to be done
 
05:18:13.110 --> 05:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you very much um I don't

05:18:47.948 --> 05:18:47.958 align:start position:0%
support for this bill I was not able to
 
05:18:50.708 --> 05:18:50.718 align:start position:0%
be present this morning um when you were
 
05:18:52.270 --> 05:18:52.280 align:start position:0%
discussing the repeal of the Blain
 
05:18:54.070 --> 05:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment so some of what I'm going to
 
05:18:56.110 --> 05:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
say now which is in addition to my
 
05:18:57.590 --> 05:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
written testimony you likely already
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
heard I would just encourage you all to
 
05:19:01.948 --> 05:19:01.958 align:start position:0%
make sure you visit
 
05:19:03.830 --> 05:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
um there are three cases at the federal
 
05:19:06.350 --> 05:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
level which establish um the
 
05:19:10.070 --> 05:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of sending students to
 
05:19:11.868 --> 05:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
what we're calling sectarian or I would
 
05:19:14.150 --> 05:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
call a religious school that's zelman
 
05:19:15.910 --> 05:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
versus Simmons Harris that's the voucher
 
05:19:18.190 --> 05:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
program over in the state of Ohio that's
 
05:19:20.948 --> 05:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
Trin Lutheran versus comr and then the
 
05:19:23.150 --> 05:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
more recent Espinosa versus
 
05:19:27.590 --> 05:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
Montana I think in esposa versus Montana
 
05:19:30.150 --> 05:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
we found that there are two sides of
 
05:19:32.350 --> 05:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
that first um First Amendment there's
 
05:19:34.390 --> 05:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
the free exercise and then the
 
05:19:36.830 --> 05:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
non-establishment clause and I think
 
05:19:38.310 --> 05:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
we're kind of living in times right now
 
05:19:40.190 --> 05:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
where we put that divisive line between
 
05:19:42.430 --> 05:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
the two and we can't see the Nuance that
 
05:19:45.510 --> 05:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
you can do both at the same time which
 
05:19:47.310 --> 05:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
uh at least here in chairman lad I think
 
05:19:48.990 --> 05:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
this is trying to accomplish that by
 
05:19:51.310 --> 05:19:51.320 align:start position:0%
giving parents the choice uh for the
 
05:19:53.310 --> 05:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
education of their children and then the
 
05:19:54.350 --> 05:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
only other point that I would make
 
05:19:55.830 --> 05:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
without taking up too much of your time
 
05:19:57.628 --> 05:19:57.638 align:start position:0%
is I I just want to make this argument
 
05:19:59.990 --> 05:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
as the leader of a religious school um
 
05:20:01.708 --> 05:20:01.718 align:start position:0%
after hearing especially representative
 
05:20:03.190 --> 05:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
Tanner saying that religious schools
 
05:20:05.470 --> 05:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
just want to propagate the faith I would
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
argue that religious schools just like
 
05:20:10.150 --> 05:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
public schools have the good of the
 
05:20:12.430 --> 05:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
child as their sole objective and
 
05:20:15.628 --> 05:20:15.638 align:start position:0%
nothing else and I thank you for your
 
05:20:19.350 --> 05:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
time uh thank you very much Mr chle um
 
05:20:22.070 --> 05:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
any questions take questions y y
 
05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
05:20:29.430 --> 05:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:32.070 --> 05:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
lunar thank you very much Mr chairman
 
05:20:35.628 --> 05:20:35.638 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much um Mr tremble um
 
05:20:38.190 --> 05:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
do does the the school that you head up
 
05:20:41.430 --> 05:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
um currently take um special education
 
05:20:44.628 --> 05:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
students uh yes sir and and a followup
 
05:20:47.948 --> 05:20:47.958 align:start position:0%
on that yes sir do do parents have a um
 
05:20:50.990 --> 05:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
a due process right uh to um to
 
05:20:53.910 --> 05:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
challenge I mean a due process right to
 
05:20:57.510 --> 05:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
to contest um the
 
05:21:00.310 --> 05:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
IEP yes sir yeah as far as I know even
 
05:21:02.390 --> 05:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
though they parentally placed I think
 
05:21:04.990 --> 05:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
you've probably heard this before they
 
05:21:08.590 --> 05:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
still are under you know Ida entitled to
 
05:21:10.190 --> 05:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
all those
 
05:21:14.070 --> 05:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
rights um I I think we could get some
 
05:21:17.670 --> 05:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
clarification on that I don't and I
 
05:21:19.110 --> 05:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
maybe I can understand your question
 
05:21:20.788 --> 05:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
better what do you mean by protest
 
05:21:22.430 --> 05:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
representatively I didn't say protest I
 
05:21:25.510 --> 05:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
said due process due process and and
 
05:21:28.150 --> 05:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
it's a it it's actually a right for for
 
05:21:31.910 --> 05:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
due process that um it's it's not it's
 
05:21:33.990 --> 05:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
not just whether or not the school wants
 
05:21:37.270 --> 05:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
to allow the parents to meet with the
 
05:21:39.990 --> 05:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
board or something like that to to
 
05:21:42.868 --> 05:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
discuss um their their child but it's
 
05:21:45.310 --> 05:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
actually a right toh to do that and I
 
05:21:47.628 --> 05:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
think my understanding from from prior
 
05:21:49.590 --> 05:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
testimony not on this bill but on
 
05:21:51.910 --> 05:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
another bill is that when a when a when
 
05:21:54.990 --> 05:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
a a when a student exits their Public
 
05:21:58.628 --> 05:21:58.638 align:start position:0%
School District they they also leave
 
05:22:03.110 --> 05:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:06.110 --> 05:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
um I I think that I think they forfeit
 
05:22:08.990 --> 05:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
their their idea rights would you mind
 
05:22:10.430 --> 05:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
if I just speak to my experience and
 
05:22:12.310 --> 05:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
that could be helpful here given maybe
 
05:22:14.430 --> 05:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
we're both a little unsure but I can
 
05:22:15.910 --> 05:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
just tell you I've
 
05:22:19.390 --> 05:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
sat I've sat in those meetings um where
 
05:22:21.788 --> 05:22:21.798 align:start position:0%
the due process is taking place and it's
 
05:22:23.430 --> 05:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
always read to the parent that they do
 
05:22:26.150 --> 05:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
have due process um and then we all kind
 
05:22:28.390 --> 05:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
of sign consent agreements so if that's
 
05:22:30.510 --> 05:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
what we're referring to that's my
 
05:22:32.750 --> 05:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge of due
 
05:22:36.990 --> 05:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
process thank you very much um I see
 
05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
noan oh repres
 
05:22:43.628 --> 05:22:43.638 align:start position:0%
Tanner I please go ahead thank you um i'
 
05:22:47.628 --> 05:22:47.638 align:start position:0%
just like to to mention that I I really
 
05:22:50.990 --> 05:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
didn't uh imp mean to imply that the
 
05:22:52.750 --> 05:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
only thing that religious schools teach
 
05:22:55.190 --> 05:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
are religion um I grew up in
 
05:22:57.070 --> 05:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania where Quaker schools were
 
05:22:58.430 --> 05:22:58.440 align:start position:0%
very prominent down around the
 
05:23:01.430 --> 05:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia area and they had a very
 
05:23:05.470 --> 05:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
high rating for academic standards um
 
05:23:09.190 --> 05:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
and uh you know I think that that uh non
 
05:23:12.590 --> 05:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
sectarian schools uh and sectarian
 
05:23:15.788 --> 05:23:15.798 align:start position:0%
schools um probably are you know they're
 
05:23:19.310 --> 05:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
they're fine um products of people from
 
05:23:23.070 --> 05:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
both um I have no problem with that um
 
05:23:26.150 --> 05:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make that clear I
 
05:23:29.670 --> 05:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
also uh wanted to just say that uh you
 
05:23:32.708 --> 05:23:32.718 align:start position:0%
know I think that uh they offer a good
 
05:23:34.750 --> 05:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
education for those families that wish
 
05:23:38.350 --> 05:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
to bring their child up in that uh that
 
05:23:41.470 --> 05:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
religion and that academic uh atmosphere
 
05:23:44.430 --> 05:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
so um I wanted to make my position clear
 
05:23:47.830 --> 05:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh if there are no
 
05:23:50.830 --> 05:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
further questions for Mr Chay I thank
 
05:23:53.110 --> 05:23:53.120 align:start position:0%

05:23:55.948 --> 05:23:55.958 align:start position:0%

05:24:07.070 --> 05:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
cordelli for recognizing me Barett
 
05:24:08.670 --> 05:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
Christina um executive director New
 
05:24:11.070 --> 05:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association um
 
05:24:13.430 --> 05:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
one quick um ask of the committee um
 
05:24:15.230 --> 05:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
when I did sign up to register I did
 
05:24:17.470 --> 05:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
sign up an opposition to the bill um
 
05:24:18.868 --> 05:24:18.878 align:start position:0%
I've had a chance to reread it and
 
05:24:20.590 --> 05:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
contemplate a little bit about it if if
 
05:24:23.110 --> 05:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
nhba could testimony could just be
 
05:24:24.788 --> 05:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
identified as neutral or not taken a
 
05:24:26.670 --> 05:24:26.680 align:start position:0%
specific position we'd certainly
 
05:24:30.030 --> 05:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um I I will agree that I
 
05:24:34.390 --> 05:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
think the espo a decision um does um uh
 
05:24:36.788 --> 05:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
make for the necessity to remove the the
 
05:24:39.628 --> 05:24:39.638 align:start position:0%
non- sectarian um language that's
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
currently in the law um so in consistent
 
05:24:44.390 --> 05:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
with that with that Supreme Court
 
05:24:47.470 --> 05:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
opinion um nhba still does have concerns
 
05:24:50.030 --> 05:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
over um the general policy aspects of
 
05:24:51.990 --> 05:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
the cin bill which was Senate Bill 8
 
05:24:55.708 --> 05:24:55.718 align:start position:0%
back in I believe 2017 if that was um
 
05:24:57.990 --> 05:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
and the only other concern that nhba has
 
05:24:59.548 --> 05:24:59.558 align:start position:0%
and it's not so much the sectarian
 
05:25:01.750 --> 05:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
aspect or non sectarian aspect with
 
05:25:03.270 --> 05:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
respect to the bill but rather sort of
 
05:25:07.030 --> 05:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
the broader policy aspects of um of of
 
05:25:08.830 --> 05:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
of the of of the cyen Bill of Senate
 
05:25:12.830 --> 05:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 8 um if a school board that if a
 
05:25:14.948 --> 05:25:14.958 align:start position:0%
school district that does not have
 
05:25:18.070 --> 05:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
schools um doesn't operate any schools
 
05:25:22.430 --> 05:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
chooses to send its children to a a
 
05:25:25.110 --> 05:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
religious school under that the cyen
 
05:25:29.590 --> 05:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
bill program I have concerns that and
 
05:25:31.788 --> 05:25:31.798 align:start position:0%
and that
 
05:25:34.030 --> 05:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
children may be forced for lack of a
 
05:25:35.910 --> 05:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
better phrase to attend a religious
 
05:25:37.628 --> 05:25:37.638 align:start position:0%
school that may be contrary to their
 
05:25:41.070 --> 05:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs um so for example my
 
05:25:43.190 --> 05:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is that Goan New Hampshire
 
05:25:45.628 --> 05:25:45.638 align:start position:0%
does not operate any schools I think
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
they have 60 kids maybe 80 kids I forget
 
05:25:51.190 --> 05:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
exactly how many um and for a number of
 
05:25:54.030 --> 05:25:54.040 align:start position:0%
years they sent their kids to um uh to
 
05:25:56.190 --> 05:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
Newport um and I now I think they have
 
05:25:57.708 --> 05:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
some sort of public school choice
 
05:26:01.230 --> 05:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
program um within within go
 
05:26:03.430 --> 05:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
and also my understanding that um the
 
05:26:05.150 --> 05:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
individual from out Royal Academy has
 
05:26:07.310 --> 05:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
approached the Goan school board and
 
05:26:10.470 --> 05:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
asked about um uh having the the Goan
 
05:26:12.030 --> 05:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
School Board um send some of the
 
05:26:15.628 --> 05:26:15.638 align:start position:0%
children to uh to Mount Royal Academy
 
05:26:17.590 --> 05:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me if that were to say an
 
05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
exclusive contract um under the the
 
05:26:23.070 --> 05:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
school board approval program um where
 
05:26:25.390 --> 05:26:25.400 align:start position:0%
all students had to attend Mount Royal
 
05:26:26.628 --> 05:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
Academy and I'm assuming it's a k
 
05:26:28.270 --> 05:26:28.280 align:start position:0%
through2 school I don't know anything
 
05:26:30.590 --> 05:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
about the school um I think that would
 
05:26:33.190 --> 05:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
would be problematic um you know
 
05:26:34.510 --> 05:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
certainly the school board has a right
 
05:26:36.350 --> 05:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
to do that under this bill and removing
 
05:26:38.030 --> 05:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
the nonsectarian language they would
 
05:26:39.548 --> 05:26:39.558 align:start position:0%
have the right to do that but I'm
 
05:26:41.310 --> 05:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
worried about the impact on the kids who
 
05:26:43.990 --> 05:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
may not um share sort of the doctrinal
 
05:26:46.750 --> 05:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
beliefs that the religious school um
 
05:26:50.430 --> 05:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
might have um or might require so I I
 
05:26:52.030 --> 05:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
think that could be a matter of contract
 
05:26:53.708 --> 05:26:53.718 align:start position:0%
obviously to some degree between the
 
05:26:55.390 --> 05:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
public school and the and the private
 
05:26:57.070 --> 05:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
school but I'm just thinking of a
 
05:26:58.708 --> 05:26:58.718 align:start position:0%
situation where a district that does not
 
05:27:00.750 --> 05:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
operate any schools if they were to
 
05:27:04.910 --> 05:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
engage in a a contract K through 12 um
 
05:27:06.788 --> 05:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
and it was a singular contract an
 
05:27:08.548 --> 05:27:08.558 align:start position:0%
exclusive contract between the religious
 
05:27:10.590 --> 05:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
school and the and the public school and
 
05:27:12.470 --> 05:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
the the the school board to send their
 
05:27:14.910 --> 05:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
kids there I'd be worried about the kids
 
05:27:17.868 --> 05:27:17.878 align:start position:0%
who may not share that particular Faith
 
05:27:20.110 --> 05:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
or that particular religion so those are
 
05:27:22.628 --> 05:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
my only comments about that um again if
 
05:27:24.830 --> 05:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
if nhba testimony could be identified as
 
05:27:26.110 --> 05:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
being neutral on this bill we'd
 
05:27:28.788 --> 05:27:28.798 align:start position:0%
appreciate that change um but with that
 
05:27:30.190 --> 05:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to answer any questions of
 
05:27:32.788 --> 05:27:32.798 align:start position:0%
the committee has thank you we uh we did
 
05:27:37.788 --> 05:27:37.798 align:start position:0%

cordelli okay next we have Jody
 
05:27:55.948 --> 05:27:55.958 align:start position:0%
Underwood she is an elected official
 
05:27:58.150 --> 05:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
testifying on behalf of herself she
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
supports the
 
05:28:03.510 --> 05:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
bill welcome to education
 
05:28:06.430 --> 05:28:06.440 align:start position:0%

Zoom when you start announcing it's very

strange Sor it's okay um good afternoon
 
05:28:18.548 --> 05:28:18.558 align:start position:0%
everybody my name for the record is Jody
 
05:28:20.548 --> 05:28:20.558 align:start position:0%
Underwood I am still the vice chair of
 
05:28:21.910 --> 05:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
the cyen school
 
05:28:25.150 --> 05:28:25.160 align:start position:0%
board cin will be directly affected by
 
05:28:28.110 --> 05:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
this bill should it become lack so the
 
05:28:30.628 --> 05:28:30.638 align:start position:0%
addition of the term non sectarian was
 
05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
made as a compromise during the passage
 
05:28:34.310 --> 05:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
of the cin Bill to avoid Court
 
05:28:36.070 --> 05:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
challenges over whether towns could
 
05:28:37.868 --> 05:28:37.878 align:start position:0%
tuition students to religious private
 
05:28:40.390 --> 05:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
schools now it needs to be changed to
 
05:28:43.230 --> 05:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
avoid Court challenges again maybe
 
05:28:44.628 --> 05:28:44.638 align:start position:0%
you're aware that there's already a
 
05:28:47.910 --> 05:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
court case pending um and that's because
 
05:28:50.070 --> 05:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's in support of the federal decision
 
05:28:51.868 --> 05:28:51.878 align:start position:0%
that said it would be discrimination to
 
05:28:53.430 --> 05:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
exclude religious schools when other
 
05:28:54.868 --> 05:28:54.878 align:start position:0%
private schools are offered in a school
 
05:28:54.878 --> 05:28:56.590 align:start position:0%
private schools are offered in a school
choice

05:28:56.590 --> 05:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
choice
 
05:28:59.910 --> 05:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
program as for I was curious about this
 
05:29:01.910 --> 05:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
it rep representative Mullen asked about
 
05:29:05.230 --> 05:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
local bias um districts aren't actually
 
05:29:07.868 --> 05:29:07.878 align:start position:0%
placing students in religious schools
 
05:29:10.270 --> 05:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
parents for from for Town tuition this
 
05:29:12.230 --> 05:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
is how tuition works at least in a place
 
05:29:14.910 --> 05:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
like cin parents will choose the school
 
05:29:17.070 --> 05:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
according to their preferences so I'm
 
05:29:20.270 --> 05:29:20.280 align:start position:0%
not sure what you meant where the bias
 
05:29:23.990 --> 05:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
would would come in um although I do um
 
05:29:27.350 --> 05:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
recognize um baric Christina's comment
 
05:29:29.590 --> 05:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
um as being valid that if we only had a
 
05:29:31.868 --> 05:29:31.878 align:start position:0%
religious school then it would be uh
 
05:29:34.590 --> 05:29:34.600 align:start position:0%
essentially a placement and that is
 
05:29:37.230 --> 05:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
where um where it differs I I think that
 
05:29:38.548 --> 05:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
that probably should be stated more
 
05:29:40.548 --> 05:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
clearly that it shouldn't be allowed to
 
05:29:43.510 --> 05:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
be the only choice
 
05:29:48.430 --> 05:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
um so to continue um if cacr 3 is
 
05:29:49.868 --> 05:29:49.878 align:start position:0%
successful in removing the Blain
 
05:29:52.350 --> 05:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment from the state constitution
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
then that will um close the challenge
 
05:29:57.708 --> 05:29:57.718 align:start position:0%
for the a constitutional challenge right
 
05:30:00.590 --> 05:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
that will make that disappear however as
 
05:30:02.910 --> 05:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
long as sectarian schools are excluded
 
05:30:05.070 --> 05:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
by Statute an opening will remain to
 
05:30:07.430 --> 05:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
challenge any school district that tries
 
05:30:10.390 --> 05:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
to save its taxpayers money to provide
 
05:30:11.990 --> 05:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
some of its students with better
 
05:30:14.190 --> 05:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
education according to their parents'
 
05:30:17.070 --> 05:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
choice and also respect the experience
 
05:30:19.070 --> 05:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
and expertise of parents regarding their
 
05:30:19.080 --> 05:30:20.470 align:start position:0%
and expertise of parents regarding their
own

05:30:20.470 --> 05:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
own
 
05:30:23.110 --> 05:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
children of course having said all that
 
05:30:25.708 --> 05:30:25.718 align:start position:0%
the bill would be improved and we can
 
05:30:27.948 --> 05:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
argue about this if instead of removing
 
05:30:31.110 --> 05:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
nonsectarian to change it to sectarian
 
05:30:33.030 --> 05:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
or non- sectarian which would make the
 
05:30:35.110 --> 05:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill clear enough to be
 
05:30:39.310 --> 05:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
understood by anybody um including um to
 
05:30:44.030 --> 05:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
be a little um including um judges in
 
05:30:46.750 --> 05:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
the courts who as I've said twice today
 
05:30:49.788 --> 05:30:49.798 align:start position:0%
already seem to take words out to to
 
05:30:52.270 --> 05:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
lead to their own um how they want the
 
05:30:57.030 --> 05:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
outcome to to be and that ends my
 
05:31:00.548 --> 05:31:00.558 align:start position:0%
testimony very much any questions for
 
05:31:03.190 --> 05:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
Miss Underwood represent
 
05:31:05.788 --> 05:31:05.798 align:start position:0%
Mullen not a question just a point of
 
05:31:08.868 --> 05:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
clarification to uh Miss Underwood that
 
05:31:11.548 --> 05:31:11.558 align:start position:0%
representative lad's Amendment uh
 
05:31:14.628 --> 05:31:14.638 align:start position:0%
indicates that the school district will
 
05:31:19.230 --> 05:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
assign or the parent will choose I was
 
05:31:22.350 --> 05:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
looking for Clarity on the difference in
 
05:31:22.360 --> 05:31:25.270 align:start position:0%
looking for Clarity on the difference in
the

05:31:25.270 --> 05:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:29.150 --> 05:31:29.160 align:start position:0%

the New Hampshire Department of
 
05:32:00.548 --> 05:32:00.558 align:start position:0%
Education about the town tuition program

and so to representative um Tanner's
 
05:32:05.310 --> 05:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
concern about future litigation this
 
05:32:07.350 --> 05:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
program is already the subject of
 
05:32:09.670 --> 05:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
litigation um and that litigation would
 
05:32:12.350 --> 05:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
actually be resolved by this um House
 
05:32:14.750 --> 05:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 282 which this this bill would
 
05:32:16.548 --> 05:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
solve the problems that we rais in our
 
05:32:19.030 --> 05:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuit um as a quick background our
 
05:32:20.948 --> 05:32:20.958 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is challenging the exclusion of
 
05:32:22.948 --> 05:32:22.958 align:start position:0%
religious schools from the town tuition
 
05:32:26.030 --> 05:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
program um our clients the Griffins live
 
05:32:28.110 --> 05:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
in Cen New Hampshire which you just
 
05:32:30.510 --> 05:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
heard from Miss Underwood is a two iing
 
05:32:34.390 --> 05:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
town they send their grandson Clayton to
 
05:32:37.110 --> 05:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
Mount Royal Academy and the Cen School
 
05:32:39.110 --> 05:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
District would like to pay for his
 
05:32:41.350 --> 05:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
tuition at Mount Royal Academy but can't
 
05:32:44.830 --> 05:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
under the current statute and House Bill
 
05:32:47.510 --> 05:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
282 would eliminate the exclusion that
 
05:32:49.990 --> 05:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
restricts cin in this way resolving the
 
05:32:52.510 --> 05:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
problems we rais in our lawsuit and AC
 
05:32:55.670 --> 05:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
accomplishing two important purposes um
 
05:32:57.830 --> 05:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
first as I believe you all heard this
 
05:33:00.150 --> 05:33:00.160 align:start position:0%
morning with regard to the blank
 
05:33:02.150 --> 05:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment a recent ruling by the United
 
05:33:03.830 --> 05:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
States Supreme Court held that the
 
05:33:05.750 --> 05:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
exclusion of religious schools from
 
05:33:07.830 --> 05:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
Choice program solely because they are
 
05:33:10.470 --> 05:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
religious violates the First Amendment
 
05:33:12.670 --> 05:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
so the current exclusion violates this
 
05:33:14.708 --> 05:33:14.718 align:start position:0%
constitutional protection and I believe
 
05:33:17.670 --> 05:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
if this if this um House Bill 282 does
 
05:33:19.948 --> 05:33:19.958 align:start position:0%
not pass will ultimately be struck down
 
05:33:22.070 --> 05:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
by the court anyway just at greater
 
05:33:25.030 --> 05:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
expense second house bill 282 removes
 
05:33:27.110 --> 05:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
some of the ambiguity from the statute
 
05:33:29.070 --> 05:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
and makes clear to school districts what
 
05:33:30.990 --> 05:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
their options are under the law if they
 
05:33:32.548 --> 05:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
are a tuition in
 
05:33:35.030 --> 05:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
town although the school districts who
 
05:33:37.310 --> 05:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
lack a a school for certain grade levels
 
05:33:39.590 --> 05:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
May already choose to allow parents to
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
select the school that their child
 
05:33:44.590 --> 05:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
attends as cin does um this
 
05:33:46.750 --> 05:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
clarification in the language makes that
 
05:33:48.510 --> 05:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
option more clear and ensures that all
 
05:33:50.310 --> 05:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
tuition and towns know that they can
 
05:33:52.548 --> 05:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
offer this choice to
 
05:33:54.910 --> 05:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
families um for these reasons we would
 
05:33:57.070 --> 05:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
support the passage of House Bill 282
 
05:33:58.868 --> 05:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take any
 
05:33:58.878 --> 05:34:00.910 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to take any
questions

05:34:00.910 --> 05:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:34:04.708 --> 05:34:04.718 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for attorney
 
05:34:08.070 --> 05:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
West I'm not seeing see none thank you
 
05:34:10.070 --> 05:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
very much for your time today thank you
 
05:34:11.948 --> 05:34:11.958 align:start position:0%
very much thank
 
05:34:15.230 --> 05:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
you uh we did have car Carl lad
 
05:34:17.190 --> 05:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
scheduled to speak but I believe he has
 
05:34:18.510 --> 05:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
dropped he dropped
 
05:34:21.990 --> 05:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
off so that's all I have I think that's
 
05:34:25.590 --> 05:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh all the people who want to testify uh
 
05:34:29.548 --> 05:34:29.558 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 282 so I will uh close the
 
05:34:29.558 --> 05:34:31.230 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 282 so I will uh close the
hearing

05:34:31.230 --> 05:34:31.240 align:start position:0%

lead thank you very much uh so with that
 
05:35:09.628 --> 05:35:09.638 align:start position:0%
we this hearing is closed and uh we've
 
05:35:13.430 --> 05:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:16.190 --> 05:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
today and uh at this point in time it's
 
05:35:18.150 --> 05:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
going on quarter three I don't think I'm
 
05:35:20.470 --> 05:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
going to go on and do any excting this
 
05:35:24.030 --> 05:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon um I will move into that and
 
05:35:27.310 --> 05:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
start working on those bills uh next
 
05:35:32.590 --> 05:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
week uh we have the uh six bills I
 
05:35:36.190 --> 05:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
believe or so to deal with in hearing
 
05:35:39.670 --> 05:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
still and then um then we're getting
 
05:35:43.030 --> 05:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
into the ex we have at least 30 of those
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
bills that's an approximation so we have
 
05:35:49.190 --> 05:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
a work out of course um but I think that
 
05:35:51.510 --> 05:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to get done uh we
 
05:35:54.270 --> 05:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
