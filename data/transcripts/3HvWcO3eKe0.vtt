morning

00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.760 --> 00:15:12.829 align:start position:0%
 
pleas

00:15:12.829 --> 00:15:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
morning everybody the time being 10:15

session so first I will open the
 
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
executive session on HB 1254 and
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman um I move itl on
hb1

00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:43.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
Jordan would you like to speak to your
 
00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
motion yes uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
um I think we all recognize that a very
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
strong case was made um by a variety of
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
proponents at the
 
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
hearing or some kind of an accommodation
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
that allows them to raise funds that can
 
00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
be directed
 
00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
towards um local Services particularly
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
Public Safety police fire
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
Etc um I'm recalling
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
particularly the case being made
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
regarding Conway and Portsmith two very
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
different municipalities and
 
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
situations so
 
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
so the concern is
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
real something probably should be done
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
the question though is whether this bill
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
does it in a way that uh on balance
 
00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:42.590 align:start position:0%
does it in a way that uh on balance
makes

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
makes
 
00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
sense this is an isolated fee it creates
 
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
a new fee in the law there's no
 
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.309 align:start position:0%
a new fee in the law there's no
precedent

00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
precedent
 
00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
for it um delegates to the localities to
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
decide whether to have a fee not have a
 
00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
fee have it at $2 or have it up to
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
$2 uh there is as representative ol had
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
suggested a checkerboard effect that may
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
occur um I also thought it was very
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
interesting particularly in the
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
discussion that
 
00:17:12.919 --> 00:17:14.750 align:start position:0%
discussion that
followed

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
followed
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
that while the
 
00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
pressure of visitors to the Mount
 
00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
Washington Valley and the Conway area is
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
largely linked to
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
lodging there are a host of other kinds
 
00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:33.160 align:start position:0%
of pressures that arise retail
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
centers Portsmith is probably more of a
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant pressure than a lodging
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
pressure towns that are along the
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
Vermont main or Massachusetts border
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
tend to attract a lot of uh activity
 
00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
coming uh into the state in my town on a
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
given day half the plates are Vermont
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
license plates Lebanon was uh described
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
by representative Aly and that's not
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily a vacation or lodging
 
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.029 align:start position:0%
necessarily a vacation or lodging
situation

00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
so I think we realize that while the
 
00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.590 align:start position:0%
so I think we realize that while the
Conway

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
Conway
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
situation is begging for a solution the
 
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
issue represents itself in different
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
ways in different communities and a more
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
comprehensive solution is what we need
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
and so I did
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
suggest and I'd be happy to be part of
 
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
uh trying to do something with with this
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
that we may want to look at the meals
 
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax we've had suggestions of
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
reducing the rate maybe and and I'm not
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
pushing this yet it's just a suggestion
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
maybe we look at the idea of reducing
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
the rate but then having a a local uh
 
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
sear charge so I just think that it's
 
00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
it's a serious
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
issue um we shouldn't uh vote itl with
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
the intention of burying it but we
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
should we should not move this bill
 
00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
forward and we should revisit
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
you any other discussion representative
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
Aly thank
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
you um we've been working on this bill
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
for quite a while it gets obscured by
 
00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
the uh pressure from Portsmith and the
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
pressure now from on the uh Lakes
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
Region and
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
parts of of the North Country uh for uh
 
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
help with the huge increase they get
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
during the day uh during during certain
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
weeks and and
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
Seasons uh for uh from tourists
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
on and then there's a lot of others of
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
us that get the pressure
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
because we
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
uh our retail centers and job centers
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
for our regions and the people who live
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
outside of the urban Hub I call them for
 
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.029 align:start position:0%
outside of the urban Hub I call them for
uh

00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
and are benefiting in their property
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
taxes because most of the services that
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
they use are in the urban Hub and the
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
urban Hub frequently most the time I
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
think H also has nonprofit services that
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
are also used uh for the entire region
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
and so the The Hub loses property tax
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
from having the nonprofits there and it
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
loses uh tax um on it it increases its
 
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
services particularly in public safety
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
meas measures I think that this is the
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
one change we've made since uh previous
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
years that's significant is that um I
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
was struggling with the people who do do
 
00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
with do tourism to get them to
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
understand there are a lot of other
 
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
places that have this problem and the
 
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
committee has recognized that problem
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
um uh the idea of bringing it forward
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
for the Public Services the public
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
safety uh issues not just of of fire of
 
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
um enforcement of of
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh planning regulations of uh the
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
number of people who come in and behave
 
00:21:58.830 --> 00:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
badly uh on
 
00:22:02.669 --> 00:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
either stealing or or running into each
 
00:22:02.679 --> 00:22:03.830 align:start position:0%
either stealing or or running into each
other's

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
other's
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
cars um and creating huge traffic
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
jams uh and
 
00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
um but also um the health emergencies
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
that come up when those people are there
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
during the day and for the tourism areas
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
during the night um that uh run into
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
medical problems and have to uh have
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
help from our
 
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.190 align:start position:0%
help from our
EMTs

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
EMTs
 
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.470 align:start position:0%
EMTs
um

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
so this is something that seemed to us a
 
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
simple and it's not a by any means a
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
complete solution but uh the towns that
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
we have consulted towns and cities that
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
we have consulted about this uh really
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
believe that this will help us to try to
 
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
keep our property taxes down Lebanon has
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
the highest property taxes north of
 
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:14.440 align:start position:0%
Claremont uh in in our region in our uh
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
in the Northwest
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
country and I think they rival a lot of
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
the ones in SE
 
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.110 align:start position:0%
the ones in SE
Coast

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
Coast
 
00:23:28.909 --> 00:23:28.919 align:start position:0%
um and it means that that the urban core
 
00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
is also
 
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
losing uh its lower lower income and
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
middle income people we've lost a huge
 
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
number of our middle inome people we
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
have a lot of subsidized housing that's
 
00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
one of our
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
services and we're continuing to do it
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
but um the middle income people have
 
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
found that in order to be able to
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
survive they have to move out to the
 
00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.630 align:start position:0%
survive they have to move out to the
bedroom

00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
bedroom
 
00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.269 align:start position:0%
bedroom
communities

00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
and on we didn't want to impose
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
something that would
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
hit our neighbors our neighboring
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
communities which is what we'd do if we
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
started trying to put some kind of a fee
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
or increase a tax on rooms and
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
meals um which is mostly
 
00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:30.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
um I think that this is a
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
reasonable partial solution to the
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
problem and I'm going to be going up on
 
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:44.750 align:start position:0%
problem and I'm going to be going up on
the

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
floor probably with the
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh to defend it uh next week if
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
it's in the calendar next week
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
um so that's thank
 
00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.430 align:start position:0%
um so that's thank
you

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
um represent
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh thank you Mr chair I a bill
 
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
very much like this presented itself to
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
ways and means when when I was a a
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
member of this committee uh the term
 
00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:23.799 align:start position:0%
before last and uh I agree with uh
 
00:25:27.149 --> 00:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
everything the the the the my colleague
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
from lean has said and I agree with the
 
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
the initial representative that this is
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
a real issue it's been a real issue for
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
several years I I I think I think to the
 
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
question of what's the best way to
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
address it uh it it it seems to me that
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
we used to have a
 
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
philosophy that uh we should keep our
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
tax structure simple and uh and so uh
 
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
since government does one of two things
 
00:25:59.789 --> 00:25:59.799 align:start position:0%
basically we tax and we spend what what
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
I think I would rather see as a
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
strategic approach is is rather than
 
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
messing with the tax code to complicate
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
it and delegate it uh I think I'd rather
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that there's a problem on
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
the on this and handle it on the
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
spending side I it would be great I
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
think if there were some sort of a
 
00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
public safety Grant like located
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
somewhere like in the tourism area or or
 
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere where a very simple Grant
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
application could be submitted to seek
 
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for the incremental costs
 
00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
accumulated for The Unique needs of that
 
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
Community because uh that way um the
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
complexity of the range of towns and
 
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
their needs could be incorporated better
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
and done in a more flexible way where
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
the state on the spending side every two
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
years we take a look at spending and
 
00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
that's very flexible once something gets
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
into the tax code I think most of us
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
know it it's inflexible and is probably
 
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
not going to adapt uh as Society adapts
 
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
so so I I I I I I agree with the the
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
motion um and uh and I hope that we
 
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
don't drop the ball for another two
 
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
terms on this
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
issue thank you representative
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
shamberg oh Southworth thank you um for
 
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
the chair we haven't had this situation
 
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think yet in this committee but
 
00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:32.679 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify if we split
 
00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:36.039 align:start position:0%
evenly which would be 1010 it would go
 
00:27:38.669 --> 00:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
OTP but there'd be thorough descriptions
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
side that is correct if it split 1010
 
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
it'll go to the floor as OTP pardon me I
 
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
think and then also I think it would go
 
00:27:50.789 --> 00:27:50.799 align:start position:0%
uh without
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation motion would be OTP yes
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
that's correct um and the other point
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'd make and I'm not sure I heard it
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
already is this is enabling
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
legislation um which really does give
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
choice to a lot of communities about
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
what they want to
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
do thank you uh representative
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
uh shamberg shamberg yeah thank you Mr
 
00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:15.909 align:start position:0%
uh shamberg shamberg yeah thank you Mr
chairman

00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
uh I'm a member of the wiet select board
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
I'm also the chairman of the select
 
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.190 align:start position:0%
I'm also the chairman of the select
board

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:24.200 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
and who better knows what their
 
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.350 align:start position:0%
and who better knows what their
community

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
needs than the local
 
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
government that is operating a a a
 
00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.070 align:start position:0%
government that is operating a a a
town

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have the uh draw that a
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
Conway does or a Lebanon or Peterboro or
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
along the coast
 
00:28:51.149 --> 00:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth but they come here and
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
they've presented this as a way to
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
resolve what they know is a problem and
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
it looks like we're wanting central
 
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
government to dictate or say we know
 
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.870 align:start position:0%
government to dictate or say we know
better

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
and as a local elected official in
 
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
wilmet and
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
Sutton I find that this is a very
 
00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:18.519 align:start position:0%
reasonable bill to help solve the
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
problem and going to representative
 
00:29:24.909 --> 00:29:24.919 align:start position:0%
edwards's uh uh statements uh you speak
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
very well on it but it sounds like we
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
make the decision here when we have a
 
00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that would solve
 
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
taking central government out of it and
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
letting our locals decide enabling
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
legislation as representative
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
Southworth thank you for
 
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative elme did
 
00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
you have oh okay representative
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
00:29:57.509 --> 00:29:57.519 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman uh I want
 
00:30:00.509 --> 00:30:00.519 align:start position:0%
to re reiterate uh representative
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
southworth's comment that this is not an
 
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
imposition of a tax this is enabling
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
legislation to allow local control so
 
00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
that communities that know what they
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
need can deal with it the best way they
 
00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:19.480 align:start position:0%
can uh I have no idea how the potential
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
of lowering the rooms and meals tax
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
would help in this regard at all as
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
uh we have
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
already been adding to our budget in in
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
light of uh representative Edwards
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
comments about grants to Regions we have
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
already increased our budget this year
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
due to the funding for the efas and
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
presumably we're going to be getting a
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
request from the governor to spend
 
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
almost a million dollars to send some of
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
our national guards people to Texas to
 
00:30:59.190 --> 00:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
the border
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
and this is a way for the state to not
 
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
have to deal with any additional
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
funding but leave it to the localities
 
00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
to make up their own minds about what
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
they need it makes to me no sense to say
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
to localities no we know better than you
 
00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
so I am uh opposed to representative
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
spilsbury's motion and will be hopefully
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
voting to pass it now pass this
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
bill representative Bolton thank you Mr
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
chair um i' I'd like to affirm and um I
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
guess um agree with representative
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
shamberg um I am also uh on the Plymouth
 
00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
select board I'm I'm the vice chair
 
00:31:48.629 --> 00:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
currently and uh Plymouth is a community
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
that has over 53% of its properties uh
 
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:55.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofit are owned by nonprofits and we
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
have to deal with um basically
 
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
maintaining the safety and and health of
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
those um areas uh with our limited
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
budget uh within the Plymouth residence
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
and so you know greater than half of our
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
town is maintained by um people that are
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
are under exorbitant taxes and the
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
university that is in the town also
 
00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
provides um some help but it also
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
provides some challenges you know we
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
have uh pirate parties and and um
 
00:32:30.909 --> 00:32:30.919 align:start position:0%
different um celebrations that the
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
University students undergo and that
 
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
increases the load on our our police
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
force we've had to uh
 
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
engage um other you know police as well
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
and pay for their ability to maintain
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
the peace um and so when we're offered
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
or perhaps uh able to like take
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
advantage of something that we might be
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
able to charge um you know $2 or a fee
 
00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
for a state and in hotels in our
 
00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
community um it seems like a unique
 
00:33:02.909 --> 00:33:02.919 align:start position:0%
opportunity and something that we
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
actually need um very desperately
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise we just rely on increasing
 
00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
property taxes so um I would also oppose
 
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:11.990 align:start position:0%
property taxes so um I would also oppose
the

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
itl okay uh representative
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
duet thank you Mr
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and I think my colleagues have
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
made the point that I'm going to make
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
right now local control is most
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
important but in that I I don't
 
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
presently serve or have served in my
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
local government but I know that my
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
local government at least in Salem takes
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
a very hard look before they make
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
approvals for hotels ins lodging
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
establishments okay there's City
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
Planning town planning impact fees etc
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
etc etc so there was an argument made
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
for these establishments to go into
 
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:55.950 align:start position:0%
for these establishments to go into
these

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.669 align:start position:0%
these
communities

00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
why is it
 
00:34:04.629 --> 00:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
now an issue for us to address where the
 
00:34:09.069 --> 00:34:09.079 align:start position:0%
lack of appropriate planning becomes an
 
00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:12.919 align:start position:0%
issue okay I I think we we can't go to
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
the we for each each problem we have a
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
huge water problem in the state right
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
now do we assess or allow for
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
assessments for certain Fe I mean this
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
incrementally should be done at the
 
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
local level it should be handled at the
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
local level and if there's another means
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
I I just don't agree with this
 
00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle at all thank you representative
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
roachford thank you Mr chairman and I
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
think that I've made my position clear
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh in that I come from a and I rep I'm
 
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:49.079 align:start position:0%
here to represent a district and that's
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
I'm here to to speak for my constituents
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
and and I come from a town a population
 
00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
about 5,800 and any given day it swells
 
00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.510 align:start position:0%
about 5,800 and any given day it swells
to

00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
25,000 um Littleton New Hampshire 5,800
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
people has a full-time 24hour 7day a
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
week fire department we recently added a
 
00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
full-time 24hour 7-Day a week Ambulance
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
Service um we're going to be talking
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
about uh the need come soon to add an
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
additional $300,000 ambulance to our uh
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
our our Emergency
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.470 align:start position:0%
our our Emergency
Services

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
the the difference is we don't have a
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
lot of hotel rooms in the in the town of
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
Litteton we don't have a lot of lodging
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
facilities we don't have a lot of Border
 
00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:38.839 align:start position:0%
houses what we have is shopping centers
 
00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
we have big boxes we have restaurants we
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
have a we have breweries we have things
 
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:47.560 align:start position:0%
that want people want to come and see
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
and and and do and take part in but as a
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
result it puts strain on our Emergency
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
Services like everyone has said
 
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
here I'm I'm going to I'm going to
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
support the itl motion and again to to
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
reiterate my
 
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
colleague not because it is something
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
that I oppose the idea of but I don't
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
think this bill goes far enough I don't
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
think a fee on the lodging would
 
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
actually adequately address the needs of
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
my community um you know I look at a fee
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
on housing in rooms and in motels and we
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have a ton of those but we have
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of restaurants and we pay a
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
significant amount of rooms and meals
 
00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
tax per capita for our area and there
 
00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:33.079 align:start position:0%
are areas that don't have any
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
restaurants or or facilities at all um
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
that are benefiting from that so I I
 
00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:40.839 align:start position:0%
agree with the concept wholeheartedly
 
00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
agree with the concept I'm 100% on board
 
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
with it uh but I think that this
 
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
mechanism is not the the right approach
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
for my constituents and uh if if if we
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
can itl this this year bring it back
 
00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
next year and and do something that
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
would be a little more comprehensive I
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
and address the needs more adequately of
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
my community I'd be happy to support
 
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
that before I call the next person um I
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
represent Salem Salem would fit into
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
roughly what you just said our
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
population in Salem swells from
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
something like 30,000 to 100,000 on any
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
particular day and we don't have many
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
hotels to collect that from so a more
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
comprehensive solution would would make
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
sense uh representative elberger thank
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh representative ducet
 
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
said something about leaving this to the
 
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
localities that's exactly what this bill
 
00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
is trying to do say to the localities
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
make your decision about it the argument
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
that because we don't have a perfect
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing solution to an issue to
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
me doesn't mean let's wait until we do
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
because it may take us 20 years to get a
 
00:37:58.270 --> 00:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
perfect solution if we can start by
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
taking a step in this regard we may be
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
able to also say at some point hopefully
 
00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
not too long in the future the
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
communities that don't have restaurants
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
can also look at adding a fee for some
 
00:38:12.359 --> 00:38:13.510 align:start position:0%
can also look at adding a fee for some
other

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
services we don't need to have a first
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
bill be the complete solution it can be
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
the first step to a complete
 
00:38:29.069 --> 00:38:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
spillsbury yes thank you Mr chairman you
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
know I I think the comments around the
 
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
table have been
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
constructive and the observations about
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
what factually is going on in a variety
 
00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
of communities are not anything I would
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
argue with I think representative rord
 
00:38:49.069 --> 00:38:49.079 align:start position:0%
put it very
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
well I think the problem here is number
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
one this is a fragment of larger problem
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
and number two without looking at the
 
00:39:02.109 --> 00:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
larger problem and the implications for
 
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
other communities that have pressures
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
caused by different
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
factors we don't know whether this is an
 
00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.670 align:start position:0%
factors we don't know whether this is an
appropriate

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
mechanism so we've got communities where
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
it's the overnight lodging crowd we've
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
got communities where it's the
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
restaurant crowd we got communities
 
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
where maybe it's a casino got
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
communities where it's retail we have
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
communities that are employment centers
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
and Border communities that may be a
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
blend of several of those so I just
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
think it would be unwise to move this
 
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
bill without thinking more
 
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
comprehensively about what would work
 
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
for that variety of
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
communities representative
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
leapley thank you Mr
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
chair I agree that the conversation has
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
been very productive I think part of
 
00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
what we're all talking about is that we
 
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
need a broad and diverse source of
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
Taxation and I think it's clear that if
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
we had a comprehensive bill it wouldn't
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
pass because it would be a list of new
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
taxes so I feel like we have to do
 
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
something in New Hampshire that where we
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
act like a community where we act like
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
as communities we have something in
 
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
common and if we're going to do taxation
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
at the state level which it sounds like
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
people here some people here are saying
 
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
it has to be done by the state we don't
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
want it done
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
locally we have to have a mechanism to
 
00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
share that with the localities in a way
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
that makes sense we have yet to find
 
00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
that solution and it seems like
 
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
ideologically many people are opposed to
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
taxation period and what we've done as a
 
00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
body is cut all of any kind of diverse
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
source of taxation so we keep putting it
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
back on the property taxpayers we've we
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
cut the indd tax so we keep taking out
 
00:41:08.349 --> 00:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
sources of Taxation nobody wants to pass
 
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
new taxes and so we're not replacing
 
00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
those and so again it just comes back to
 
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:16.520 align:start position:0%
property taxes so I feel like this is a
 
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
modest proposal
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
$2 that is targeted to hit folks who
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
aren't currently paying taxes in New
 
00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right this is people who are
 
00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
staying in hotels so people who are
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
costing the state something and who
 
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily paying in or maybe
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
not perfectly so we have a room in meals
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
tax that's you know collecting some at
 
00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.349 align:start position:0%
tax that's you know collecting some at
the

00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
restaurant this would collect a little
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
bit more in the hotels if we want to
 
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
talk about a sales tax then you're
 
00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
talking about retail right people are
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
saying well we have retail spaces and
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
this isn't capturing it
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
so I think a series of very modest very
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
targeted proposals make sense in this
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
case it's very modest and it's targeted
 
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
to the people who need to kick in a
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
little bit because they're enjoying our
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
our state maybe on the weekend or for a
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
week at a time I think it's fair to ask
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
them to kick in and it seems fair to me
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
to ask the localities who know best to
 
00:42:25.870 --> 00:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
decide if this is for them or not thank
 
00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:26.710 align:start position:0%
decide if this is for them or not thank
you

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.510 align:start position:0%
you
thank

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:42:32.109 --> 00:42:32.119 align:start position:0%
you do we have any other uh yes repres
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
Aly uh just um a couple of things um
 
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.030 align:start position:0%
Aly uh just um a couple of things um
this

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
isn't just about tourism we have a lot
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
of of towns that or cities Urban cores
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
that have this problem around the
 
00:42:56.549 --> 00:42:56.559 align:start position:0%
state and um it is not always was a
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
problem that our
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
ancestors uh created for us in Lebanon
 
00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:09.160 align:start position:0%
um our mayor did set up a contract with
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
the hospital when it moved over from
 
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
Hanover and brought a huge amount of
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
extra work with it um and sprawl
 
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
uh but um and we went through a fouryear
 
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.829 align:start position:0%
uh but um and we went through a fouryear
uh

00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:26.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
fight when we tried to uh on get them to
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
pay a pilt that meant something the the
 
00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:39.160 align:start position:0%
mayor had given it to them in perpetuity
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
for two $2
 
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
million uh and we ran out of the money
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
in 11 years so um but um and they also
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
made some other mistakes that we have
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
been paying for for 50 years now uh but
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
on Plymouth did not ask to have a State
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
University and the State University
 
00:44:08.319 --> 00:44:09.510 align:start position:0%
University and the State University
doesn't

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:15.079 align:start position:0%
pay and we didn't ask to have the
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
services that we still have that are
 
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
based in Lebanon that belong to the
 
00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.790 align:start position:0%
based in Lebanon that belong to the
state

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
government and um a lot of of places
 
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
that our Urban cores do have uh service
 
00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
I think Littleton has a fair number of
 
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
of these Services they've been taking
 
00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
them out of Lebanon because our rents
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
are so high um they're higher than
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
anybody else's now
 
00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.549 align:start position:0%
anybody else's now
um

00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
and and so this this isn't just about
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
tourism this is about the imbalance when
 
00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
you depend depending only on a almost
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
entirely in your tax system on a local
 
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.390 align:start position:0%
entirely in your tax system on a local
property

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
tax which only takes from the people
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
that live inside the boundaries of the
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
town and I hear a lot of interest in
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out other ways to do
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
this um one of the things that's been
 
00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
motivating us with this one is that it
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't take from our
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
neighbors because we think that we have
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
more neighbor Neighbors in the
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
legislature than we do
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
cores so that we wouldn't be able to get
 
00:45:38.559 --> 00:45:39.430 align:start position:0%
cores so that we wouldn't be able to get
those

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.990 align:start position:0%
those
through

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:52.829 --> 00:45:52.839 align:start position:0%
um problems
 
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
of of a um of trying to get everybody
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
into something it is not a tax it is a
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
fee it is a set amount which is $2 or
 
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
under for a hotel room which is little
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
enough that very few visitors would pay
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
any attention to it
 
00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.870 align:start position:0%
any attention to it
whatsoever

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah and I did want to just say about
 
00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.470 align:start position:0%
um yeah and I did want to just say about
the

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:30.549 --> 00:46:30.559 align:start position:0%
amendment that um what it does is to
 
00:46:33.549 --> 00:46:33.559 align:start position:0%
restrict the rooms and meals definition
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
of hotel to just on places that are
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
easier for the towns
 
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
to um to um talk with and um uh get by
 
00:46:53.589 --> 00:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
in from uh ins motels lodging rooms
 
00:46:55.870 --> 00:46:55.880 align:start position:0%
lodging homes rooming houses boarding
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
houses and
 
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
hostels there um and then it defines
 
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
occupant um the nor the way that rooms
 
00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
and meals does but it it says that um
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
should we be talking about the amendment
 
00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
now the initial motion is still on the
 
00:47:18.349 --> 00:47:18.359 align:start position:0%
floor well you told me I could talk
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
about the amendment so I I I did I did
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
tell her she could talk about the
 
00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:27.079 align:start position:0%
amendment um and uh I I I would just but
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
I would just um also say that I think
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
the arguments have been pretty well laid
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
out I think we know where this is going
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
right um
 
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
so if you want to make one last
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
statement on it uh well just say that
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
um it can't if uh that it keeps FL flop
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%

00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%

there'll be there will be a report for
 
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
itel and a report against it so majority
 
00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
report will be by um representative
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
spillsbury because that was the motion
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
okay and the Minority Report will be by
 
00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:04.549 align:start position:0%
okay and the Minority Report will be by
represent

00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
Aly okay Mr chair I'm gonna close the
 
00:50:08.079 --> 00:50:12.789 align:start position:0%
Aly okay Mr chair I'm gonna close the
exact

00:50:12.789 --> 00:50:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
session okay since it's
 
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:18.799 align:start position:0%
1010 um I I think the itl motion
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
technically has failed and this is meant
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
to default to an
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
OTP if it's defaulting to an TP should
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
we separately consider the amendment so
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
because I I'm a little confused here
 
00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:36.799 align:start position:0%
should should should it say on the house
 
00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:40.839 align:start position:0%
calendar uh otpa or should it just say
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
OTP how how procedurally how does that
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
work my we may have to check with the
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
clerk um my understanding it's
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
otpa uh and we don't address the
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
amendment no okay no it's not2 it can't
 
00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
be without a vote you can't be with an a
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
until you vote I think the amendment
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
would be introduced on the floor
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
no let's chair yes
 
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
M am representative Ames had his hand up
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
first yeah I I believe the correct
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
procedure is as representative Edward
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
stated that that we we started out with
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
a motion to itl that failed on a 10 to
 
00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
10 vote
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
next up is a motion which hasn't been
 
00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
made to U ought to pass an OTP motion uh
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
which will be followed I understand by a
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
motion to
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
amend and um we'll we have to work
 
00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.910 align:start position:0%
amend and um we'll we have to work
through

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
that probably to another 10 to 10 result
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
and now we're position for the reports
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
that speak to the second part that we
 
00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't that makes that makes sense uh
 
00:51:59.069 --> 00:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
is that what you going to say yeah
 
00:52:02.789 --> 00:52:02.799 align:start position:0%
represent D okay all right um we will
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh so the itl U has failed because
 
00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
there's no uh because it was a TI vote
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
um representative Aly I think we can
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
make this quick I move move what I move
 
00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
on ought to pass with Amendment no to
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
pass ought to pass first right do I have
 
00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:31.470 align:start position:0%
pass ought to pass first right do I have
a

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:34.799 align:start position:0%
second um repres elberger on
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
1254 um would you like to to speak to
 
00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:41.799 align:start position:0%
your motion very quickly yeah I I would
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
just like to um say that on I would like
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
to move uh the UT to pass with amend the
 
00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:54.799 align:start position:0%
amendment okay the amendment being being
 
00:52:54.799 --> 00:52:55.910 align:start position:0%
amendment okay the amendment being being
um

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh 2024
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
right so um does the amendment need to
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
be seconded I believe it does second by
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth on the
 
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
amendment all right we'll give you a
 
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
chance to catch up this is I'm always
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
confused when we do this because I was
 
00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
taught it's ought to pass and then you
 
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:25.720 align:start position:0%
do the Amendments separately so uh but
 
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
you don't do you don't vote on the ought
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
to pass first you vote on ought to pass
 
00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
with the amendment usually yeah always
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
you have to vote on we have to vote on
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment first yeah okay so the
 
00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720 align:start position:0%
motion is uh to uh the amendment
 
00:53:44.349 --> 00:53:44.359 align:start position:0%

00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
recommendations that it
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
says on the and there's an ought to pass
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
with amendment that is explained only
 
00:56:30.349 --> 00:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
inside of the
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
blurb of the report from the a to pass
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
person so I guess that's what we have to
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
do well the motion still is onp only the
 
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
motion would
 
00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:44.950 align:start position:0%
motion would
BEP

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
BEP
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
TP OTP only correct and um then in the
 
00:56:53.589 --> 00:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
blur one refers to the
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
amendment right in the blurb you can
 
00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
refer to the amendment representative
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
Edwards did you I I was just going to
 
00:57:01.789 --> 00:57:01.799 align:start position:0%
say this is really a good uh set of
 
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
questions for the clerk uh because it
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
seems like the the house calendar at
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
this point should say OTP and should
 
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
have the two reports in it uh and
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
because the amendment did not pass uh I
 
00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:17.319 align:start position:0%
don't even know that it uh should be
 
00:57:20.829 --> 00:57:20.839 align:start position:0%
referred to in either report uh it it it
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
does make itself available to be uh
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
introduced on the floor um but but I
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
think just as a matter of clarification
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
the chair may want to talk to the clerk
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
to find out what the rules of including
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
references to the amendment are in the
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
report itself for the house calendar I
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
because I don't know I just it just
 
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:48.440 align:start position:0%
feels to me like a a a gray area
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
there that yeah on the face of it that
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
makes sense thank you representative
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
Edwards we will check with the clerk
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
before putting doesn't seem to be what
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
happens well before we before you write
 
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
up the blurb or before we submit the
 
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
blurb we'll talk to the clerk to find
 
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
out um situation on that representative
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
Southworth uh thank you I know some of
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
its terminology so the buold will say
 
00:58:11.359 --> 00:58:12.710 align:start position:0%
its terminology so the buold will say
without

00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:15.039 align:start position:0%
recommendation and then the first blurb
 
00:58:16.069 --> 00:58:16.079 align:start position:0%
even though they're not calling them
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
blurbs anymore will be for passage or
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
support of the bill and that certainly
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
can mention the amendment um and then
 
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
the second one will be opposed to the
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
bill I I mean the my guess is that the
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
otp's uh well I don't know we have to
 
00:58:34.109 --> 00:58:34.119 align:start position:0%
see what the OTP does because I don't
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
know if the same support is going to
 
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
ensue or not because there was a reason
 
00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
that representa Aly brought an amendment
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
that was concerned with the bill itself
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not sure how that vote's going
 
00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
to go before when it says has said
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
without recommendation certainly um the
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
um supportive section can reference an
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
amendment that made the bill better I
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
mean I have seen that before because why
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
would you do it differently if it's 101
 
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
yeah no I I I understand your point I
 
00:59:09.029 --> 00:59:09.039 align:start position:0%
don't want to argue it here because we
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
don't know we'll check CL have the final
 
00:59:14.190 --> 00:59:14.200 align:start position:0%
say uh representative PL I would imagine
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
the people uh put putting forth the OTP
 
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
could have a floor Amendment which
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
exists which is the same Amendment but
 
00:59:23.789 --> 00:59:23.799 align:start position:0%
introduced as a floor Amendment yeah
 
00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
they definitely could representa Aly
 
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
could if she wants introduce it as a
 
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.069 align:start position:0%
could if she wants introduce it as a
floor

00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
amendment I could but then people
 
00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't read
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
it okay any uh any discussion on the
 
00:59:37.309 --> 00:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
bill itself because that's all we're
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
looking at now representative ducet Mr
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
chair I just contacted the uh the clerk
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
he's going to take a run over here and
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
and help us straighten out this black
 
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
Meer so perfect if you want to hold so
 
00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:51.430 align:start position:0%
Meer so perfect if you want to hold so
maybe

00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
we all right we will uh oh he might be
 
00:59:55.359 --> 00:59:58.549 align:start position:0%
we all right we will uh oh he might be
here

00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
no timing was right what we need is
 
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
someone education because they always do
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
this can I re I don't think you close
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.109 --> 01:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
I okay all right I'm going to uh recess
 
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
HB 1254 temporarily while we wait for
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
the clerk to arrive um and this could be
 
01:00:21.839 --> 01:00:23.549 align:start position:0%
the clerk to arrive um and this could be
him

01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
him
 
01:00:27.549 --> 01:00:27.559 align:start position:0%
perfect perfect timing I'm not going to
 
01:00:30.029 --> 01:00:30.039 align:start position:0%
recess hp1
 
01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
1254 okay so the question at hand so we
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
the motion was itl on HB 1254 the vote
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
was 1010 so the itl failed uh we then
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
went to uh
 
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
OTP and um an amendment was introduced
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
the amendment then failed 1010 so now we
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
are back to OT P just the bill which we
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
have not voted on that's where we are at
 
01:01:01.270 --> 01:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
right now and then we had some questions
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
about um how this should appear let's
 
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
say the vote now well actually we I
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
don't maybe we should vote on the OTP
 
01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
but good morning good morning uh you're
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
going to want to vote on the OTP if the
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
OTP fails
 
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
then you can submit without
 
01:01:29.309 --> 01:01:29.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation and you can have either
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh statement in support of ought to pass
 
01:01:32.910 --> 01:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with Amendment two ought
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
to pass with amendments itl
 
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:38.839 align:start position:0%
whatever okay and then um Can the
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
amendment be referred to in the in the
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
um blurb or not in the report uh you can
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
you can refer to an amendment that would
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
do something but you you don't we don't
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
list uh numbers specifically in
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
committee reports okay so just the idea
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
of what the amendment would do MH okay
 
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
um yes uh who's representative
 
01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.029 align:start position:0%
um yes uh who's representative
spillsbury

01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
spillsbury
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
so I understand an amendment can then be
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
brought up on the floor but it would not
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
be characterized as a committee
 
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment it would have to be brought as
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
a floor Amendment no it can be
 
01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
transmitted as uh it's B basically half
 
01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:22.839 align:start position:0%
the committee supports an amendment and
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
that the the positive motion goes first
 
01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
recommendation represent PL I have a
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
clerk question I I went through clerk
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
School beginning of this term I recall
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes uh but and what I learned there is
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
when a case like this I I wrote ought to
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
pass but then adoption of amendment
 
01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:46.279 align:start position:0%
number on the same line and so the
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
chairman asked for uh ought to pass for
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
uh move in second but that doesn't apply
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
I the the ought to pass for Amendment as
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
what I put down was represents Aly and
 
01:03:02.670 --> 01:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
Southworth the amendment failed so then
 
01:03:05.309 --> 01:03:05.319 align:start position:0%
I went to a to pass with Aly and
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
elberger which was the uh which who who
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
who going to make the initial motion to
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
a to pass is that correct the the you
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
can only accept an an amendment on a
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
positive motion yes so the person who
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
moves the ought to pass and seconds the
 
01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
ought to pass is the same whether or not
 
01:03:28.309 --> 01:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment is adopted or
 
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
not okay we can we can kits on that
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
later if you need to I don't want to I
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to hold up time all right
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%
fine uh if they were same people it
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't bother me but there's two
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
different sets of people on one
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
line okay all right we'll we clarify

that representative fellows yes I I just
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%

to go in the pocket or can it be printed
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%

82h and what the amendment does is
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
essentially the same bill but Mr chair
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%

you we're still recovering from the last
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
one to

H uh okay would you like to speak yes
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment first all it does is it's
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
this bill is the same but it adds in
 
01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
lines 25 and 26 no char itable
 
01:08:56.669 --> 01:08:56.679 align:start position:0%
organization shall receive less than 35%
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
of the gross revenue from many games of
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
chance minus any prizes paid and that
 
01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
fixes the bill that inadvertently
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
dropped the
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
35% uh so it puts it back into law if we
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
pass it right thank you and the bill
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
itself with that passage uh is
 
01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
essentially eliminating the rents
 
01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:16.839 align:start position:0%

your motion representative
 
01:56:00.430 --> 01:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
erine very simple if we're going to take
 
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
money out of our neighbors Pockets it
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
ought to be something
 
01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
that the majority of us more than just a
 
01:56:12.229 --> 01:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
minor majority but a significant
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
majority agree that is necessary and
 
01:56:20.149 --> 01:56:20.159 align:start position:0%
needed be that money a tax or a fee
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
understanding that in New Hampshire the
 
01:56:26.990 --> 01:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:30.189 --> 01:56:30.199 align:start position:0%

fellows so my neighbors all own homes
 
01:56:40.669 --> 01:56:40.679 align:start position:0%
and their taxes are going to go up
 
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
significantly their their property taxes
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
are going to go up significantly if we
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
pass this bill because it makes it just
 
01:56:50.109 --> 01:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
about impossible to raise money from any
 
01:56:50.119 --> 01:56:52.390 align:start position:0%
about impossible to raise money from any
other

01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%

um I brought up before
 
01:57:17.950 --> 01:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
that if we are asking for a 2third
 
01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
majority to
 
01:57:23.310 --> 01:57:23.320 align:start position:0%
raise taxes or fees then I believe we
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
should be also looking at 2third
 
01:57:29.790 --> 01:57:29.800 align:start position:0%
majority to lower taxes or fees if we
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
are talking about being fiscally
 
01:57:34.229 --> 01:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
responsible we
 
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:37.480 align:start position:0%

01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
about the uh tens of million dollars of
 
01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
increases in EFA account
 
01:57:46.910 --> 01:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
costs that are not covered anywhere in
 
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
the budget the given the vast majority
 
01:57:53.950 --> 01:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
of the students who are getting
 
01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
those uh
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
efas are have never been in public
 
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
school there is no money that the public
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
schools will be transferring into those
 
01:58:07.470 --> 01:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
account so those are new costs to the
 
01:58:12.189 --> 01:58:12.199 align:start position:0%
state with no underlined No statement
 
01:58:15.430 --> 01:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
about where that money is coming from
 
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
and we had the the house passed that
 
01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:20.030 align:start position:0%
and we had the the house passed that
without

01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
any uh statement or plan for covering
 
01:58:27.550 --> 01:58:27.560 align:start position:0%
those the governor uh yesterday
 
01:58:29.390 --> 01:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
announced that he wants to spend almost
 
01:58:33.709 --> 01:58:33.719 align:start position:0%
a million dollars to send New Hampshire
 
01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
National Guardsman to the southern
 
01:58:39.629 --> 01:58:39.639 align:start position:0%
border there is no plan to cover that
 
01:58:43.149 --> 01:58:43.159 align:start position:0%
expense we are going to be school
 
01:58:46.510 --> 01:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that have been so far
 
01:58:46.520 --> 01:58:48.069 align:start position:0%
lawsuits that have been so far
successful

01:58:48.069 --> 01:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:58:49.870 --> 01:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
and I
 
01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:50.910 align:start position:0%
and I
don't

01:58:50.910 --> 01:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
see that asking our local property
 
01:59:00.069 --> 01:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to cover costs that are being
 
01:59:03.790 --> 01:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
incurred by the state without any plan
 
01:59:07.069 --> 01:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
on the state's part about how to
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
increase the funding and requiring then
 
01:59:13.270 --> 01:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
a 2third majority to come up with a plan
 
01:59:16.669 --> 01:59:16.679 align:start position:0%
makes any sense at all I see this as an
 
01:59:20.589 --> 01:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
irresponsible fiscally irresponsible POS
 
01:59:22.830 --> 01:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
uh recommendation and I will be voting
 
01:59:25.310 --> 01:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
very strongly against it and speaking to
 
01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
my constituents along those lines thank
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you anybody else
 
01:59:36.189 --> 01:59:36.199 align:start position:0%
representative um May I respond um
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay let me uh we we'll get back to you
 
01:59:41.229 --> 01:59:41.239 align:start position:0%
um representative Lee
 
01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
Lee thank you Mr
 
01:59:47.069 --> 01:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
chair um just want to reframe the idea
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
of taking I don't believe that tax ation
 
01:59:54.550 --> 01:59:54.560 align:start position:0%
is theft or taking I believe that I was
 
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
handed many things when I was born and
 
02:00:00.390 --> 02:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
when I as I move about in the state I am
 
02:00:04.270 --> 02:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
given things like a road that gets me up
 
02:00:06.589 --> 02:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
here to the state house this chair that
 
02:00:09.629 --> 02:00:09.639 align:start position:0%
I sit on this table that I sit at I
 
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
think it was purchased by the last
 
02:00:15.149 --> 02:00:15.159 align:start position:0%
generation of taxpayers and I feel like
 
02:00:18.550 --> 02:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
it was a gift to me a gift to all of us
 
02:00:19.709 --> 02:00:19.719 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
and what we are asked is to Simply pay
 
02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:23.510 align:start position:0%
and what we are asked is to Simply pay
it

02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
forward so that I I don't have to buy
 
02:00:28.830 --> 02:00:28.840 align:start position:0%
this chair the last generation of
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayers bought it but it's fair that I
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
pay for upkeep for the Next Generation
 
02:00:40.350 --> 02:00:40.360 align:start position:0%
so I feel like if we refuse to pay taxes
 
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
we're refusing in fact to pay back what
 
02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:45.560 align:start position:0%
we already took and we're taking from
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
the Next Generation so I feel like we
 
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:51.679 align:start position:0%
can frame this however we want but there
 
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
is no such thing as a free lunch and I
 
02:00:56.430 --> 02:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
think that there is a balance right now
 
02:00:59.229 --> 02:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
if we want to make changes in taxation
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
or in spending we have to have a
 
02:01:04.310 --> 02:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
majority to make that decision and I
 
02:01:08.750 --> 02:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
think that that has served us well um so
 
02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
far in New Hampshire history and I'm not
 
02:01:13.109 --> 02:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
ready to make that change so I will be
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
voting no on OTP thank you thank you um
 
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
represent El did you want to say
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
something okay representative
 
02:01:27.069 --> 02:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you uh this is totally
 
02:01:27.079 --> 02:01:28.350 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you uh this is totally
fiscally

02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
fiscally
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
irresponsible on you are looking at
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
having the General Court decide by 23s
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
whether to pay the pr interest in
 
02:01:41.589 --> 02:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
installments of principal of all state
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
bonds that is going to destroy our
 
02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:46.470 align:start position:0%
bonds that is going to destroy our
credit

02:01:46.470 --> 02:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
credit
 
02:01:49.709 --> 02:01:49.719 align:start position:0%
rating and increase
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
the costs of government by a huge amount
 
02:01:53.599 --> 02:01:54.910 align:start position:0%
the costs of government by a huge amount
um

02:01:54.910 --> 02:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
2/3 is not a
 
02:02:03.149 --> 02:02:03.159 align:start position:0%
democracy 2/3 is uh ruled by a
 
02:02:05.870 --> 02:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
minority this
 
02:02:05.880 --> 02:02:07.950 align:start position:0%
minority this
uh

02:02:07.950 --> 02:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:09.629 align:start position:0%
uh
legislation

02:02:09.629 --> 02:02:09.639 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:02:14.510 --> 02:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
to avoid any increases when increases
 
02:02:19.390 --> 02:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
turn out to be necessary on is not
 
02:02:23.229 --> 02:02:23.239 align:start position:0%
something that could pass with 2/3
 
02:02:25.950 --> 02:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
unless it was something like a nuclear
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
bomb it hit the state uh we went through
 
02:02:32.589 --> 02:02:32.599 align:start position:0%
this in
 
02:02:36.270 --> 02:02:36.280 align:start position:0%
1999 when we spent eight hours on the
 
02:02:40.030 --> 02:02:40.040 align:start position:0%
floor in in
 
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh the rep's hall trying to get through
 
02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
something that would pay $800 million
 
02:02:51.229 --> 02:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
for educ ation funding even though we
 
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
had all sorts of gimmicks in it a third
 
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
of it was the educ was the uh Statewide
 
02:03:02.189 --> 02:03:02.199 align:start position:0%
education property tax so that uh we
 
02:03:04.030 --> 02:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
weren't really paying it it was being
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
paid by local
 
02:03:05.639 --> 02:03:07.229 align:start position:0%
paid by local
taxpayers

02:03:07.229 --> 02:03:07.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
02:03:10.589 --> 02:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
um and um there were all sorts of other
 
02:03:12.990 --> 02:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
things in it they came in they went out
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
we argued back and forth for eight hours
 
02:03:19.390 --> 02:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
we were locked in until midnight
 
02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh it must might have been more than
 
02:03:25.149 --> 02:03:25.159 align:start position:0%
eight hours uh and we just and we
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
managed barely to pass it but we didn't
 
02:03:27.599 --> 02:03:29.510 align:start position:0%
managed barely to pass it but we didn't
need

02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
2/3 2/3 probably even back then when
 
02:03:38.830 --> 02:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
Republicans were more
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
Progressive uh would have been just
 
02:03:42.239 --> 02:03:43.589 align:start position:0%
Progressive uh would have been just
about

02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:03:47.990 --> 02:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
impossible and um I think this is a
 
02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
request to to destroy our state and I'm
 
02:03:54.430 --> 02:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:58.189 --> 02:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
against anything else any other
 
02:04:00.990 --> 02:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
comments yes represent
 
02:04:04.549 --> 02:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
elberger just to clarify because I saw a
 
02:04:07.629 --> 02:04:07.639 align:start position:0%
couple of uh immediate reactions when
 
02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative Aly was talking about
 
02:04:13.350 --> 02:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
control by a minority what this means if
 
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
this is passed is that
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
onethird of the house
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
can control a
 
02:04:29.950 --> 02:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
budget if there is not one3 Plus or 2/3
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
plus who vote to raise taxes or fees or
 
02:04:40.470 --> 02:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
add new ones then in fact a minority of
 
02:04:43.390 --> 02:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
the reps are in
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
control it's not a responsible way for
 
02:04:47.589 --> 02:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
us to behave thank
 
02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:58.589 --> 02:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
Ames when we discussed this before I uh
 
02:05:02.549 --> 02:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
made the point that uh this state has
 
02:05:05.950 --> 02:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
functioned um reasonably well with its
 
02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
ups and downs for uh centuries and um it
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
has done so with a simple majority rule
 
02:05:19.229 --> 02:05:19.239 align:start position:0%
on most matters um apart from amending
 
02:05:24.510 --> 02:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
the Constitution itself and um that uh
 
02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
the matters that come before this body
 
02:05:31.149 --> 02:05:31.159 align:start position:0%
are complex and difficult um and uh
 
02:05:35.470 --> 02:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
sorting out uh the pros and cons is uh a
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
challenge for all of us um in the end
 
02:05:44.589 --> 02:05:44.599 align:start position:0%
resolving those choices uh by a uh a
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
simple majority 50 50% plus one um is
 
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
the way we've done it uh we being the
 
02:05:54.189 --> 02:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire over the
 
02:05:59.189 --> 02:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
years and um I see no reason whatsoever
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
to um move away from that uh that really
 
02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
remarkable history of a functioning
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
democracy so um I I hope uh in the end
 
02:06:13.470 --> 02:06:13.480 align:start position:0%
that we'll find our way to say no to
 
02:06:16.870 --> 02:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
this uh I agree I'm sorry to label it
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
this way but I think it's absolutely
 
02:06:20.910 --> 02:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
true with this uh fiscally
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
irresponsible uh
 
02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:26.270 align:start position:0%
irresponsible uh
proposal

02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
02:06:29.870 --> 02:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay all right seeing no more oh one
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
more hand there representative
 
02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
ery last comment if you will
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
sir um there's absolutely nothing in
 
02:06:39.790 --> 02:06:39.800 align:start position:0%
this bill that prevents an increase in
 
02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
taxes and nothing in this bill prevents
 
02:06:45.149 --> 02:06:45.159 align:start position:0%
the payment of uh due
 
02:06:50.910 --> 02:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
debts uh this bill using a super
 
02:06:54.510 --> 02:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
majority reflects the operation of a
 
02:06:57.149 --> 02:06:57.159 align:start position:0%
republic which is what we
 
02:07:03.229 --> 02:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
are 2/3 is not a u minority and to say
 
02:07:06.669 --> 02:07:06.679 align:start position:0%
that the one-third is
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
controlling an uh the the the body one
 
02:07:13.470 --> 02:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
must remember that right
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
now five votes five people
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
control much rather have a
 
02:07:21.239 --> 02:07:23.430 align:start position:0%
control much rather have a
discussion

02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
between a hundred people and their point
 
02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:27.149 align:start position:0%
between a hundred people and their point
of

02:07:27.149 --> 02:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:07:29.549 --> 02:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
view rather than have a discussion with
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
five people who say absolutely no and
 
02:07:31.679 --> 02:07:32.750 align:start position:0%
five people who say absolutely no and
will

02:07:32.750 --> 02:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:07:36.069 --> 02:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
not discuss one way or another because
 
02:07:38.669 --> 02:07:38.679 align:start position:0%
they are the ones that know what's
 
02:07:41.229 --> 02:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
best this type of Bill
 
02:07:43.870 --> 02:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
prevents the minority from
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
controlling and make sure that the
 
02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
majority has a chance to present itself
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
position it all
 
02:07:55.109 --> 02:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
when one talks about important
 
02:07:57.549 --> 02:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
activities of the
 
02:08:01.390 --> 02:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
legislature is most certainly true that
 
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
our constitution is the primary and
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
amending the Constitution has a a very
 
02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:09.310 align:start position:0%
amending the Constitution has a a very
high

02:08:09.310 --> 02:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:12.109 --> 02:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
threshold the second most important
 
02:08:15.149 --> 02:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
thing is how much money we impose to be
 
02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
taken from our neighbors this does not
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
in increase property taxes property
 
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
taxes are assessed at a local
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
level local the the local communities
 
02:08:30.830 --> 02:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
can and should not rely upon larest from
 
02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
the state but should rely upon their own
 
02:08:38.109 --> 02:08:38.119 align:start position:0%
activ uh efforts to pave the roads or
 
02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
whatever the state when it has access
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
funds makes that available the state
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
through a variety of programs such as
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms which we discussed
 
02:08:49.229 --> 02:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
earlier share
 
02:08:53.270 --> 02:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
burden I don't see how this could be
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
called fiscally irresponsible when it
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:10.589 --> 02:09:10.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
you I can kind of guess what some of the
 
02:09:15.830 --> 02:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
responses might be but um let's you know
 
02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
try to stick to new areas
 
02:09:22.189 --> 02:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
representative ORS thank you Mr chair I
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that we are not a
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
democracy we are a republic thank you
 
02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:28.669 align:start position:0%
democracy we are a republic thank you
very

02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:09:36.750 --> 02:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:42.870 --> 02:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
elberger we impose taxes to provide for
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
the common good whether it's to pave our
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
roads plow our roads
 
02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
protect our air protect the
 
02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
water educate our
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
children we see those as our
 
02:10:00.430 --> 02:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities some of those things
 
02:10:03.589 --> 02:10:03.599 align:start position:0%
are in fact embodied in the Constitution
 
02:10:03.599 --> 02:10:06.030 align:start position:0%
are in fact embodied in the Constitution
state

02:10:06.030 --> 02:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:09.709 --> 02:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
constitution the notion
 
02:10:13.990 --> 02:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
that there would be no impact on the tax
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:20.549 --> 02:10:20.559 align:start position:0%
citizens and specifically with regard to
 
02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:22.639 align:start position:0%
to property
 
02:10:26.990 --> 02:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
taxes doesn't make sense in my mind
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
every time we
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
cut taxes that the state levies that
 
02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
support local
 
02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
Services yes the state is not paying for
 
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
those services but I haven't heard
 
02:10:43.549 --> 02:10:43.559 align:start position:0%
anybody saying we don't need to provide
 
02:10:45.870 --> 02:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
services we don't need to plow our roads
 
02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
we don't need to pave our roads we don't
 
02:10:49.390 --> 02:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
need to do any of those those things
 
02:10:52.149 --> 02:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
until and unless we are willing to say
 
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
we don't care about providing those
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
Services we can manage without them then
 
02:11:00.589 --> 02:11:00.599 align:start position:0%
we need to pay taxes in order to do that
 
02:11:03.910 --> 02:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
when we are not providing State funds to
 
02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:06.270 align:start position:0%
when we are not providing State funds to
our

02:11:06.270 --> 02:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:11:08.669 --> 02:11:08.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities those municipalities want
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
to maintain services and there is no
 
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
alternative to them other than to raise
 
02:11:19.069 --> 02:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
property taxes those are connect
 
02:11:22.109 --> 02:11:22.119 align:start position:0%
whether we like that idea or
 
02:11:25.189 --> 02:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
not and we need to be honest and
 
02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
recognize that that's the case thank
 
02:11:30.629 --> 02:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
you representative Aly and then
 
02:11:30.639 --> 02:11:32.510 align:start position:0%
you representative Aly and then
representative

02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:11:35.870 --> 02:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
Edwards thank you um we all know this
 
02:11:38.270 --> 02:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
bill is not going to pass because it is
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
not going to get 2third in the
 
02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:42.790 align:start position:0%
not going to get 2third in the
legislature

02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:11:47.310 --> 02:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
um I uh I would like to just mention
 
02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
that we are talking talking about small
 
02:11:54.109 --> 02:11:54.119 align:start position:0%
D and small R de democracy in Republic
 
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
and we are both
 
02:12:00.510 --> 02:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
um our constitution is framed that way
 
02:12:05.229 --> 02:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
you may try to change it so that we
 
02:12:10.589 --> 02:12:10.599 align:start position:0%
aren't any longer but um we are one in
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
which a majority vote me me means
 
02:12:17.430 --> 02:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
majority vote it doesn't mean that on
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
you can't do
 
02:12:24.589 --> 02:12:24.599 align:start position:0%
something because a third are against it
 
02:12:29.229 --> 02:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
um I would just appeal to my
 
02:12:33.790 --> 02:12:33.800 align:start position:0%
colleagues to think about what kind of
 
02:12:37.589 --> 02:12:37.599 align:start position:0%
state we would be if we only had the
 
02:12:37.599 --> 02:12:38.790 align:start position:0%
state we would be if we only had the
richest

02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
richest
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
communities in the
 
02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
state and there were no other people in
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
this state thank
 
02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
02:12:53.310 --> 02:12:53.320 align:start position:0%
Edwards yeah thank you Mr chair I I I
 
02:12:56.030 --> 02:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
hadn't expected to hear much discussion
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
in this bill related to uh the need for
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
government to provide services because
 
02:13:04.830 --> 02:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
this is not an amendment dealing with
 
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
services this is an amendment dealing on
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
how we should handle new
 
02:13:14.669 --> 02:13:14.679 align:start position:0%
taxes not existing taxes but new taxes
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
and so the debate to me would properly
 
02:13:18.750 --> 02:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
be focused
 
02:13:22.109 --> 02:13:22.119 align:start position:0%
on the right mechanisms in a in a
 
02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
society to raise new taxes and and what
 
02:13:30.589 --> 02:13:30.599 align:start position:0%
I've not heard from anyone is the
 
02:13:33.750 --> 02:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental respect that we should have
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
for people who engage in the economy
 
02:13:42.189 --> 02:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
create things produce wealth and do it
 
02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
at Great sacrifice to themselves and to
 
02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:45.990 align:start position:0%
at Great sacrifice to themselves and to
their

02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
families to so that they can take care
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
of themselves we we we should not expect
 
02:13:55.990 --> 02:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
government to be sitting back looking at
 
02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:56.870 align:start position:0%
government to be sitting back looking at
the

02:13:56.870 --> 02:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:00.069 --> 02:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
production uh of that individual those
 
02:14:03.549 --> 02:14:03.559 align:start position:0%
individuals as though their perception
 
02:14:05.549 --> 02:14:05.559 align:start position:0%
of the common
 
02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
good somehow gets confused with the
 
02:14:15.390 --> 02:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
common possession of wealth and I you
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
know I I I think people should pay taxes
 
02:14:22.229 --> 02:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
but I think we should do it respectfully
 
02:14:26.030 --> 02:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
realizing that government at its core is
 
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
a force is is a CO of force and one of
 
02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
the things we ought to be doing is
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
dampening the urge of individuals to use
 
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
that coercive
 
02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
Force to do damage and and The Taking of
 
02:14:48.510 --> 02:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
resources from an individual or a family
 
02:14:50.430 --> 02:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
is damaging and I don't know that we
 
02:14:52.430 --> 02:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
should pretend that it isn't because it
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:00.109 --> 02:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
you representative duet thank you Mr
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
chair and as as much as I don't want to
 
02:15:04.950 --> 02:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
speak on this I'll be very very brief I
 
02:15:07.470 --> 02:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
think if we've learned one thing in this
 
02:15:12.750 --> 02:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
very evenly divided house session is
 
02:15:15.069 --> 02:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
that a lot of things can happen
 
02:15:16.589 --> 02:15:16.599 align:start position:0%
dependent on
 
02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
attendance okay and the standard to
 
02:15:23.229 --> 02:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
raise and imp Implement new taxes being
 
02:15:27.549 --> 02:15:27.559 align:start position:0%
50% plus one to me doesn't make sense we
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
need to we need to find a common ground
 
02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
in this okay it can't be that kind of
 
02:15:34.669 --> 02:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
close and and I'd submit we're not going
 
02:15:36.669 --> 02:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
to get a two-thirds majority on this
 
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
also but I think uh the argument should
 
02:15:41.430 --> 02:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
be made that it there should be a
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
standard that that's attainable other
 
02:15:49.310 --> 02:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
than 50% plus one thank you thank you
 
02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:51.149 align:start position:0%
than 50% plus one thank you thank you
representative

02:15:51.149 --> 02:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:00.229 --> 02:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
chair I'm basing these comments on what
 
02:16:05.109 --> 02:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
this body has done recently I feel like
 
02:16:07.709 --> 02:16:07.719 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is not reality
 
02:16:09.390 --> 02:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
like there's no threat in New Hampshire
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
that we're going to become California or
 
02:16:15.229 --> 02:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
that we're going to become uh Marxist
 
02:16:18.589 --> 02:16:18.599 align:start position:0%
communism what is reality reality that
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
we all
 
02:16:23.709 --> 02:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
share uh is that we just cut a bunch of
 
02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
taxes and that we're proposing to make
 
02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:28.069 align:start position:0%
taxes and that we're proposing to make
it

02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:16:28.079 --> 02:16:30.149 align:start position:0%
it
harder

02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
harder
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
to have any Revenue in the state our
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
committee is required to look at the
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
treasury and to consider the revenue so
 
02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
that this committee would vote to make
 
02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
it almost impossible to raise
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
revenue in the context of just having
 
02:16:55.549 --> 02:16:55.559 align:start position:0%
cut a bunch of taxes where that is not
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
held to the same standard is is not
 
02:17:00.429 --> 02:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
following things to its logical
 
02:17:03.549 --> 02:17:03.559 align:start position:0%
conclusion so we can continue to spend
 
02:17:06.309 --> 02:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
with 50 plus one we continue we can
 
02:17:09.309 --> 02:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
continue to cut taxes with 50 plus one
 
02:17:12.150 --> 02:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
both of which this body has
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
done recently and that we would make
 
02:17:19.309 --> 02:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
this change within the context that we
 
02:17:23.309 --> 02:17:23.319 align:start position:0%
are all living in is not logical so
 
02:17:26.110 --> 02:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
we're saying we're going to H H hold
 
02:17:29.309 --> 02:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
this to an super standard but we're
 
02:17:30.830 --> 02:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
still going to spend and we're still
 
02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
going to cut taxes in the same way we
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
always have it it is not going to lead
 
02:17:40.230 --> 02:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
to a more balanced New Hampshire so I'm
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
G to vote OTP on this and I I hope thank
 
02:17:47.870 --> 02:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to vote against the OTP
 
02:17:48.750 --> 02:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
misspoke um and I hope that we all can
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
think about the big picture nobody likes
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
paying taxes I think it's very
 
02:18:01.349 --> 02:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
immature to have this attitude as
 
02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
Governors we have to pay taxes if we
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
want to reap benefits that make this a
 
02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
civilized Community where we live it it
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
just blows my mind that that we are
 
02:18:18.429 --> 02:18:18.439 align:start position:0%
basically stamping our feet and saying
 
02:18:21.629 --> 02:18:21.639 align:start position:0%
we refuse to pay our fair share which is
 
02:18:24.990 --> 02:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
what this this bill is doing thank
 
02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to take one last comment
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
from representative ORS and then I think
 
02:18:33.669 --> 02:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
we are going to vote on this thank you
 
02:18:36.589 --> 02:18:36.599 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and what I like to say is if I
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
take what
 
02:18:41.309 --> 02:18:41.319 align:start position:0%
representative aim said and if I take
 
02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
what representative ducet
 
02:18:47.150 --> 02:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
said maybe a great way to balance this
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
out would be 2/3 to raise or lower taxes
 
02:18:52.669 --> 02:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
it would give us time like we talked
 
02:18:56.709 --> 02:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
about the other day to let things settle
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
another thought I had was if something's
 
02:19:03.309 --> 02:19:03.319 align:start position:0%
passed like a tax or a cut it couldn't
 
02:19:06.349 --> 02:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
be adjusted again till the next session
 
02:19:09.549 --> 02:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
the next the next election but maybe a
 
02:19:12.150 --> 02:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
great compromise would be to take this
 
02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
2/3 you can't you can't raise taxes
 
02:19:18.190 --> 02:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
without a 2/3 vote and you can't cut
 
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
taxes without a 2/3 vote and then we
 
02:19:23.509 --> 02:19:23.519 align:start position:0%
could see what really what really
 
02:19:26.469 --> 02:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
happens does trickle down really work or
 
02:19:32.629 --> 02:19:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:35.309 --> 02:19:35.319 align:start position:0%
you I'll I'll take represent Ames you'll
 
02:19:38.429 --> 02:19:38.439 align:start position:0%
be the last one I notic only because my
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
name was well I noticed your light was
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
on when I said he's the last one so give
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
you that that was happens now it's to be
 
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
truth truthful um yeah
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh no I don't I don't buy that my
 
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
comments lead to the suggestion that we
 
02:20:00.790 --> 02:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
go with 2/3 and 2/3 and 2/3 um no way
 
02:20:03.230 --> 02:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
I've spoken I've spoken in support of
 
02:20:06.910 --> 02:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
the 50 plus one the majority rule
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
principle that uh has uh stood uh
 
02:20:14.150 --> 02:20:14.160 align:start position:0%

time we've run into this this but we'll
 
02:22:05.469 --> 02:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
we'll just do it and then we'll we'll
 
02:22:05.479 --> 02:22:07.750 align:start position:0%
we'll just do it and then we'll we'll
confirm

confirm
 
02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
later we don't need to vote on itl to
 
02:22:16.429 --> 02:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
get to get a we're going to we're just
 
02:22:19.590 --> 02:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
going to do take I'll vote for the
 
02:22:22.110 --> 02:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
represent I thank you Mr chairman I
 
02:22:23.230 --> 02:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
would I would offer you're going to end
 
02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
up with the same effect it made a
 
02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
difference in that last vote because
 
02:22:28.190 --> 02:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment that somebody may
 
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
or may not voted different but it's
 
02:22:32.750 --> 02:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
going to go with no recommendation and
 
02:22:37.389 --> 02:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:37.399 --> 02:22:39.070 align:start position:0%
 
wayes

02:22:39.070 --> 02:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
wayes
 
02:22:41.630 --> 02:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
Edwards let's just just just so we don't
 
02:22:43.790 --> 02:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
make a mistake because we're not exactly
 
02:22:45.870 --> 02:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
sure I I'd recommend we go ahead and
 
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
take an itl vote get the 1010 out of the
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
way and that way it's in the record
 
02:22:54.270 --> 02:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
it'll still go forward as as a default
 
02:22:56.950 --> 02:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
OTP yeah okay I'm all right with that
 
02:22:58.990 --> 02:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I think let's uh
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
who's making the motion to itl all right
 
02:23:05.590 --> 02:23:05.600 align:start position:0%

02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:14.910 --> 02:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
elberger okay all right the clerk will

02:25:05.670 --> 02:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
um well if we're going to get them in
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
for for the next week then we need to do
 
02:25:10.750 --> 02:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
them now
 
02:25:12.910 --> 02:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
um I mean my preference would be to get
 
02:25:15.550 --> 02:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
them in today before
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
3 um which I'll I mean I'll stick around
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit after we're done here to um
 
02:25:23.710 --> 02:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
but we can discuss
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
individually yeah we we'll discuss
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
individually it's already done all right
 
02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
um ol is setting the standard he's
 
02:25:30.880 --> 02:25:33.070 align:start position:0%
um ol is setting the standard he's
already

02:25:33.070 --> 02:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
done okay I'm going to um so the vote
 
02:25:39.630 --> 02:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
was what 1010 101 either way all right
 
02:25:41.070 --> 02:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the exec session on
 
02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:43.389 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the exec session on
CAC

02:25:43.389 --> 02:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
CAC
 
02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
R15 all right
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
um we have one uh one bill left as I
 
02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
said I'm not going to EXA the last three
 
02:25:55.269 --> 02:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
today on the list here so lastly we will
 
02:25:59.070 --> 02:25:59.080 align:start position:0%
exact HB 1054 and I'll open that exact
 
02:26:01.870 --> 02:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
session now I'll recognize
 
02:26:05.910 --> 02:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh roord for a which one
 
02:26:08.309 --> 02:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
oh 10
 
02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
1054 okay I move uh itl on HB
 
02:26:18.070 --> 02:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
1054 do I have a second
 
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
second by representative ores would you
 
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion yes thank
 
02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
02:26:28.030 --> 02:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
um I think it's important to really look
 
02:26:32.910 --> 02:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
at what 1054 does and does not do so I
 
02:26:36.349 --> 02:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
know that it's uh the issue of borders
 
02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
and border crossings and Patrol
 
02:26:41.389 --> 02:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement and whose job it is and
 
02:26:45.150 --> 02:26:45.160 align:start position:0%
whose job it isn't can really cloud this
 
02:26:48.710 --> 02:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
issue but the issue at hand with 1054 is
 
02:26:51.950 --> 02:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
really do we lapse a fund or we do not
 
02:26:54.830 --> 02:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
do we not lapse a fund this fund that
 
02:26:58.429 --> 02:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
we're talking about um was just created
 
02:27:00.550 --> 02:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
in the last budget so it's been only
 
02:27:01.870 --> 02:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
active since
 
02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
July we're finding that there are
 
02:27:08.550 --> 02:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
unexpended funds in the budget
 
02:27:12.309 --> 02:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
and the people making an argument for
 
02:27:14.309 --> 02:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
lapsing this fund would point to those
 
02:27:16.990 --> 02:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
unexpended funds currently but the
 
02:27:19.550 --> 02:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
reality is we've only had access the
 
02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
state has only been spending those funds
 
02:27:22.429 --> 02:27:22.439 align:start position:0%
for six
 
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
months when you add on the fact that
 
02:27:28.110 --> 02:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
Jael car only adopted the rules for this
 
02:27:29.429 --> 02:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
program in
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
November it really isn't an accurate
 
02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
picture on
 
02:27:37.790 --> 02:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
on if if we're on track to expend These
 
02:27:40.030 --> 02:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
funds furthermore my colleague from
 
02:27:41.870 --> 02:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
holderness yesterday brought up a good
 
02:27:43.790 --> 02:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
point she did the research she said
 
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
these funds are going to be used for
 
02:27:47.630 --> 02:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
things like overtime
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
so if we're six months into a a two-year
 
02:27:52.990 --> 02:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
fund there's no way that we can
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate whether or not overtime will
 
02:27:57.309 --> 02:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
be expended now or
 
02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
later so I think that I can speak for
 
02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
many of my colleagues in the fact that
 
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want money sitting around and
 
02:28:09.670 --> 02:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
we don't want money that's earmarked for
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
for a certain issue and not getting
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
spent to to go unspent but the reality
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
with 10
 
02:28:20.910 --> 02:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
54 is that repealing this particular
 
02:28:23.469 --> 02:28:23.479 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund is a premature action at
 
02:28:28.269 --> 02:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
this time so with that I would uh again
 
02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
reemphasize my motion for inexpedient to
 
02:28:36.389 --> 02:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you um other comments
 
02:28:41.309 --> 02:28:41.319 align:start position:0%
representative elme yes as I understand
 
02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
the bill it is not repealing this fund
 
02:28:50.429 --> 02:28:50.439 align:start position:0%
what it is doing is saying that the
 
02:28:53.309 --> 02:28:53.319 align:start position:0%
excess that hasn't been spent at the end
 
02:28:57.790 --> 02:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
of each bium is going to be lapsed to
 
02:29:00.269 --> 02:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
the general
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
fund that's a quite a different thing
 
02:29:04.590 --> 02:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
from repealing
 
02:29:07.990 --> 02:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
it that is simply saying that the next
 
02:29:11.230 --> 02:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
budget if they are needing continuing
 
02:29:13.309 --> 02:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
money and have shown that they need the
 
02:29:17.830 --> 02:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
money will have to have the amount
 
02:29:20.309 --> 02:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh that is needed for that
 
02:29:24.110 --> 02:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:27.070 --> 02:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
budget and that's the situation right
 
02:29:30.190 --> 02:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
now except that they say that you can
 
02:29:32.910 --> 02:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
build up a kitty over the years which
 
02:29:35.790 --> 02:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety in the past has
 
02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
been really good
 
02:29:42.790 --> 02:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
at thank you representative PL I accept
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
everything representative Aly said as
 
02:29:48.269 --> 02:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
true ever I think the argument is it's
 
02:29:51.590 --> 02:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
only been a few months and uh that we
 
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
should give this a couple of years
 
02:29:56.269 --> 02:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
before we talk about uh uh putting
 
02:29:57.670 --> 02:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
putting the money back into the general
 
02:30:00.870 --> 02:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
fund we just have no track recet right
 
02:30:03.950 --> 02:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
now represent roord yes I thank you Mr
 
02:30:06.469 --> 02:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
chair I apologize if I if I
 
02:30:09.309 --> 02:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
misrepresented uh um I understand what
 
02:30:12.630 --> 02:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
the bill does and and and I'm not asking
 
02:30:14.349 --> 02:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
and the bill does not repeal the fund
 
02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
and I apologize to my colleagues here if
 
02:30:20.670 --> 02:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
I uh I made that implied that but um
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative Aly is exactly right the
 
02:30:26.389 --> 02:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
B the focus of the bill is do the funds
 
02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
lapse or do they not lapse do they do
 
02:30:30.870 --> 02:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
they build up or they do not do they not
 
02:30:33.429 --> 02:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
build up and the point that I was making
 
02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
is you know I don't think that we I
 
02:30:36.790 --> 02:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
think we have a responsibility if they
 
02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
are building up to return them to the
 
02:30:42.030 --> 02:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
general fund but the point here is this
 
02:30:43.790 --> 02:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
this fund has only been in existence for
 
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
six months the rules for the the the
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
program were and and how the funds get
 
02:30:50.309 --> 02:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
expended have only been on the book
 
02:30:53.150 --> 02:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
since November so again I I apologize if
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
I I Mis mispoke or misrepresented that
 
02:30:59.550 --> 02:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
um because that was not the intent the
 
02:31:01.429 --> 02:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
intent was exactly what my colleague
 
02:31:04.030 --> 02:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
from Lebanon had said um but again
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
pointing out the fact that it's you know
 
02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
too early to tell whether that's this is
 
02:31:11.590 --> 02:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
needed or not Ren Bolton thank you Mr
 
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
chair so um I retire state after 30
 
02:31:17.510 --> 02:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
years of working for both um d J and and
 
02:31:19.870 --> 02:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of State and every two
 
02:31:22.030 --> 02:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
years basically every agency goes back
 
02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
and and renegotiates uh what they're
 
02:31:27.510 --> 02:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
allocated and they basically put in um a
 
02:31:29.150 --> 02:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
request for either more money or the
 
02:31:33.870 --> 02:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
same money but um there are few uh
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
non-aps funds and if they are non-aps
 
02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
funds then you know those get much more
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
scrutiny they have generally hopefully
 
02:31:45.950 --> 02:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
um at least um a a group of people that
 
02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
oversee see that that are uh unbiased
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
and regardless if this is an important
 
02:31:55.309 --> 02:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
um entity that should survive their
 
02:31:57.150 --> 02:31:57.160 align:start position:0%
funds will get reappropriated every bi
 
02:31:59.590 --> 02:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
Anum and if they need more funds then
 
02:32:01.990 --> 02:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
they'll go back to the legislature and
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
seek more funds and the legislature
 
02:32:07.389 --> 02:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
would probably be sympathetic to that so
 
02:32:10.309 --> 02:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
I think uh allowing it to lapse is
 
02:32:12.910 --> 02:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
probably a very good thing for um this
 
02:32:15.309 --> 02:32:15.319 align:start position:0%
fund and the department of safety so
 
02:32:18.389 --> 02:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Edwards uh thank you
 
02:32:22.510 --> 02:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so the state has no shortage of
 
02:32:25.710 --> 02:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
funds that are non-aps It's Not Unusual
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
to have non-aps and funds generally I
 
02:32:30.469 --> 02:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
want all the funds to lapse so that
 
02:32:34.469 --> 02:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
Finance can take another look at it I
 
02:32:37.349 --> 02:32:37.359 align:start position:0%
finance just debated this uh not too
 
02:32:40.590 --> 02:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
many months ago really and determine
 
02:32:44.349 --> 02:32:44.359 align:start position:0%
that in this case uh having the funds
 
02:32:47.349 --> 02:32:47.359 align:start position:0%
non-aps makes sense because this is a
 
02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
brand new
 
02:32:52.389 --> 02:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
program um requiring the cross
 
02:32:55.309 --> 02:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
coordination of multiple jurisdictions
 
02:32:58.190 --> 02:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
Federal and local doing a number of
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
things to include uh uh refining their
 
02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
communication equipment which can be a
 
02:33:07.110 --> 02:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
longer leadtime procurement uh to
 
02:33:09.550 --> 02:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
coordinate working out coordination
 
02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
techniques and given that the money was
 
02:33:16.469 --> 02:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
just allocated not all that long ago uh
 
02:33:19.030 --> 02:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
would it would be expected for something
 
02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
that complex to take a while to get done
 
02:33:26.030 --> 02:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
and this money was allocated to get a
 
02:33:30.190 --> 02:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
particular project done because it is
 
02:33:33.590 --> 02:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
non-aps all that means is that this
 
02:33:36.469 --> 02:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
project can be
 
02:33:39.070 --> 02:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
completed we can determine in the next
 
02:33:41.870 --> 02:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
budget cycle if additional projects or
 
02:33:44.190 --> 02:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
additional money is needed but the
 
02:33:47.030 --> 02:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
determination was made that this project
 
02:33:49.030 --> 02:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
was vital to New Hampshire and this is
 
02:33:52.070 --> 02:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
the amount of money to do it and the
 
02:33:54.750 --> 02:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
non-aps respects the fact that it's new
 
02:33:56.910 --> 02:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
and we could not anticipate the project
 
02:33:59.630 --> 02:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
management schedule associated with it
 
02:34:02.110 --> 02:34:02.120 align:start position:0%
so I I would recommend that that this
 
02:34:04.910 --> 02:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
bill not uh that that the that this fund
 
02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:06.590 align:start position:0%
bill not uh that that the that this fund
remain

02:34:06.590 --> 02:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
remain
 
02:34:09.950 --> 02:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
non-aps thank you representative fellows
 
02:34:13.750 --> 02:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
um yes I'd like to point out that there
 
02:34:16.190 --> 02:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
are restrictions on how the money in
 
02:34:20.110 --> 02:34:20.120 align:start position:0%
this fund can be used it's restricted to
 
02:34:23.110 --> 02:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
primarily overtime which could be for
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
local local police State Police fishing
 
02:34:29.670 --> 02:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
game or Health and Human Services not
 
02:34:31.510 --> 02:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services Homeland
 
02:34:34.830 --> 02:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
Security and uh it some money can be
 
02:34:37.110 --> 02:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
spent for equipment there's still
 
02:34:41.510 --> 02:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
another whole year to go by in the
 
02:34:43.630 --> 02:34:43.640 align:start position:0%
existing appropriation that they have
 
02:34:46.349 --> 02:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
for the bium which gives them plenty a
 
02:34:48.750 --> 02:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
time to buy their equipment I I don't
 
02:34:50.670 --> 02:34:50.680 align:start position:0%
think they need a huge amount of
 
02:34:54.309 --> 02:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
equipment because you know these these
 
02:34:57.670 --> 02:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
um officers that will be participating
 
02:35:00.830 --> 02:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
already are employees of of either the
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
local or the state and they have their
 
02:35:05.550 --> 02:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
uh equipment in
 
02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
place um and that's the primary and they
 
02:35:13.990 --> 02:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
they don't need they're not trying to
 
02:35:16.510 --> 02:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
build um a new facility
 
02:35:19.230 --> 02:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
that would certainly justify
 
02:35:22.910 --> 02:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
non-lps and they're not um going to be
 
02:35:25.550 --> 02:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
doing anything like a like a new
 
02:35:28.830 --> 02:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
software system or any any major project
 
02:35:30.870 --> 02:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
like that so there's just no reason that
 
02:35:34.750 --> 02:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
it can't be lapsed and the department of
 
02:35:37.269 --> 02:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
safety they will participate in the
 
02:35:39.870 --> 02:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
regular bu budget process and they are
 
02:35:43.469 --> 02:35:43.479 align:start position:0%
going to know what they want to ask for
 
02:35:45.349 --> 02:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
in the different categories in terms of
 
02:35:47.429 --> 02:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
overtime versus equipment and they're
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
the in the best position to do that uh
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
coordinating with their Partners the
 
02:35:56.469 --> 02:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
advantage to collapsing money is that it
 
02:35:59.950 --> 02:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
goes to Surplus and it can be used for
 
02:36:02.830 --> 02:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
things across any of the needs that we
 
02:36:05.070 --> 02:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
have in the state for example right now
 
02:36:07.510 --> 02:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
what are people looking at in terms of
 
02:36:09.870 --> 02:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
how they want we have Surplus and how
 
02:36:12.670 --> 02:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
how would that Surplus be used and the
 
02:36:15.389 --> 02:36:15.399 align:start position:0%
state is facing things like definitely
 
02:36:18.150 --> 02:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
more money is needed for the settlement
 
02:36:21.710 --> 02:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
cases at the um Youth Development Center
 
02:36:25.389 --> 02:36:25.399 align:start position:0%
and there are many other projects and um
 
02:36:28.750 --> 02:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
services that are have a really urgent
 
02:36:31.710 --> 02:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
need for money so that's another reason
 
02:36:35.070 --> 02:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
to uh lapse the money um because it
 
02:36:36.510 --> 02:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
would becomes
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
available and it's excess money that
 
02:36:41.349 --> 02:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
they didn't spend when you get to the
 
02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
end of the bium that can be used for
 
02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:44.870 align:start position:0%
end of the bium that can be used for
other

02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:47.910 align:start position:0%
other
services

02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
represent Aly I have a question for
 
02:36:53.309 --> 02:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
02:36:56.550 --> 02:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
on most of the money as I understand was
 
02:36:58.230 --> 02:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
going to be spent on
 
02:37:03.389 --> 02:37:03.399 align:start position:0%
overtime how is that not a recurring
 
02:37:09.590 --> 02:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
project the project is submitted was
 
02:37:16.590 --> 02:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
defined by getting these multiple
 
02:37:19.469 --> 02:37:19.479 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions working with each other
 
02:37:24.429 --> 02:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
and uh and and securing the
 
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
border which is what a lot of the
 
02:37:31.830 --> 02:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
overtime was for the idea was that by
 
02:37:35.269 --> 02:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
being able to document the illegal
 
02:37:38.190 --> 02:37:38.200 align:start position:0%
traffic coming across the border that
 
02:37:42.309 --> 02:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
that would begin to create a data set
 
02:37:45.790 --> 02:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
upon which a future legislature can make
 
02:37:48.670 --> 02:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
make an informed decision
 
02:37:52.030 --> 02:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
about the extent to which our border is
 
02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
not secure and the extent to which we're
 
02:37:57.510 --> 02:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that the the challenge
 
02:38:00.630 --> 02:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
we had initially is that the federal
 
02:38:04.349 --> 02:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
government maintains all of the data and
 
02:38:07.590 --> 02:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
maintains of of illegal Crossings and
 
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
that data covers um something like 307
 
02:38:15.190 --> 02:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
miles of which the the New Hampshire
 
02:38:19.110 --> 02:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
portion is is but 54 of them and they
 
02:38:22.630 --> 02:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
don't keep track of the data by border
 
02:38:25.070 --> 02:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
segment they just keep track of by the
 
02:38:28.269 --> 02:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
whole length and so uh the finance
 
02:38:30.030 --> 02:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
committee as we looked at this with the
 
02:38:35.110 --> 02:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
AG's request uh we we did not have the
 
02:38:38.990 --> 02:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
the data that would really be useful in
 
02:38:42.469 --> 02:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
future decisions but we believed in the
 
02:38:45.389 --> 02:38:45.399 align:start position:0%
trends we believed in the scenario and
 
02:38:47.710 --> 02:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
so we said okay here's a here's a
 
02:38:51.550 --> 02:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
one-time bullus of $1.4
 
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
million get this coordination get the
 
02:38:57.830 --> 02:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
communication get the surveillance up so
 
02:39:00.269 --> 02:39:00.279 align:start position:0%
that when you come back we have some
 
02:39:03.070 --> 02:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
data upon which to decide what we should
 
02:39:06.110 --> 02:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
do in the future does that answer your
 
02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:07.630 align:start position:0%
do in the future does that answer your
question

02:39:07.630 --> 02:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:39:11.550 --> 02:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
um Yes except that we've got the data
 
02:39:14.790 --> 02:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
now the ACLU extracted it from the
 
02:39:16.349 --> 02:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
02:39:18.190 --> 02:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
on the I'm sorry I'm not going to
 
02:39:20.269 --> 02:39:20.279 align:start position:0%
believe them I I I think we need to
 
02:39:25.550 --> 02:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
sorry well they had a certification from
 
02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
the attorney whatever you call the
 
02:39:35.309 --> 02:39:35.319 align:start position:0%
attorney that represents the federal
 
02:39:38.389 --> 02:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
government in New Hampshire uh that this
 
02:39:43.389 --> 02:39:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:46.550 --> 02:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
HMS I mean it just
 
02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
my thought would be that the when the
 
02:39:52.670 --> 02:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
finance committee took this up they
 
02:39:55.230 --> 02:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
looked into
 
02:39:58.309 --> 02:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
the as as representative Edwards has has
 
02:39:59.510 --> 02:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's a lot of coordination
 
02:40:01.750 --> 02:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
that goes on it's a new fund do make
 
02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
sense that we would give it more time to
 
02:40:07.389 --> 02:40:07.399 align:start position:0%
to settle in um because uh represent
 
02:40:08.910 --> 02:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
Edwards you you made the statement that
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of non-aps yes funds and
 
02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
that it's This Is Not Unusual and
 
02:40:16.269 --> 02:40:16.279 align:start position:0%
especially where it's it's a new fund
 
02:40:18.990 --> 02:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
why are we why are we rushing to to do
 
02:40:20.830 --> 02:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
something why don't we let it settle in
 
02:40:24.230 --> 02:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
and see what happens uh representative
 
02:40:26.710 --> 02:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
02:40:28.990 --> 02:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
leapley followed by representative
 
02:40:32.190 --> 02:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair um am I
 
02:40:34.710 --> 02:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
correct that the motion on the floor
 
02:40:40.349 --> 02:40:40.359 align:start position:0%
is itl yes thank you so the motion on
 
02:40:41.870 --> 02:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
the floor being
 
02:40:47.349 --> 02:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
itl we're proposing that we
 
02:40:52.510 --> 02:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
not look at this fund at the end of this
 
02:40:55.190 --> 02:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
bium that we not
 
02:40:57.590 --> 02:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
question whether we've appropriated the
 
02:41:00.230 --> 02:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
right amount of money that we not
 
02:41:02.070 --> 02:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
question how much more we should
 
02:41:05.309 --> 02:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate in the next bium so what
 
02:41:08.590 --> 02:41:08.600 align:start position:0%
we're proposing is that we let I don't
 
02:41:10.269 --> 02:41:10.279 align:start position:0%
let me just stop you for a second no
 
02:41:12.190 --> 02:41:12.200 align:start position:0%
that's not true all we're saying is it
 
02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:13.150 align:start position:0%
that's not true all we're saying is it
should

02:41:13.150 --> 02:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
should
 
02:41:16.990 --> 02:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
be a well the bill want to be a lapsing
 
02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
fund which means the money goes back so
 
02:41:21.670 --> 02:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
um we're not saying anything about you
 
02:41:22.830 --> 02:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
know whether we're not going to look at
 
02:41:24.790 --> 02:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
it or or things like that it's just this
 
02:41:28.309 --> 02:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
is lapsing versus non-aps and Edward so
 
02:41:30.110 --> 02:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
let me restate and see if I have it
 
02:41:34.110 --> 02:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
right so if we itl this bill we're
 
02:41:38.190 --> 02:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
saying that the the funds should
 
02:41:45.230 --> 02:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
stay in the account so if this project
 
02:41:47.510 --> 02:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
if they spend the money if they don't
 
02:41:50.030 --> 02:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
spend the money the money will sit in
 
02:41:52.630 --> 02:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
their account and then in two years it
 
02:41:54.190 --> 02:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
will sit in the account two years from
 
02:41:57.110 --> 02:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
then it'll sit in the account so we're
 
02:41:57.120 --> 02:41:58.429 align:start position:0%
then it'll sit in the account so we're
not

02:41:58.429 --> 02:41:58.439 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:42:01.710 --> 02:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
automatically allowing the funds to go
 
02:42:05.469 --> 02:42:05.479 align:start position:0%
back into the general fund we are um
 
02:42:09.830 --> 02:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
assuming that the fund is
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
operating as it should be and that the
 
02:42:15.190 --> 02:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation next time should stay at
 
02:42:18.670 --> 02:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
the same amount I don't I would say no I
 
02:42:20.750 --> 02:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'll well I'll let represent Edwards
 
02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
answer that but I thank you this is a
 
02:42:24.830 --> 02:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
one-time allocation of funds for
 
02:42:27.630 --> 02:42:27.640 align:start position:0%
one-time project and the expectation is
 
02:42:29.670 --> 02:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general who started
 
02:42:32.230 --> 02:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
this project uh in the summer is
 
02:42:34.910 --> 02:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
continuing to assertively execute the
 
02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
project and is spending that money down
 
02:42:38.910 --> 02:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that we might be
 
02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
talking about at the end of the budget
 
02:42:43.910 --> 02:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
would be minimal really and all we would
 
02:42:45.950 --> 02:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
be saying is that for the the purposes
 
02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
of this one project that we authorized
 
02:42:51.309 --> 02:42:51.319 align:start position:0%
that they could finish spending it in a
 
02:42:53.510 --> 02:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
normal amount of time now if something
 
02:42:55.469 --> 02:42:55.479 align:start position:0%
bizarre happens and they just quit
 
02:42:57.510 --> 02:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
spending it which I don't anticipate
 
02:43:01.150 --> 02:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
that's very odd they uh then there are
 
02:43:05.230 --> 02:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
ways for that money to be recouped in a
 
02:43:07.710 --> 02:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
future budget cycle but the idea that
 
02:43:08.990 --> 02:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to be
 
02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
leaving money lying about for a while is
 
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
just I I I I just don't see that
 
02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:18.030 align:start position:0%
just I I I I just don't see that
as

02:43:18.030 --> 02:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:43:23.070 --> 02:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
um being a a a a likely
 
02:43:26.309 --> 02:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
scenario so we I I can see
 
02:43:29.150 --> 02:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
opposing I just the purpose of the
 
02:43:32.510 --> 02:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
project but from a money perspective
 
02:43:34.910 --> 02:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
this is not a a money issue at this
 
02:43:37.150 --> 02:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
point it's let's just do the project
 
02:43:39.870 --> 02:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
let's get the data let's find out in
 
02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:41.150 align:start position:0%
let's get the data let's find out in
future

02:43:41.150 --> 02:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:43:44.309 --> 02:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
sessions what the extent is to which our
 
02:43:47.349 --> 02:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:50.469 --> 02:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
violated get the
 
02:43:53.670 --> 02:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
information did you have a followup um I
 
02:43:56.349 --> 02:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify so the the money
 
02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
is a one-time one time it's not a fund
 
02:44:03.469 --> 02:44:03.479 align:start position:0%
that is going to exist in the next banum
 
02:44:07.550 --> 02:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
so it's $1.4 million one time and it's
 
02:44:10.110 --> 02:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
not being reappropriated next time
 
02:44:12.790 --> 02:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
around okay so I'm going to talk about
 
02:44:15.230 --> 02:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
practical and Technical okay and there's
 
02:44:17.269 --> 02:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
going to be a distinction practically
 
02:44:19.389 --> 02:44:19.399 align:start position:0%
what you said is right this is onetime
 
02:44:21.190 --> 02:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
money and it's just going to get spent
 
02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:22.630 align:start position:0%
money and it's just going to get spent
down

02:44:22.630 --> 02:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
down
 
02:44:22.640 --> 02:44:24.190 align:start position:0%
down
okay

02:44:24.190 --> 02:44:24.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:44:26.830 --> 02:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
technically some bureaucrat somewhere
 
02:44:28.950 --> 02:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
has to turn off the fund and that
 
02:44:31.870 --> 02:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
requires a level of of administrative
 
02:44:33.870 --> 02:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
detail that the legislature won't get
 
02:44:36.710 --> 02:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
into but from a practical perspective
 
02:44:39.070 --> 02:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
this is a one-time project and it and
 
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
this money is going to get spun down
 
02:44:45.429 --> 02:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
this is not an open fund for us to to
 
02:44:49.190 --> 02:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
continually appropriate and if we do
 
02:44:52.389 --> 02:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate it's going to be because the
 
02:44:54.750 --> 02:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
finance committee and other committees
 
02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh have received data suggesting that
 
02:45:02.230 --> 02:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
this is useful so uh I I wouldn't assume
 
02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
anything about the future unless you're
 
02:45:06.110 --> 02:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
willing to assume what the future data
 
02:45:08.670 --> 02:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
is going to suggest I I think we will
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:16.070 align:start position:0%
 
discretion

02:45:16.070 --> 02:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
02:45:19.269 --> 02:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
it's uh yes representative elme on does
 
02:45:22.309 --> 02:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
this have a 612
 
02:45:25.750 --> 02:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
number technical detail I don't know be
 
02:45:27.990 --> 02:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
well it's not a technical detail because
 
02:45:31.469 --> 02:45:31.479 align:start position:0%
if it is in 612 the legislature has to
 
02:45:33.630 --> 02:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
actually to get rid of
 
02:45:38.349 --> 02:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
it even and until we get rid of it if
 
02:45:42.510 --> 02:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
there's no further use for it uh then um
 
02:45:48.269 --> 02:45:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:51.190 --> 02:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
books um I mean even if that's true it's
 
02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
not like no one's ever going to look at
 
02:45:54.910 --> 02:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
it I mean we're constantly looking at
 
02:45:57.389 --> 02:45:57.399 align:start position:0%
funds the finance committee no no the
 
02:46:00.110 --> 02:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
finance committee on representative
 
02:46:03.309 --> 02:46:03.319 align:start position:0%
Edward was was right they've got a lot
 
02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
of stuff that they have to do the reason
 
02:46:08.510 --> 02:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
that the dedicated fund committee exists
 
02:46:13.110 --> 02:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
still and is active is that on at least
 
02:46:15.550 --> 02:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
every five years we look
 
02:46:22.790 --> 02:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
at all of the uh of the funds that are
 
02:46:27.469 --> 02:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
on still on the books and we get rid of
 
02:46:30.309 --> 02:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
the ones that are doing nothing and we
 
02:46:33.389 --> 02:46:33.399 align:start position:0%
do something about the funds that don't
 
02:46:34.990 --> 02:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
have enough money in them to do what
 
02:46:37.269 --> 02:46:37.279 align:start position:0%
they were supposed to be doing or have
 
02:46:40.510 --> 02:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
decided like that agricultural one did
 
02:46:41.950 --> 02:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
that they're going to use it for
 
02:46:44.670 --> 02:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
something totally different but the
 
02:46:46.429 --> 02:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
point is it's going to get reviewed it's
 
02:46:48.389 --> 02:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
not it gets reviewed once every five
 
02:46:53.309 --> 02:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
years okay representative uh Elber yeah
 
02:46:55.349 --> 02:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
very briefly the essence of
 
02:46:57.469 --> 02:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
Representative rushford's argument was
 
02:47:00.630 --> 02:47:00.640 align:start position:0%
that it's a premature action none of the
 
02:47:03.469 --> 02:47:03.479 align:start position:0%
prerogatives of the next legislature are
 
02:47:05.630 --> 02:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
in any way curtailed the next
 
02:47:09.750 --> 02:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
legislature can look at the question of
 
02:47:13.550 --> 02:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
lapsing it can look at the um question
 
02:47:15.469 --> 02:47:15.479 align:start position:0%
of eliminating it when
 
02:47:18.110 --> 02:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
inactive or can look at the question of
 
02:47:20.429 --> 02:47:20.439 align:start position:0%
whether further funds and a new
 
02:47:23.070 --> 02:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation are necessary this is a
 
02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:24.510 align:start position:0%
appropriation are necessary this is a
premature

02:47:24.510 --> 02:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
premature
 
02:47:27.269 --> 02:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
action represent
 
02:47:30.790 --> 02:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman I guess
 
02:47:34.429 --> 02:47:34.439 align:start position:0%
that um I must have been ignorant about
 
02:47:37.309 --> 02:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is as representative
 
02:47:40.030 --> 02:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
Edwards points out a one-time project if
 
02:47:43.750 --> 02:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
this is a one-time project presumably it
 
02:47:46.990 --> 02:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:49.349 --> 02:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
date if it's a one-time project you're
 
02:47:51.429 --> 02:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
shaking your head no so if it's a
 
02:47:51.439 --> 02:47:52.670 align:start position:0%
shaking your head no so if it's a
one-time

02:47:52.670 --> 02:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
one-time
 
02:47:55.630 --> 02:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
project how will we know when it's
 
02:47:59.510 --> 02:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
done and what does done mean in the
 
02:48:01.710 --> 02:48:01.720 align:start position:0%
context of this project the AG will
 
02:48:01.720 --> 02:48:04.830 align:start position:0%
context of this project the AG will
inform

02:48:04.830 --> 02:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:07.870 --> 02:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
us I I
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
don't inform us of
 
02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
what you you asked the question and one
 
02:48:15.870 --> 02:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
will we know it'll it done and the AG
 
02:48:18.630 --> 02:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
will inform us this is a high priority
 
02:48:21.469 --> 02:48:21.479 align:start position:0%
special project that people are keeping
 
02:48:23.870 --> 02:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
an eye on this is not something that's
 
02:48:26.389 --> 02:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
being done in the you know mushrooms in
 
02:48:29.950 --> 02:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
the basement this is this the AG is
 
02:48:32.349 --> 02:48:32.359 align:start position:0%
executing this assertively and is
 
02:48:34.910 --> 02:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
maintaining managerial
 
02:48:37.469 --> 02:48:37.479 align:start position:0%
control if if you want to know the
 
02:48:40.230 --> 02:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
status you could call the AG and he'll
 
02:48:43.950 --> 02:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
just tell you this is not a secret that
 
02:48:45.870 --> 02:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
if I'm working on on a
 
02:48:50.190 --> 02:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
project my project has a point it has an
 
02:48:52.750 --> 02:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
outcome and the outcome at least
 
02:48:54.990 --> 02:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
theoretically should be measurable I
 
02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:56.030 align:start position:0%
theoretically should be measurable I
don't

02:48:56.030 --> 02:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:48:59.710 --> 02:48:59.720 align:start position:0%
know how we know when this project is
 
02:49:03.550 --> 02:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
done because we don't know I don't know
 
02:49:05.990 --> 02:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
what the purpose is I was under the
 
02:49:08.990 --> 02:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
impression that this
 
02:49:13.030 --> 02:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
program was to keep track and
 
02:49:16.269 --> 02:49:16.279 align:start position:0%
interdict uh people illegally coming
 
02:49:19.990 --> 02:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire across the
 
02:49:23.590 --> 02:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
border that to me is not a one-time
 
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
project it's an ongoing purpose I assume
 
02:49:32.750 --> 02:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
now that I have this all wrong no
 
02:49:37.070 --> 02:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
so how is that if if I'm accurate I
 
02:49:39.950 --> 02:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
don't understand how this is a one-time
 
02:49:43.349 --> 02:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
project rather than an ongoing
 
02:49:45.990 --> 02:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
activity represent Edward thank you Mr
 
02:49:48.389 --> 02:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
chair the other thing that I said in
 
02:49:52.030 --> 02:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
this meeting is that it's also to fund
 
02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
Communications equipment because as you
 
02:49:56.590 --> 02:49:56.600 align:start position:0%
get up along the northern border there
 
02:49:58.790 --> 02:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
the ability to communicate across
 
02:50:01.710 --> 02:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
International lines and even within New
 
02:50:03.790 --> 02:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Northern borders is
 
02:50:07.870 --> 02:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
extremely limited so so so some amount
 
02:50:10.469 --> 02:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
of the money that's for this project is
 
02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
explicitly for communications equipment
 
02:50:14.830 --> 02:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
and in order to figure out what kind of
 
02:50:16.950 --> 02:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
Communications equipment they needed
 
02:50:20.269 --> 02:50:20.279 align:start position:0%
they would have to work out what sort of
 
02:50:22.670 --> 02:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
international laws or I this is more
 
02:50:25.150 --> 02:50:25.160 align:start position:0%
than I had said before but they have to
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
work out the international complexities
 
02:50:31.229 --> 02:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
of communication law at the border it's
 
02:50:33.710 --> 02:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
a major problem that law enforcement
 
02:50:36.510 --> 02:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
cannot talk to each other up there they
 
02:50:39.349 --> 02:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
cannot do that now so if we get this
 
02:50:41.309 --> 02:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
communication equipment in place these
 
02:50:43.389 --> 02:50:43.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions can coordinate their
 
02:50:46.750 --> 02:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
activities better and create a better uh
 
02:50:49.630 --> 02:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
net to catch illegal
 
02:50:52.229 --> 02:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
Crossings so so we didn't know how long
 
02:50:54.910 --> 02:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
it would take it it it it's being
 
02:50:57.429 --> 02:50:57.439 align:start position:0%
executed and if you'd like I'll call the
 
02:50:59.590 --> 02:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
AG this afternoon and find out the
 
02:51:01.990 --> 02:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
status but the question is should this
 
02:51:05.550 --> 02:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
fund lapse or not and I I I'd say it
 
02:51:07.190 --> 02:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
should not lapse it should let the
 
02:51:10.389 --> 02:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
project execute and and it's it's not
 
02:51:12.590 --> 02:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
like we're going to waste time on
 
02:51:15.750 --> 02:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
it um
 
02:51:18.990 --> 02:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm hearing contradictions it's an
 
02:51:21.389 --> 02:51:21.399 align:start position:0%
ongoing project but it has but it's a
 
02:51:24.070 --> 02:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
one-time project we need the Fone funds
 
02:51:27.150 --> 02:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
ongoing if we need the funds to be
 
02:51:32.030 --> 02:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
ongoing we need to have accountability
 
02:51:33.429 --> 02:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
on those
 
02:51:33.439 --> 02:51:35.790 align:start position:0%
on those
funds

02:51:35.790 --> 02:51:35.800 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:37.389 align:start position:0%
funds
the

02:51:37.389 --> 02:51:37.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:51:43.550 --> 02:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh expenditure was okayed through 2025
 
02:51:45.990 --> 02:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
correct when we passed the budget it was
 
02:51:48.510 --> 02:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
through 2025 Mr
 
02:51:53.750 --> 02:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
chairman represent yes okay so we
 
02:51:56.790 --> 02:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
have almost two
 
02:52:00.349 --> 02:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
years to take a look at what the data
 
02:52:00.359 --> 02:52:02.550 align:start position:0%
years to take a look at what the data
are

02:52:02.550 --> 02:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:52:06.389 --> 02:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any reason
 
02:52:10.550 --> 02:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
to let the funds remain in this account
 
02:52:12.670 --> 02:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
without finding more information about
 
02:52:14.309 --> 02:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
what they've been used for how they
 
02:52:16.830 --> 02:52:16.840 align:start position:0%
might might be needed in the future and
 
02:52:20.550 --> 02:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
we as a legislature can allocate new
 
02:52:24.150 --> 02:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
funding every bium if we believe that it
 
02:52:26.750 --> 02:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be allocated thank
 
02:52:29.790 --> 02:52:29.800 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
02:52:32.389 --> 02:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
fellows so in listening to this
 
02:52:35.990 --> 02:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
conversation I think that some people
 
02:52:38.910 --> 02:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
when they hear onetime project they
 
02:52:42.070 --> 02:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
think of something with a an end date
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
you know something that's going to take
 
02:52:45.469 --> 02:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
two years and then be done and I think
 
02:52:47.950 --> 02:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
that that's probably for the general
 
02:52:50.550 --> 02:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
public not the best way to characterize
 
02:52:53.590 --> 02:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
it I think what this is is you it might
 
02:52:58.070 --> 02:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
be a pilot project or a startup project
 
02:53:01.590 --> 02:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
and that certainly Justified putting uh
 
02:53:05.750 --> 02:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
$1.4 million into their budget but going
 
02:53:08.950 --> 02:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
forward there's no difference there's no
 
02:53:11.670 --> 02:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
impact on what money they will have
 
02:53:15.389 --> 02:53:15.399 align:start position:0%
available to them to spend if this money
 
02:53:18.030 --> 02:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
lapses the money that they haven't spent
 
02:53:21.550 --> 02:53:21.560 align:start position:0%
and haven't obligated obligated lapses
 
02:53:24.030 --> 02:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year and doing that
 
02:53:27.389 --> 02:53:27.399 align:start position:0%
makes it available for other needs that
 
02:53:28.950 --> 02:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
the state will have and this is all
 
02:53:30.389 --> 02:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
something that's going to happen a year
 
02:53:34.070 --> 02:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
from now in the department of safety I
 
02:53:38.110 --> 02:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not sure um why why um
 
02:53:40.630 --> 02:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards um mentioned the
 
02:53:42.750 --> 02:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
AG the budget is actually in the
 
02:53:45.349 --> 02:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
department of safety they would be
 
02:53:47.389 --> 02:53:47.399 align:start position:0%
putting together with input from
 
02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
whomever is necessary their budget and
 
02:53:54.750 --> 02:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
that the issue is it's not they're going
 
02:53:58.630 --> 02:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
to get whatever money they ask for and
 
02:54:01.750 --> 02:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
that the legislature decides that they
 
02:54:05.229 --> 02:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
need and so whether you lapse it or not
 
02:54:07.590 --> 02:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
the only thing that does is makes laps
 
02:54:10.070 --> 02:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
money is available to address other
 
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
needs when it's Surplus it's Surplus
 
02:54:14.349 --> 02:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
they couldn't spend it they couldn't off
 
02:54:16.110 --> 02:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
obligate it they had some money left at
 
02:54:19.349 --> 02:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
the end of the bium that's going to end
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
in July you know June 30th
 
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
20125 and then by that time we will have
 
02:54:30.469 --> 02:54:30.479 align:start position:0%
voted a new budget for that project
 
02:54:34.070 --> 02:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you repres ORS so I just did a
 
02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
search and it says here that more than
 
02:54:39.790 --> 02:54:39.800 align:start position:0%
12,200 migrants were apprehended
 
02:54:43.309 --> 02:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
Crossing illegally from Canada in 2023
 
02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
and up Tock a 200
 
02:54:47.630 --> 02:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
141% with
 
02:54:50.550 --> 02:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
3,578 arrests and then the next one goes
 
02:54:53.469 --> 02:54:53.479 align:start position:0%
on into the New York I'm yeah New York
 
02:54:56.550 --> 02:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
Vermont New Hampshire border which I
 
02:54:59.110 --> 02:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
forget what they called that again the
 
02:55:02.469 --> 02:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
Swanson and then it goes on to say that
 
02:55:05.469 --> 02:55:05.479 align:start position:0%
uh although the numbers for New
 
02:55:08.429 --> 02:55:08.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's border crossing may not be
 
02:55:10.990 --> 02:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
exact and it goes on to qu quote
 
02:55:13.110 --> 02:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
governor sonunu and you know on and on
 
02:55:15.790 --> 02:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
and on so all I'm saying is you know we
 
02:55:19.830 --> 02:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
heard from uh the ACLU that officially
 
02:55:23.070 --> 02:55:23.080 align:start position:0%
two people across the border when you do
 
02:55:24.870 --> 02:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
a search you know we're getting numbers
 
02:55:28.510 --> 02:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
like who knows uh 12 up to 12,000
 
02:55:31.750 --> 02:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
crossing the border and uh so I think
 
02:55:33.830 --> 02:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's obvious this fund is needed for a
 
02:55:36.910 --> 02:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
while probably I mean we can we can uh
 
02:55:38.870 --> 02:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
sit here and kick this can back and
 
02:55:43.190 --> 02:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:43.200 --> 02:55:49.990 align:start position:0%
 
vote

02:55:49.990 --> 02:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.309 align:start position:0%
 
represent

02:55:52.309 --> 02:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:55:54.790 --> 02:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
leapley thank you Mr chair I just want
 
02:55:58.030 --> 02:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
to clarify if if people are watching um
 
02:56:01.229 --> 02:56:01.239 align:start position:0%
at home the what we're voting on is
 
02:56:03.550 --> 02:56:03.560 align:start position:0%
actually the change of two words it's
 
02:56:05.110 --> 02:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
not just lapsing or
 
02:56:11.070 --> 02:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
non-aps it says the the law now it says
 
02:56:14.309 --> 02:56:14.319 align:start position:0%
the fund shall be non-aps and
 
02:56:14.319 --> 02:56:16.550 align:start position:0%
the fund shall be non-aps and
continually

02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
continually
 
02:56:18.710 --> 02:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
appropriated and what we're taking out
 
02:56:21.309 --> 02:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
are the words non-lps and
 
02:56:24.750 --> 02:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
continually so it is about continually
 
02:56:29.429 --> 02:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
enlaps and I I think the feeling is I'm
 
02:56:31.790 --> 02:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
not opposed
 
02:56:35.630 --> 02:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
to the project it's happening I'm
 
02:56:37.349 --> 02:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to the idea that we would
 
02:56:40.469 --> 02:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
continually appropriate money for
 
02:56:42.590 --> 02:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
something that is being presented as a
 
02:56:44.630 --> 02:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
one-time thing
 
02:56:49.550 --> 02:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
and if we want to be running an
 
02:56:55.389 --> 02:56:55.399 align:start position:0%
efficient lean mean State we should be
 
02:56:58.550 --> 02:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
reviewing this kind of spending
 
02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
regularly with each bium especially
 
02:57:04.630 --> 02:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
something that's new so this is new
 
02:57:07.670 --> 02:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
spending we should keep an eye on it
 
02:57:09.870 --> 02:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
great I'm glad we're we're collecting
 
02:57:13.030 --> 02:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
data I want to be a datadriven decision
 
02:57:15.070 --> 02:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
maker but but then that means we have to
 
02:57:16.630 --> 02:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
review the
 
02:57:19.590 --> 02:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
data thank
 
02:57:22.630 --> 02:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
you uh representative PL just say
 
02:57:25.070 --> 02:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as continually
 
02:57:26.830 --> 02:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
because one legislature can't bind
 
02:57:31.469 --> 02:57:31.479 align:start position:0%
another and and so and so next bium when
 
02:57:33.070 --> 02:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
we go through a budget the finance
 
02:57:35.349 --> 02:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
committee can do what it needs to do
 
02:57:37.429 --> 02:57:37.439 align:start position:0%
regardless of what that language is and
 
02:57:39.229 --> 02:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
I I say we've discussed this I'd like to
 
02:57:41.389 --> 02:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
call a question if that's possible very
 
02:57:44.469 --> 02:57:44.479 align:start position:0%
quick clarification yeah continue ually
 
02:57:46.150 --> 02:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
appropriating means that the
 
02:57:49.190 --> 02:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation continues beyond the bium
 
02:57:51.469 --> 02:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
of this 1.4 million it doesn't say you
 
02:57:54.070 --> 02:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
keep one putting another 1.4 million
 
02:57:56.150 --> 02:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
in okay good
 
02:57:59.469 --> 02:57:59.479 align:start position:0%
distinction all right um did you have a
 
02:58:01.830 --> 02:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
question uh represent Malloy earlier
 
02:58:05.309 --> 02:58:05.319 align:start position:0%

03:03:34.750 --> 03:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
can we please put this off to next week
 
03:03:36.349 --> 03:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh that's what I was that's what I just
 
03:03:38.309 --> 03:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
taking recess I think we need to put it
 
03:03:41.830 --> 03:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
off um so we have your Amendment thank
 
03:03:44.790 --> 03:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
you representative Muse um um and uh
 
03:03:48.110 --> 03:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
we'll consider it we'll put this on the
 
03:03:49.870 --> 03:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
list for next
 
03:03:53.269 --> 03:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
week thank you Mr chair the
 
03:03:55.830 --> 03:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
um what the amendment does just so you
 
03:03:59.389 --> 03:03:59.399 align:start position:0%
know is uh the uh Department of
 
03:04:03.389 --> 03:04:03.399 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services uh raised some um
 
03:04:05.510 --> 03:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
significant uh uh questions and
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
objections I think during the public
 
03:04:09.870 --> 03:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
hearing what what this does is
 
03:04:12.870 --> 03:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
effectively address their exemptions it
 
03:04:14.510 --> 03:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
it turn turns the fund that would be
 
03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
created into a non-aps fund uh which was
 
03:04:20.190 --> 03:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest things it also
 
03:04:22.550 --> 03:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
provides more flexibility to the
 
03:04:25.349 --> 03:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Environmental Services
 
03:04:29.750 --> 03:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
to uh to be able uh to essentially uh
 
03:04:32.750 --> 03:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
spend any funds that are left over after
 
03:04:35.790 --> 03:04:35.800 align:start position:0%
the initial uh uh contamination that the
 
03:04:37.630 --> 03:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
settlement was received for has been
 
03:04:40.269 --> 03:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
remediated so if there are leftover
 
03:04:42.429 --> 03:04:42.439 align:start position:0%
funds uh it provides a lot more
 
03:04:45.070 --> 03:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility the than the original Bill
 
03:04:47.670 --> 03:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
around what those funds can be spent on
 
03:04:51.710 --> 03:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
so it still requires that um that the
 
03:04:54.790 --> 03:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
money be spent on remediating or
 
03:04:56.990 --> 03:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
addressing environmental contamination
 
03:05:00.550 --> 03:05:00.560 align:start position:0%
in some way but what it does is it is it
 
03:05:02.469 --> 03:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
puts that within the statutes that apply
 
03:05:03.950 --> 03:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Environmental
 
03:05:05.750 --> 03:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
Services as opposed to Health and Human
 
03:05:08.150 --> 03:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
Services as we had originally and
 
03:05:12.550 --> 03:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
essentially just cleans it up uh so so
 
03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's in a position for you to to
 
03:05:15.910 --> 03:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
consider whether or not it's something
 
03:05:18.309 --> 03:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
we want to adopt as a policy okay great
 
03:05:20.630 --> 03:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for coming today and
 
03:05:24.229 --> 03:05:24.239 align:start position:0%

03:05:26.269 --> 03:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:05:30.429 --> 03:05:30.439 align:start position:0%

reports I'll just go in order that we
 
03:05:38.229 --> 03:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
did them today
 
03:05:40.830 --> 03:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
1254 is
 
03:05:44.750 --> 03:05:44.760 align:start position:0%

03:05:58.630 --> 03:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
thises to write
 
03:06:00.630 --> 03:06:00.640 align:start position:0%

03:06:45.229 --> 03:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:48.710 --> 03:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
um it would be ideal to get as many in
 
03:06:52.510 --> 03:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
today as possible but I realize um it is
 
03:06:52.520 --> 03:06:54.190 align:start position:0%
today as possible but I realize um it is
105

03:06:54.190 --> 03:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
105
 
03:06:54.200 --> 03:06:56.510 align:start position:0%
105
um

03:06:56.510 --> 03:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:01.389 --> 03:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
so so so if are these if you get the
 
03:07:03.750 --> 03:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
reports are they going to when are we
 
03:07:05.190 --> 03:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
going to hear those on the house floor
 
03:07:06.510 --> 03:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't
 
03:07:10.150 --> 03:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
be would it be next week Friday it's
 
03:07:11.710 --> 03:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
Thursday you know speaker would decide
 
03:07:13.710 --> 03:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
but it could be um it could be as early
 
03:07:16.349 --> 03:07:16.359 align:start position:0%
as next Thursday okay but it wouldn't be
 
03:07:17.670 --> 03:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
the one after that because that's a
 
03:07:19.229 --> 03:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
vacation week the one after that the
 
03:07:21.590 --> 03:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
speaker said there'll be no house
 
03:07:24.469 --> 03:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
sessions so if we don't if the report is
 
03:07:27.910 --> 03:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
not in today by 3:00 then these aren't
 
03:07:30.269 --> 03:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
going to be heard until
 
03:07:32.590 --> 03:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
March for the good of the committee can
 
03:07:35.510 --> 03:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
I give an update from
 
03:07:35.520 --> 03:07:37.070 align:start position:0%
I give an update from
General

03:07:37.070 --> 03:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
General
 
03:07:39.229 --> 03:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
sure representative Edwards is going to
 
03:07:41.389 --> 03:07:41.399 align:start position:0%
give us an update from attorney general
 
03:07:44.670 --> 03:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
fora so I text did the Attorney General
 
03:07:46.590 --> 03:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh with some basic questions and he was
 
03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
able to respond in text and I'll just
 
03:07:52.429 --> 03:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
read it um uh to the question of uh are
 
03:07:54.510 --> 03:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
they overseeing the project given that
 
03:07:57.550 --> 03:07:57.560 align:start position:0%
the money is in the public safety budget
 
03:07:59.990 --> 03:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
he says yes we are over seeing going
 
03:08:03.349 --> 03:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
well so far we be began patrols with
 
03:08:06.269 --> 03:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
State Police beginning of December had
 
03:08:08.790 --> 03:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
hoped to start a couple weeks earlier
 
03:08:10.910 --> 03:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
but we spent more time training than we
 
03:08:12.750 --> 03:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
thought because we trained over a 100
 
03:08:17.349 --> 03:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
Troop trouers GNC just approved 519,000
 
03:08:21.030 --> 03:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
for locals a couple of weeks ago so they
 
03:08:24.110 --> 03:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
will join soon after training the money
 
03:08:26.309 --> 03:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
is in the department of safety's budget
 
03:08:28.190 --> 03:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
I don't have a great estimate off the
 
03:08:30.389 --> 03:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
top of my head on when funds will be
 
03:08:32.950 --> 03:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
fully committed but I can get back to
 
03:08:37.790 --> 03:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
you on that so so uh I'll go ahead and
 
03:08:39.429 --> 03:08:39.439 align:start position:0%
ask him to try to come up with an
 
03:08:41.389 --> 03:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
estimate because I think it's just good
 
03:08:44.110 --> 03:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
general information and something that
 
03:08:46.750 --> 03:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
maybe would be useful uh in the house
 
03:08:52.349 --> 03:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:52.359 --> 03:08:54.590 align:start position:0%
 
what

03:08:54.590 --> 03:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:08:58.110 --> 03:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
$519,000 to go to training uh
 
03:09:03.309 --> 03:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:06.550 --> 03:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
million I I I it could it can just be a
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
trans intergovernmental transfer too I
 
03:09:10.790 --> 03:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know the mechanics I don't
 
03:09:17.710 --> 03:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:21.150 --> 03:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
million all right so um yeah given the
 
03:09:24.870 --> 03:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
deadline is 3:00 for me to get in
 
03:09:28.269 --> 03:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
um uh the uh reports committee reports
 
03:09:30.990 --> 03:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
it's a tight time frame if anyone is
 
03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
able to get them done by then it's
 
03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
appreciated because we can get them Mr
 
03:09:38.070 --> 03:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
Cher I sent your mind for
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
1255 okay email yes your email thank
 
03:09:44.590 --> 03:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
you so if if you're able to get them
 
03:09:47.150 --> 03:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
done now or before three I'd appreciate
 
03:09:52.309 --> 03:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
it but yeah uh cacr 15 I would prefer to
 
03:09:57.950 --> 03:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
be able to to um confer with the other
 
03:10:01.950 --> 03:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:06.229 --> 03:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
in can okay okay Mr chairman yeah can I
 
03:10:09.429 --> 03:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
suggest that on the three bills where we
 
03:10:11.870 --> 03:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
divide it evenly that a little bit more
 
03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
time and consideration be given to the
 
03:10:15.269 --> 03:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
reports and that we not try and Rush
 
03:10:17.510 --> 03:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
those onto the calendar for the
 
03:10:20.990 --> 03:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
22nd U it seems that's uh how others
 
03:10:23.229 --> 03:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
feel I think that makes sense um the
 
03:10:26.550 --> 03:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
ones that were um you know 19 to Z 20 to
 
03:10:30.550 --> 03:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
Zer if those reports can be uh done but
 
03:10:32.550 --> 03:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
but if not you know see me I guess see
 
03:10:33.670 --> 03:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
me if you don't think you can get your
 
03:10:36.750 --> 03:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
report done before 3 o'
 
03:10:40.190 --> 03:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
today so you're in including also the
 
03:10:45.349 --> 03:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:49.429 --> 03:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh figured that out there are four new
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
bills in the committee I'm probably
 
03:10:54.590 --> 03:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
going to have a public hearing on each
 
03:11:00.389 --> 03:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:05.389 --> 03:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
um and then possibly a uh work session
 
03:11:07.710 --> 03:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
following those four but right right now
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
I'm uh you'll you'll know um or I can
 
03:11:14.110 --> 03:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
send out an email um later today or
 
03:11:16.510 --> 03:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow as to what the schedule is
 
03:11:19.150 --> 03:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
going to be but right now Tuesday and
 
03:11:20.750 --> 03:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
Wednesday are still possibilities next
 
03:11:23.670 --> 03:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
week the following week there'll be no
 
03:11:25.070 --> 03:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
there'll be
 
03:11:27.150 --> 03:11:27.160 align:start position:0%
nothing all right I think that does it
 
03:11:30.070 --> 03:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
for today excuse me Mr chairman yeah
 
03:11:33.229 --> 03:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
will you be executing bills next
 
03:11:33.239 --> 03:11:34.750 align:start position:0%
will you be executing bills next
week

03:11:34.750 --> 03:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
week
