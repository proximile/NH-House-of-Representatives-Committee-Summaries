good morning

good morning
everyone

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
welcome to Jael car let's see the um
 
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
seing of
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
alternates here
 
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
Jackie and so um representative grassy
 
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
you should sit in for representative
 
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
Schmidt and that to

quorum
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
so the minutes of the previous
 
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
meeting move to adopt as written and
 
00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 align:start position:0%

card that that way we won't have to
 
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
agenda okay in that case Madam chair I
 
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
move to consent agender as presented
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
second second by representative Lynn any
 
00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
discussion those in favor I I
 
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
agenda uh so the first item on the
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
regular agenda is 2023 97 from the real
 
00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:13.479 align:start position:0%
estate appraiser board uh this
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
particular proposal does have a number
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
of issues um the board has been
 
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:21.879 align:start position:0%
communicating with our office about
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
addressing these issues but
 
00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we've not been able to
 
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:28.039 align:start position:0%
resolve all of them um the first being
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
that there are some sections of this
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
proposal that have been expired since
 
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
February of
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
2023 um so the committee may have
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
questions of whether the board has been
 
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
enforcing the rules uh in violation of
 
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.550 align:start position:0%
enforcing the rules uh in violation of
541

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
541
 
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
a22 there's also an unclear comment on
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
page one of the rule text um the rule
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
cites to the fee in the federal statute
 
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
but the federal statute says that the
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
required fee being no more than $40 it
 
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
does not specify that it is $40 so that
 
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.640 align:start position:0%
is a little unclear of whether or not
 
00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
the board is actually charging $40 or
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
something less than
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
that also on page one the rule states
 
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
that an application will not be accepted
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
if it's not accompanied by the payment
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
of the application fee but it's unclear
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
whether the board is referring to just
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
the application fee in the PLC rule or
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
if that also incl includes that
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
federally required registration
 
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
fee ALS on page one there's another
 
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
301.8c as
 
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.829 align:start position:0%
301.8c as
written

00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
um again on page one and again on page
 
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
15 there's an unclear because of the way
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
the rule is written we've been seeing
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
this a lot lately where it's written as
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
an indirect requirement meaning that
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
when you read it it's as though the
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
application has to provide information
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
and not the applicant has to provide
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
information so that has to be Rewritten
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
to clearly State it's the applicant's
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to provide that
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
information uh also on page one there's
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
an unclear uh because there's a
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
discrepancy between the rule text and
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
the form that was submitted the form has
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
required re Ms that are not in the rule
 
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
text um on page three and once again on
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
page 15 uh there's an unclear because
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
there's a form that's titled experience
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
log um
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
but the requirements on that form are
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
not in the rule text so once again we
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
have a discrepancy there on page four
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
there's another unclear which also
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
appears on page five once again just not
 
00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
being clear as written the rule text
 
00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:03.639 align:start position:0%
uses the word information but really it
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
should be referring to the
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
application on page four uh this one
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
might need a legislative fix so there's
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
a legislative intent Authority unclear
 
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
comment because the board is requiring
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
appraisal management companies to
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
stipulate and agree that um whether it's
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire Court or New Hampshire
 
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
agency service may be made on the
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
executive director of
 
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
oplc but the statute itself says that
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
the service of process may be made on
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
the secretary of
 
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
state so there seems to be a discrepancy
 
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
on that as the statute seems pretty
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
clear but logistically wise it sounds as
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
though having it served on the executive
 
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
director may be the better option so
 
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
that would need a legislative fix if if
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's going to continue moving forward
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
um I have uh quite a few more comments
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
that I can continue going through or I
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
think might be U this may be enough for
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
us to deal with it one time
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
okay um yeah so so at this point because
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
of the number of issues um I would just
 
00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:19.519 align:start position:0%
recommend the committee consider a
 
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.160 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection at this point so
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
that the board can address it in a
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection response and um
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
like I said the expiration in this
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
legislative intent comment um would be
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be addressed
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
outside of that what's it you want to
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
move immediately to
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
that let's from hear from the agency on
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
the on the the fee question and the
 
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
legislative intents
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
question at least good morning Tina
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
Kelly office of professional lure and
 
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
certification I'm the rules coordinator
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
and on the fees we're simply what what I
 
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
found out was we it is in oplc fee
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
structure already so we're simply going
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
to point there for
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
that and it is probably $40 exactly I
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
believe that's what it is that's okay
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
and on the second one the legislative
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
attent intent I talked to um plc's
 
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
Council and it does make more sense to
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
have it um have it delivered to the
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
executive director dor rather than the
 
00:13:31.629 --> 00:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office because the
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office is just
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
going to send it to us and um it's on a
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
list for um future
 
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
legislative um correction okay and about
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
rules that I
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
um don't have the answer to that yet
 
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
because I was going to address
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
everything at once these are all things
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
that we can fix and we can we need to do
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
more research on um
 
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
on that but I can bring it back if if
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
you were to do a preliminary objection I
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
could bring it back and that
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
information I just have one question yes
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
so again it's about the legislative
 
00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:13.759 align:start position:0%
intent language as long as the law says
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State shouldn't the rules
 
00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:16.839 align:start position:0%
say Secretary of State even though you
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
might it makes more sense to go to the
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
executive director but my understanding
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
from the conversation is the the
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
language in the exact law says Secretary
 
00:14:25.839 --> 00:14:28.030 align:start position:0%
language in the exact law says Secretary
of

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
State Madam chair members of the
 
00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
committee Lindsay Courtney executive
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
director oplc I would agree with that
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
cerling I think the challenge is the
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
real estate appraisers board used to be
 
00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:38.959 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State so I think this falls
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
in the bucket of the cleanup language I
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
think if you if you get behind the plain
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
language which there's a question of
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
whether we could I think the intent is
 
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
to have the executive director or the
 
00:14:55.189 --> 00:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
executive off official be the
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
responsible party for service of process
 
00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
which used to be the secretary State and
 
00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
is now the office um I can't recall
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
whether it's it's slated in that cleanup
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
language that we've been working on this
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
session and we can certainly um look
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
into that um when we come back but I
 
00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
think that is kind of how we got here
 
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
which is which is they used to be
 
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
secretary more concerned about the fact
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
that someone May challenge improper
 
00:15:23.749 --> 00:15:23.759 align:start position:0%
service because the law says where it's
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
supposed to go and it wasn't done that
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
way if we put it in the rule and then we
 
00:15:28.309 --> 00:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
might lose something because we did
 
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
something directly
 
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
I think that we will make a note of that
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
and have them respond to the objection
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
response and we and if the statute is
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
not slated for immediate cleanup and I
 
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
know there's a bunch of them we've got
 
00:15:47.949 --> 00:15:47.959 align:start position:0%
them in my committee we will change
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
expect the rule to be changed back to
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
secretary of state would that agree that
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
makes sense yes okay representa L you
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
know I just have a question I the I
 
00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:00.519 align:start position:0%
mean with regard to the Secretary of
 
00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
State I'm I'm just curious is there I
 
00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:05.959 align:start position:0%
wonder if it might make sense to leave
 
00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759 align:start position:0%
it as Secretary of State just because do
 
00:16:12.189 --> 00:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
we know you know like what other where
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
where you have other situations of an
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
out of state licy um for other agencies
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
or whatever do you do we know whether
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
that says the Secretary of State or not
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
and number one and number two would it
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
make sense to just have for everybody
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's designating somebody to be their
 
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
agent their out of state
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
just have one person the Secretary of
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
State be that person thank you
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative Lyn I think that's a
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
fantastic question and one that we've
 
00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:41.319 align:start position:0%
been grappling with because as you know
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
if you have an um an entity a
 
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
corporation already registered with the
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State obviously um there
 
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
are ways uh to to affect service of
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
process by registering your business
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
with a secretary of state that said
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
there are a number of boards in our
 
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
technical professions that do have the
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
statutory language that require um in
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
particular businesses that are
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
registered or licensed by the office to
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
also designate the executive director um
 
00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:11.799 align:start position:0%
as the person to receive for service of
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
process I don't know from a policy
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
standpoint whether that makes sense for
 
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
the reasons you mention it may make
 
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:19.959 align:start position:0%
sense for an individual license but
 
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.039 align:start position:0%
certainly not sure if it makes sense
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
from from an entity who's already
 
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
registered to do business with the
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and there's already
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
that um duplicative process so that's
 
00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
something we can certainly um consider
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
and put into the board's
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
response thank you other
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
questions all right um we have we
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
covered all the
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
points uh the remaining comments that I
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
have are pretty much all unclear
 
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
comments whether it's discrepancies
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
between the rule text in the forms or
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
unclear as written or unclear citations
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
which all could be easily addressed in a
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection response okay does
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
someone wish to make make a preliminary
 
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
objection second okay move by
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt seconded by
 
00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:09.870 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt seconded by
Senator

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
discussion all right those in favor I I
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you we will
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
expect a response at your at the
 
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.710 align:start position:0%
expect a response at your at the
appropriate

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
time and specifically what you've been
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
doing with the expire
 
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.149 align:start position:0%
doing with the expire
rules

00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
rules
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
right natural
 
00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
scientists hey um so uh this is for soil
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
300 they contain the certification
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
requirements and the rules set up
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
application requirements and other
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
requirements for the certification of
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
soil and Wetland scientist the board has
 
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
filed an amended conditional approval um
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
which is online you should be able to
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
pull that up um and I'll be referring to
 
00:18:59.070 --> 00:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
that for the few issues that remain um a
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
couple of minor issues is that on page
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
19 of the uh PDF there the there's a web
 
00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
link um one of the last uh ones in the
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
appendex doesn't work and that is easily
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
fixable today um it can be addressed
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
orally then on the bottom of the first
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
page you'll see an informational note
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
just informing the committee that this
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
board still has some fee Authority in
 
00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
its statute but um since there's a lot
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
of cleanup going on this session might
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
already be aware of that finally there's
 
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
an issue um around the collection of
 
00:19:37.149 --> 00:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
fees during the time period of the rules
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
expiration in violation of 541a 22's
 
00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:43.720 align:start position:0%
prohibition on the enforcement of an
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
expired rule for any purpose and um
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll see that um on page I
 
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
believe it's a little further down uh
 
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.310 align:start position:0%
believe it's a little further down uh
soil

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
soil
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
31.03 it had the application fees and
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
like I said these rules expired in March
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
um 11th 2019 uh the rules now site to
 
00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
the new fees that are in the PLC
 
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
10002s and uh those are effective as of
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
August 1st of last year so there's this
 
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:17.559 align:start position:0%
gap of unenforceability of the
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
application fees between those two dates
 
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
um the committee has encountered the
 
00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:24.039 align:start position:0%
situation before with some of the other
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
boards in recent years and has at times
 
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
requested reports and on the number of
 
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
um impacted lies and whether or not
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
refunds have been made um that sort of
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
thing um as an example of you know doing
 
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
that as part of the conditional approval
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
um but that's up to the committee's
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
discretion um Ria medley is here today
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
she is general counsel for the boards
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
and um I thought she was going to be
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
speaking I don't see her now but Lindsay
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
Courtney is also here as well but um
 
00:20:56.909 --> 00:20:56.919 align:start position:0%
those are the only issues that remain
 
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair members of
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
the committee Lindy Courtney executive
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
director oplc I'm going to address the
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
fee issue and then I'll defer to
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
attorney medley to address any other
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
issues with respect to the board's rules
 
00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:18.919 align:start position:0%
so um and I think my statements probably
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
apply to the next uh uh rules package uh
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
with respect to Engineers so upon
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
learning of potential issues and
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
enforcing expired fee rules I did um I
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
did look into the matter to determine
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
root cause it appears that there were
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
errors in reading the source notes um
 
00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:39.559 align:start position:0%
and so that there was it it was not
 
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
clear immediately apparent that there
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
were expired fee rules which resulted in
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
um us continuing to assess fees at lure
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
and um initial lure and renewal we have
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
since um instituted uh remedies to
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
address this issue um which basically
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
stem from a lack of internal controls
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
which I think the committee is aware of
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
that we've been working on since 2019 at
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
least I've been working on since 2019 um
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
so a couple of things that we've done is
 
00:22:11.789 --> 00:22:11.799 align:start position:0%
first PLC 10002s we established those
 
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
back in August once the office did
 
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
receive or it was clear that the office
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
had statutory authority to to adopt
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
rules regarding fees so I think that
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
moving forward um we should see that
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
that with respect to fees those issues
 
00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
have been solved but as to the internal
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
controls issues regarding expiration of
 
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
rules what we've also done is we have a
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
policy and procedure now um setting for
 
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
the specific time frame in which uh
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
rules need to be um reviewed uh notified
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
the relevant parties need to be notified
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
we have a monthly rul making committee
 
00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:50.279 align:start position:0%
that we review um potential expiring
 
00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
rules we notify the boards we review
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
rulem committee requests um for
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
additional Ru making support and then
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
separately we've Pur just some software
 
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
that will essentially take the human out
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
of the analysis in terms of when rules
 
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
expire we should go live on that next
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
month um and so I think that going
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
forward we won't see hopefully um we
 
00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:15.559 align:start position:0%
won't see any issues with respects to
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
expired rules uh at least as it relates
 
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:20.360 align:start position:0%
to fees and you know the board could
 
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
choose to allow a rule to expire
 
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
purposely so in terms of refunds I think
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
the committee is probably aware that
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
um historically we have issued refunds
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
in the past if we have um improperly
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
assess a fee without based on a rule
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
that was expired I've gone back and I've
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
taken a look we've definitely done
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
refunds on Pharmacy we've done refunds
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
most recently when we did the emergency
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
rule for coas and Engineers but I don't
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
think we've ever gone back into a prior
 
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and certainly never gone
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
back into a
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
penum and I think that
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
that we need we need to do the right
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
thing and speaking with doj I'm not sure
 
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
that taking money from today's licenses
 
00:24:11.789 --> 00:24:11.799 align:start position:0%
and refunding it to lenses from 2019
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
2020 who received the benefit of the
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
bargain is necessarily the right thing
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
to do um so their advice is to you know
 
00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:21.559 align:start position:0%
to the extent that we need to do refunds
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
we could do refunds from July 1 of this
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to August one when we didn't
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
have rules in place this F school year
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
um but to not go back into a prior by
 
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.350 align:start position:0%
um but to not go back into a prior by
any

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
own happy to take any
 
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
questions representa yes and I guess I
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
have a because this has come up with me
 
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
um in previous uh discussions when we've
 
00:24:48.029 --> 00:24:48.039 align:start position:0%
collected money for something let's say
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
a license but somebody gets the license
 
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
and yes the rule has expired but then if
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
we give back the the money do they do we
 
00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
not retrieve back the license because it
 
00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
is a so I think that director Courtney
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
has a point and if somebody gets that
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
service even though the rule has
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
expired I can understand the difficulty
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
in having the rule expire and not
 
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
carrying out the rule and therefore if
 
00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
we do that then that benefit should be
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
removed as well that's I think that in
 
00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:23.799 align:start position:0%
all fairness that's what people pay the
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
license or the application fee
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
for and of of course the a license
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
granted in 2019 would have expired in
 
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
2021 so just want to reiterate that we
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
take this issue very seriously I was
 
00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
dreading coming here to talk to you
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
today as much as I love appearing before
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
legislative committees because this
 
00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
should never happen ever um and I think
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
we've done what we need to do to
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
Institute internal controls but we're
 
00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
still cleaning up um we're still
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
cleaning up issues that have long that
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
time Senator I I just have one question
 
00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:06.919 align:start position:0%
on page 14 where you have that section
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
two at the top of the page that actually
 
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
says $200 fee but then it also refers to
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
the fee schedule I'm a little just
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
nervous that they might get out of sync
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
and whether it makes sense to strike the
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
$200 and just say upon payment of fee as
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
described in the fee schedule and Le
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
strike the $200 so we don't have an
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
issue where potentially we get two rules
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
out of
 
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.470 align:start position:0%
out of
sync

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
sync
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
whether that would be an acceptable edit
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
so page 14 on a Revis conditional
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
approval uh
 
00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
two yes I completely agree with that we
 
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
should not we should be referring to the
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
PLC 10002s because that's how we'll get
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
into issues moving forward we can make
 
00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:54.230 align:start position:0%
into issues moving forward we can make
that

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
change anyone
 
00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.510 align:start position:0%
change anyone
else

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
well we already
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
um this is already a revised conditional
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
approval request final approval with the
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
requested chair It's actually an amended
 
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
conditional approval um but yes they can
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
make these changes orally they can agree
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
to these today and um like I said at the
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
outset that web link on page 19 doesn't
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
work and so that can be part of the
 
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
conditional approval today okay so
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
Senator uh langing moves conditional
 
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
approval of the amended conditional
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
approval request with those two addition
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
extra changes is that correct okay is
 
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
be director Courtney you you said you
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
have a new software package to keep
 
00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:03.799 align:start position:0%
track of your rules is that in sync with
 
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:06.039 align:start position:0%
the new software package the
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
administrative rules department is
 
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
working on and and hoping to uh
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
generally provide that data so um it it
 
00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
certainly it's not something we've
 
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.039 align:start position:0%
talked about interfacing it currently
 
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
our software is already used by the
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
Department of Education at my
 
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%
understanding is it basically captures
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
information that's on the j court
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
website basically trolls that
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
information and puts it into the system
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
um which we use for tracking and
 
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
internal reporting and it also contains
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
templates that are the templates um that
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
are contained in the draft manual to
 
00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that we limit um any errors in
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
drafting but I'm certainly happy to talk
 
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
to attorney moral about it you know to
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're we're not thank you
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
that would that would help but we don't
 
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
need more incompatible software systems
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
I agreed our our updates are actually
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
being all done in house with our own it
 
00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:02.919 align:start position:0%
people so we're not uh Contracting
 
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
software out but eventually it will have
 
00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:07.519 align:start position:0%
those those
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
capabilities all right thank you any
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
other we have a motion for a conditional
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
approval is that any further discussion
 
00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
I think we the C we've had is good okay
 
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
those in favor I
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you very
 
00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:29.669 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you very
much

00:29:29.669 --> 00:29:29.679 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
okay so the next one uh 2023 167
 
00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
engineering 300 um these rules set up
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
application and other requirements for
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
the licensing of Engineers um the board
 
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
has filed um late filed an amended
 
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request and the
 
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
committee will need to vote to accept
 
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
that late filed item since there wasn't
 
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
a waiver with that um we could do that
 
00:29:54.509 --> 00:29:54.519 align:start position:0%
now or we can do that towards the end um
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
let's let's vote on whether to accept it
 
00:29:59.310 --> 00:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
so we know what we're talking talking
 
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
about so I move that we accept the late
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
filed conditional approval request
 
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
second discussion those in favor I I
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
opposed we will deal with that there are
 
00:30:16.269 --> 00:30:16.279 align:start position:0%
um just a few issues that remain with
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
the proposal and I'll just take the
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
minor ones first um on page one of the
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval packet
 
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:25.640 align:start position:0%
there's an informational note um again
 
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
that this board still has some fee
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
Authority and it stat
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
but that's probably going to be fixed
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
during the session's cleanup next on
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
page eight there's a comment um that was
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
made the last time the rules went
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
through and that was back in
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
2013 and um that's that there might be
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
some need to clarify in the statute that
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
the third-party testing company develops
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
the exam rather than having that Duty be
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
on the board um it kind kind of comes
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
down to an issue of how to interpret
 
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
that that statute's language but like
 
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:00.200 align:start position:0%
said this issue was raised before and
 
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
the rules were approved despite the
 
00:31:05.549 --> 00:31:05.559 align:start position:0%
concern um the final issue is is I'd
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
like to comment on that of course the
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
professional engineer testing is
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
standardized Nationwide and we certainly
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
don't want our board creating its own
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
test so I and I'm pretty sure that would
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
have been the uh intent of the
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
legislature because it's been that way
 
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
at least in at least for 50 years so so
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
I I think we can be fairly confident the
 
00:31:32.909 --> 00:31:32.919 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is to use the
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
exam director morl um historically this
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
has been an issue where statutes were
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
fairly old regarding any given board it
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
often required them to create an exam
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
over time though uh National exams came
 
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
about everybody they're standardized
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
everybody wanted to use them I know a
 
00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
number of agencies have over the years
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
uh used corrective legislation uh to do
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
that but this one I think is a closer
 
00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:11.039 align:start position:0%
call and I understand your point
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
too so
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
um fine we'll add it to the list of
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
things that could be cleaned
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
up okayy um the final issue to discuss
 
00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
is around um the collection of fees
 
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
during the time period of the rules
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
expiration just like the last proposal
 
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
if you look at page 13 of the amended
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
conditional approval packet you'll see a
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
um and that rule was effective last
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
August so there's that Gap again between
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
um January 1st of 2020 and then August
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
1st of 2023 in which there were no fee
 
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
rules on the next page of that packet on
 
00:33:15.629 --> 00:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
page 14 you'll see a copy of a standing
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
order that the board issued citing the
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
expired rules at the time the board that
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
issu at the time the board issued the
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
standing order only those two paragraphs
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
were effective and that was the fee for
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
certification as a traine and the fee
 
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
for um examinations but the standing
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
order is really about uh bounce checks
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
um so it's kind of been a roundabout way
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
I guess you could say enforcing um this
 
00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
the rules it makes it clear that um that
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know bouncing a check or not paying
 
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
for it is a um a disciplinary violation
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
so U presumably the board was collecting
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
fees on the expired rule but um just
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
like you heard on the last proposal um
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
there have been a lot of um things
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
implemented to try to prevent this from
 
00:34:06.269 --> 00:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
happening again but um these were the
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
proposal thank you again Lindsay
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
Courtney executive director oplc so my
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
comments with respect to the fees are
 
00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
the same with respect to uh soil
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
scientists I don't believe we've the
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
board has ever disciplined anybody on a
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
returned check that's not an issue we
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
have with the board of Engineers there
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
are other boards where that's an issue
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
but um I I don't think that's an issue
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
with them and I don't think they've ever
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
discipline what about all the other fees
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
that are listed there including the a
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
licensure as a professional
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
engineer so again I think yet those
 
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
certainly were collected um going back
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
to 2020 my comments are essentially the
 
00:34:56.109 --> 00:34:56.119 align:start position:0%
same it was an error in reading the
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
source notes I think at Point um years
 
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
ago the rules were valid only for 8
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
years and some were and then they we
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
switched to 10 years and certain
 
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
portions of the rule were on the 10-year
 
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:09.400 align:start position:0%
track and so it wasn't clear um it
 
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't immediately parent to somebody
 
00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
who's who's not um used to wrting Source
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
expired any other comments questions
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
represented or L well again I'm looking
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
at the 3024 a list of all those fees and
 
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
license fees is that is that expired and
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
not being implemented because it's in
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
PLC one2 whatever it
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
is on page 13 a list of all those fees
 
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
are now going to is that going in the
 
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
rule I'm trying to understand what those
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
and we're not it doesn't look like it is
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
that section essentially being deleted
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
with a reference to uh is that that's
 
00:35:55.069 --> 00:35:55.079 align:start position:0%
correct trying to
 
00:35:55.079 --> 00:35:56.630 align:start position:0%
correct trying to
understand

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.630 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
appr Senor line moves to approve is
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
there a
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
second yes by representative Schmidt any
 
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.750 align:start position:0%
second yes by representative Schmidt any
further

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
concerns seeing n the representative
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
Schmid so it it does seem that you are
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
working out uh some kind of a some kind
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
of a process here but uh it it seems a
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
little bit U kind of like oral R making
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
almost uh which we don't like uh so I'm
 
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
wondering is there some alternative to
 
00:36:50.589 --> 00:36:50.599 align:start position:0%
just kind of like making do
 
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
uh would be better clearer and so forth
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
so I think there are really two options
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
here I think their fees were improperly
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
collected which we acknowledge the
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
question is whether or not we should be
 
00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
essentially refunding those fees and or
 
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
asking for the licenses back for the
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
work that they've they've done um I
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the best
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
solution um and again this obviously
 
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
should not happen but I I think moving
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
forward we need to have a solution in
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
place which we do but I'm not sure that
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
really completely rectify the issue in
 
00:37:31.359 --> 00:37:32.990 align:start position:0%
really completely rectify the issue in
the

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
sorry uh I'm more concerned with the you
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
know putting out a standing order than
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that the fees were
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
collected carrying on but um putting out
 
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
a standing order saying we've got the
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
authority to assess
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
fees and um
 
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
and essentially saying proceed against
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
someone who who puts out a uh a bad
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
check yeah I think we asked all of our
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
boards to do a standing order and we
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
gave them the templated language because
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
particularly with certain boards there
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
were issues many issues with return
 
00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
checks and as you may know when there's
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
a return check the fee that the state
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
incurs the fee on that um again I don't
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
think and I can confirm but I don't
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
think Engineers were ever discipl with
 
00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
respect to this issue and I think uh
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
this goes back to it wasn't immediately
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
imper to the board and to the person
 
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:37.960 align:start position:0%
assisting them with the standing order
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
that the rules were actually expired at
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
at the time um that the standing order
 
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.790 align:start position:0%
at the time um that the standing order
was

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
issued I see thank you well I'm I'm more
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
concerned about rectifying the situation
 
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
we can't go back and undo the past
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
obviously and we're kind of uh you know
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
Rolling Along on flat tires but uh is
 
00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:05.079 align:start position:0%
there a better procedure um or or
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
something that is at least better for
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
the F for ongoing I'm not so concerned
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
about undoing the pa okay I think that
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
the solution really was ensuring that
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
oplc has the authority to set fees so
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
that we're not going into 50s something
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
different rule sets to pull out the fees
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
in multiple different locations so we've
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
we've you've accomplished that we've
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
accomplished that we have some fees in
 
00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
place and we are statutorily required to
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
do an assessment and a review
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
periodically we're undertaking that now
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
we likely will be proposing some
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
additional fee adjustments which will
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
result in additional filing which will
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
result in an additional 10 years and so
 
00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
I don't see this issue uh happening
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
again because all of the fees have been
 
00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
Consolidated in the 102s okay as long as
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
we're proceeding on an orderly basis
 
00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
from here on in more comfortable with
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
questions all right those in favor
 
00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.790 align:start position:0%
questions all right those in favor
I

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:40:08.109 --> 00:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
oppos all right thank you very much and
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
we're looking forward to that report
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
right safety okay so um 174 uh
 
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
registration hearings so you'll see that
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
um that there's a legislative intent
 
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
comment on this one around um the last
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
section um let me see here on the final
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
proposal that would be page three or
 
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
actually page seven of the FP packet
 
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:43.640 align:start position:0%
however that comment is actually
 
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
resolved because this was something that
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
I missed that that rule has been
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
extended by 541
 
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
A14 and uh it's kind of funny because
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
I've caught this a lot lately on other
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
proposals but completely missed this one
 
00:40:59.230 --> 00:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
so those rules have been extended
 
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:01.599 align:start position:0%
because they were filed prior to their
 
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
expiration back in August so um I have
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
no other issues with this
 
00:41:07.079 --> 00:41:08.870 align:start position:0%
no other issues with this
proposal

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
excellent any
 
00:41:14.829 --> 00:41:14.839 align:start position:0%
questions motion move to approve second
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
second by Senator Enis move by rep
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
Senator L any
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
discussion those in favor I
 
00:41:26.589 --> 00:41:26.599 align:start position:0%
opposed all right thank you uh the next
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
two are not not ready and we'd like to
 
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
postpone them to the April meeting so
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
moved Madame chair uh before you vote on
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
that 184 will'll need a waiver for jail
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
car because our April meeting isn't
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
until the 19th and our deadline was the
 
00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:45.079 align:start position:0%
15th so we'll also just need a vote on
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
that I'll add the waiver in my motion
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
yes we will request to postpone the two
 
00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
184 all
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
right already been seconded I believe
 
00:42:03.309 --> 00:42:03.319 align:start position:0%
okay all right discussion those in favor
 
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
I opposed right we will see you next
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
accountancy so this one actually just
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
needs an oral conditional approval
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
because the issues are that it states
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
Board of septic system evaluators
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
instead of board of county in um AC
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
20.01 um and the other issue was that it
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
mentions uh petitions for waiver of rule
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
which is the very next section so that
 
00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:44.839 align:start position:0%
could be deleted but those are the only
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
two issues and if the board is willing
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
to take a oral conditional approval we
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
that it looks as though the this rule
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
essentially is
 
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
repealing vast quantities of of rule is
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
that correct yes it repeals all the AC
 
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
rule 200 rules and um sites to the PLC
 
00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.829 align:start position:0%
rule 200 rules and um sites to the PLC
200

00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
200
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
rules it's um like many of the boards
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
are consolidating to to site to a PLC
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
all right I see your
 
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:21.160 align:start position:0%
point we have the conditionally approved
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
according discussion anything important
 
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
to add nothing at this time all
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
right and
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
um just questions comments those in
 
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.390 align:start position:0%
um just questions comments those in
favor

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
favor
 
00:43:50.109 --> 00:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
much Madam chair yes um I missed who the
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
second was on
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.309 --> 00:44:03.319 align:start position:0%
okay oh sorry and we missed postponing
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
the lure and disciplinary
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
sections correct um this next one uh
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
2023 276 needs to be postponed and no
 
00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
waiver is needed for it move the
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
postpone and Grant waiver no waiver you
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
said no waiver was needed all right so
 
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
move the postpone
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
second okay seconded by by
 
00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.069 align:start position:0%
second okay seconded by by
representative

00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
ly all right those in favor I opposed
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
um the only issue is that the rules
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
State a fee that is not delineated in
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
PLC 10002 and there doesn't appear to be
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
roeming at this point um to add that Fe
 
00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
to 10002 so it's it's a little bit of a
 
00:45:03.549 --> 00:45:03.559 align:start position:0%
difficult situation because
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
the the board the Board needs to site
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
to be in PLC 1000002 but it's not in
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
10002 and that's the OPC that needs to
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
fix that um so it's kind of like a
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
situation where this rule isn't really
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
where it needs to be fixed is this if I
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
is this the the comment on page three uh
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
it's on page seven seven okay because on
 
00:45:32.549 --> 00:45:32.559 align:start position:0%
page three it specifically says that if
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the in PLC a00 and
 
00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
two no
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
feet I think is a nice general
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
it's well same thing there they say if
 
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:47.960 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:50.559 align:start position:0%
fee listed in the other rule we won't
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
charge it so C2 kind of covers it but if
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's not in there until we add it
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
there's no fee for this like that's
 
00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.230 align:start position:0%
there's no fee for this like that's
correct

00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:00.069 align:start position:0%
correct
I'm

00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
okay perfectly okay with that myself all
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
right any other comments concerns motion
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
move to approve second moved by Senator
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
Lynn any
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
discussion those in favor
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
I those oppos i' I'd like to comment
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
that there's a very very nice
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh statement of responses to comments
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
that is included in this packet and I'm
 
00:46:43.349 --> 00:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
else exper revision
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
to okay so this is the expedited
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
revision to forums
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
20242 it's uh Bureau of credentialing
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
for educator fors and there are actually
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
20 forms in this um this proposal and
 
00:47:08.549 --> 00:47:08.559 align:start position:0%
there are a handful that have some
 
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
issues uh for example there's a title
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
that is different on in the worldle text
 
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
in the form there are three that uh that
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
refer to the um school year 20123 2024
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
which means the the it would need to be
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
editorial changed every year um and
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
there's uh a couple that have
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
requirements uh that are not in the rule
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
and a certification that is not in the
 
00:47:42.270 --> 00:47:42.280 align:start position:0%
rule so uh our after discussing with the
 
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
agency we' discuss getting a preliminary
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
objection just because unfortunately in
 
00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
this this process at the moment we don't
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
have a CA uh conditional approval
 
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
process um so you have to do a
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
preliminary objection to get those those
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
revisions done um and so I think that's
 
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
what we had talked about before um that
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
that process is coming in legislation
 
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
but it's just not here yet
 
00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
comments administrative rules
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%

credentialing Department of
 
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
Ed so how do you feel about the uh the
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
suggested procedure
 
00:48:32.589 --> 00:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
um so the first um suggestion that was
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
um put to us was the um on doe boc2 the
 
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
application for ler um we'd be happy to
 
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
change the rule to reflect the um
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the name change on the
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
form on doe sorry sorry I like the
 
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
question is I think we all agree we we
 
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
know what the issues are I think the
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
question is are you okay with the
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
process that we preliminary object to
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
give you to make the corrections
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
necessary and then bring it back so we
 
00:49:03.069 --> 00:49:03.079 align:start position:0%
can approve it yes that's fine so sorry
 
00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
okay s the line move to preliminary
 
00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:07.559 align:start position:0%
object that
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
good move by Senator L second by
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt any
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
discussion all right those in favor I I
 
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
much really
 
00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:28.549 align:start position:0%
much really
rolling

00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
rolling
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
we do not yet have the watercraft safety
 
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
rules that's correct um and it's not due
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
till April 1st so that one's still
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.990 align:start position:0%
 
rule

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
okay with the chair's permission uh I
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
think it would be good to have the
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
agency go first to
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
explain U why they're doing the
 
00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:04.710 align:start position:0%
explain U why they're doing the
emergency

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
role good morning I didn't know I was
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
the agency good morning I'm Helen Hanks
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
I'm the commissioner of the Department
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
of Corrections but I am a member of the
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
opioid batement commission uh and the
 
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
commission at the last meeting asked if
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
a member could come and join our
 
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.160 align:start position:0%
stewards from HHS to talk about the
 
00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.230 align:start position:0%
stewards from HHS to talk about the
emergency

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
rule uh the emergency rule is before you
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
because the commission has really found
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
after its uh lengthy work uh since
 
00:50:34.829 --> 00:50:34.839 align:start position:0%
implementation of the trust fund that we
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
need to make some adjustments as a state
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh to recognize that both locally at the
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
county level and even at the state level
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
there are opportunities to be more
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
Nimble to get the opioid trust fund
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
dollars out swiftly um to uh Abate the
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
effect of opioids in our communities and
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
that's what this rule is attempting uh
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
to do I can get into some specific
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
specific details um if the committee has
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
questions glad to see that you're
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
intending to enter into into regular rul
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
making to uh confirm
 
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
this any other comments um I am not
 
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
prepared to argue that uh they there is
 
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
no basis for emergency rule I I think
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
arguably there is a basis um however the
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
rule itself and the uh cover sheet for
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
the Emergency Rule raise a number of
 
00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.750 align:start position:0%
the Emergency Rule raise a number of
questions

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
um I can uh I can give those to the
 
00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
department and I think for the most part
 
00:51:46.829 --> 00:51:46.839 align:start position:0%
they can be uh addressed during the
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
regular rulemaking process which will be
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
necessary okay excellent that that is
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
where that sort of
 
00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
uh concern would should be addressed
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
yeah there were a couple things though
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
um if you see on the first page of the
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
emergency rule in 03 F the definition of
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
eligible entity is being changed and it
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
seems to be taking out government
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
agencies but it's my understanding that
 
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the uh emergency rule is
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
to put in a couple of Emer uh a couple
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
of government agencies
 
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
so I wasn't sure why they're changing
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
the definition of eligible entity and
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
the other major concern I think is
 
00:52:41.069 --> 00:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
that um the current process for doing
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
this is in
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
10205 um which is not part of the
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
emergency Rule and that requires getting
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
an RFP and other steps um I think the
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
idea with the emergency rule is to do an
 
00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
abbreviated uh process for these uh uh
 
00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:01.710 align:start position:0%
abbreviated uh process for these uh uh
two

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:01.720 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
entities um however that means that
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to have two separate
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
processes in the rule uh which may make
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
a Clarity issue but perhaps they can
 
00:53:12.079 --> 00:53:13.829 align:start position:0%
a Clarity issue but perhaps they can
amend

00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
amend
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
10205 uh or the emergenc the language of
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
this you give us some information on
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
that good morning uh Alison radme I'm
 
00:53:32.789 --> 00:53:32.799 align:start position:0%
the administrator for the rules unit at
 
00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
Services um with respect to um the the
 
00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
comments that attorney moral had just
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
made um it has after reading this and it
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
being pointed out um that in the regular
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
rulemaking uh process uh we will be
 
00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.030 align:start position:0%
rulemaking uh process uh we will be
changing

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:53:53.069 --> 00:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
fback uh to read how it uh originally uh
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
States um and I apologize we don't have
 
00:53:59.789 --> 00:53:59.799 align:start position:0%
uh one 10205 in front of us uh to review
 
00:54:01.789 --> 00:54:01.799 align:start position:0%
and uh respond to that this time but
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
again any comments we receive will be
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
addressed in the regular Ru making
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
process um which we to begin uh quite
 
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
shortly would it be fair to say that the
 
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.630 align:start position:0%
shortly would it be fair to say that the
process

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:54:16.829 --> 00:54:16.839 align:start position:0%
1,205 is intended to be followed for for
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
grants hold on please
 
00:54:25.359 --> 00:54:27.510 align:start position:0%
grants hold on please
sorry

00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes I I I no the new
 
00:54:34.589 --> 00:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
entities would not follow the process in
 
00:54:38.829 --> 00:54:38.839 align:start position:0%
1025 uh the cabet explains that that uh
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
would take too long to get this
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
Implement uh the use of the funds by
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
these two entities so they're creating
 
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.589 align:start position:0%
these two entities so they're creating
this

00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:48.599 --> 00:54:50.109 align:start position:0%
this
exception

00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
exception
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
see so I think that you when you enter
 
00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
into regular rul making you should in
 
00:54:59.309 --> 00:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
fact include that section on the process
 
00:54:59.319 --> 00:55:00.549 align:start position:0%
fact include that section on the process
to

00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
indicate so that at least it's
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
rules any other comments
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions okay we don't have to do
 
00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
anything on emergency rules but uh we
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
will see what comes out of the regular
 
00:55:27.069 --> 00:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
rule thank you don't
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have to approve I'm sorry
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
moving I'm moving to the next item we
 
00:55:34.029 --> 00:55:34.039 align:start position:0%
don't we don't need a me a middle
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
meeting we don't need no no I think we
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
will by uh consensus cancel the uh
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
continued meeting and plan to meet at a
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.589 align:start position:0%
regular scheduled meeting on April
19th

00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
