contentious bill it's caused a lot of
 
00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:22.389 align:start position:0%
contentious bill it's caused a lot of
conversation

00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
conversation

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
about controversial issues and not being
 
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.550 align:start position:0%
about controversial issues and not being
afraid

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
afraid

understanding
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
of issues and you know this one deals
 
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.430 align:start position:0%
of issues and you know this one deals
with

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
the issues of racism and sexism
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
and you know we know that those are
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
morally reprehensible things we want to
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
get rid of those from our society as
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
much as possible and that's the
 
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.710 align:start position:0%
much as possible and that's the
trajectory

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
trajectory
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
that we've been on our as our state and
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
uh country are making progress on these
 
00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:56.230 align:start position:0%
uh country are making progress on these
things

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
um there's a a movement
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
it's called critical race theory i saw
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
in the agenda
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
my my section was uh critical race
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
theory ban so i just want to set the
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
record straight
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't ban critical race
 
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.949 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't ban critical race
theory

00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
theory
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't even bend talking about
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
some of the subject matters of critical
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
race theory
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
what it does is it prevents taxpayer
 
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:21.910 align:start position:0%
what it does is it prevents taxpayer
money

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
from advocating towards a certain view
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
so for instance if you're in a class
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
and they discuss some of the tenets of
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
critical race theory we get into that a
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
um that you wouldn't be you wouldn't
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
fail or pass based on your
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh stating your belief in that theory
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
so think about it this way if
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
creationism was taught about in school
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
you could discuss it as some people
 
00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:49.750 align:start position:0%
you could discuss it as some people
think

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
that this is the way the world works the
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
earth was created
 
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
seven days animals were created in this
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
order but you couldn't
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
the teacher couldn't pass or fail you
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
based on your stating that you believe
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
in creationism right we know that would
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
be wrong
 
00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
um and so that's that's what house bill
 
00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:07.110 align:start position:0%
um and so that's that's what house bill
544

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
544
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
does it takes some of the tenets of
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
critical race theory
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
it kind of just like brushes against the
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
edge of it
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
and some of the more controversial
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
positions that sometimes are used
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
to promote critical race theory and it
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
says we don't want to fund these with
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
um so i'll here's what i don't want to
 
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
do i don't want to box against
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
shadows of what people say the bill says
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
i want to
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
i want to talk about what the bill
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
actually says so
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
um have have most of you read it who has
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
read it and who hasn't read it
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
so who has read it okay everybody's read
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
so it's it can be a little confusing the
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
way that it's set up but
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
if you've read it you went over the the
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
definitions of divisive concepts
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
and um you know i guess i don't have to
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
read all those for you because you've
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
all you've all read those but
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
two of them that really stand out is and
 
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.389 align:start position:0%
two of them that really stand out is and
imagine

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh using taxpayer money to promote this
 
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.590 align:start position:0%
uh using taxpayer money to promote this
idea

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
that one race or sex is inherently
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
superior to another race or sex
 
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't want to use taxpayer money
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
to promote that idea
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
and another one that stands out an
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
individual should be discriminated
 
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.590 align:start position:0%
individual should be discriminated
against

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
or receive adverse treatment solely or
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
partly because of his or her race or sex
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
so we wouldn't want to discriminate
 
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
against people or teach people to
 
00:12:31.269 --> 00:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
discriminate against other people
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
based on their race or sex solely or
 
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.430 align:start position:0%
based on their race or sex solely or
partly

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
partly
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
um and then there's some other issues
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
here um
 
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
an individual's moral character we
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to teach using taxpayer
 
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.670 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to teach using taxpayer
money

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
that an individual's moral character is
 
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.790 align:start position:0%
that an individual's moral character is
necessarily

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
determined by his or her race or sex and
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
this gets into the fundamental idea of
 
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.550 align:start position:0%
this gets into the fundamental idea of
individual

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh rights so do you guys know the
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
difference between individualism
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
and collectivism that's kind of the
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
spectrum so like america
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
and uh maybe even eastern european
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
european traditions
 
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
well let's say let's just stick with
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
america because we kind of had to have a
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
revolution about this issue but
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
um we're focused on individual liberty
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't mean you're selfish it
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that all you care about is
 
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.190 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that all you care about is
yourself

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
what it means is that the individual is
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
supreme that
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
our beliefs our our thoughts our uh
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
conscience only emanates from within
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
each of us
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
as individuals um that the group is
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
secondary to the
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
individual and if you look at maybe like
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
communist china they kind of reverse
 
00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.069 align:start position:0%
communist china they kind of reverse
that

00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:40.629 --> 00:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
that the group that the individual has
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
to subordinate themselves to the group
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
and so um that's why we don't want to
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
judge people
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
based on attributes that they were born
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
with whether
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
they're born a certain sex or a certain
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
race we don't want to say
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
because you're part of this group
 
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
therefore we're going to ascribe
 
00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:03.519 align:start position:0%
these negative character traits to you
 
00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
that it's the individual's actions it's
 
00:14:06.639 --> 00:14:07.269 align:start position:0%
that it's the individual's actions it's
our

00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
our deeds as an individual that we
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
should be judged
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
on and um you know you've heard the
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
quote people say it a million times
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
it's uh martin luther king that we would
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
want a society that where we're judged
 
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
based on the content
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
of our character not the color of our
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
skin and so
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
um that's just kind of like a prelude
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
to what the bill is trying to address is
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
we're not going to use taxpayer money
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
and that's what the bill addresses it's
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
about spending
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh taxpayer funds uh to promote these
 
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.949 align:start position:0%
uh taxpayer funds uh to promote these
ideas

00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
even if it's called diversity training
 
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
so you can call something diversity
 
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:44.870 align:start position:0%
so you can call something diversity
training

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
and then you can kind of um you know
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
diversity training would be
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh diversity is something we strive for
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
inclusion is something we strive for
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
um but if if you
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
try to promote that one race or sex is
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
inherently good or bad based on
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
how someone was born then that would be
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
kind of a violation
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
of you know what america is about
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
so i'll just i'll just mention two
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
things so if you've read the bill
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
the requirements for the state i don't
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
know if you guys have this in front of
 
00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:21.110 align:start position:0%
know if you guys have this in front of
you

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
so the the main things are um one and
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
two there so i'm looking at page two
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
it's line
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
one if you have the pdf sorry line 11 if
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
you have the pdf version
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
and uh it says the state of new
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire shall not teach instruct or
 
00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:35.839 align:start position:0%
train any employee contractor staff
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
member student
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
or any other individual group and here's
 
00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:41.519 align:start position:0%
the key words to adopt or believe
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
so to adopt or believe is that's the key
 
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.829 align:start position:0%
so to adopt or believe is that's the key
word

00:15:45.829 --> 00:15:45.839 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
and sometimes opponents to the bill kind
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
of leave that they push that aside
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
they simply they overly simplify it uh
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
to say that you can't talk about
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
these things and that's not true you can
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
talk about them
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
as long as you're not passing or failing
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
someone for adopting or believing
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
in those things you see that difference
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
and then the second section there i'm
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
looking at line 14 on the pdf version
 
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
no employee contractor staff member
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
student of the state of new hampshire
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
shall face any penalty
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
or discrimination on account of his or
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
her refusal to support believe endorse
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
embrace confess
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
act upon or otherwise it's sent to the
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
divisive concept so
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
you can learn about the divisive
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
concepts but if someone says
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
you will fail this class if you don't
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
say you believe in them
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
or in one of them or you know then that
 
00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
would be against this bill that would be
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
discrimination against
 
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
your right to conscience so your your
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
right to believe what you want to
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
and then just a couple of things that
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
i'll point out um
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes people say oh this spans
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
diversity inclusion training
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
or even that abandons talking about the
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
holocaust or talking about women's
 
00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:53.509 align:start position:0%
holocaust or talking about women's
suffrage

00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
suffrage
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
so there's a tactic in politics where
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
you create a strong man argument against
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
your opponent so instead of talking
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
about what the bill really says
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
you make this imaginary version of
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
whatever you're fighting against
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
and then you project that out into the
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
public discourse and then
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
the people trying to support the other
 
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
side have
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
have trouble trying to say no that's not
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
what it says that's not what it says
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
um because it's you know it's out there
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's what the public uh
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
has been told to believe right and
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
that's why i want to stress
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
actually reading the language of the
 
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
bill because
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
um it's not what someone's imagination
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
of what the bill says that counts it's
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
what it actually says that's what
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
becomes law
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
so um page three
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
it's line 32 so people say this bans
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
diversity and inclusion trainings well
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
it says agency diversity and inclusion
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
efforts shall first and foremost
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
encourage agency employees not to judge
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
each other by their
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
color race ethnicity sex or any other
 
00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.830 align:start position:0%
color race ethnicity sex or any other
characteristic

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
characteristic
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
protected by federal or state law
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
so i think you know most people would
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
agree that that's what
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
diversity inclusion training should do
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
it should encourage agency employees not
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
and then finally it says you know the
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
opponents will say this will
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
prohibit talking about this in the
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
classroom well
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
my rebuttal to that would be again
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
language from the bill page 4
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
line 21 it says nothing in this chapter
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
shall be construed
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
to prohibit discussing as part of a
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
larger course of
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
academic descrip instruction the
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
divisive concepts listed
 
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
in an objective manner and without
 
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.350 align:start position:0%
in an objective manner and without
endorsement

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
endorsement
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
so i use that example with creationism
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
you know some people sincerely believe
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
that creationism
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
is how the world was made but we don't
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
use taxpayer money to
 
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
promote um that people need to
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
adopt and believe something that should
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
be left
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
to the you know our private thoughts and
 
00:18:59.919 --> 00:19:00.870 align:start position:0%
to the you know our private thoughts and
so

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
you know that's really the focus of the
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
bill now how much time do i have left
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
you haven't got i want to leave time for
 
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.029 align:start position:0%
you haven't got i want to leave time for
questions

00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
that would be great thank you but i
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
wanna i wanna just say one thing to you
 
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.110 align:start position:0%
wanna i wanna just say one thing to you
guys

00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
guys
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
um so this is part of a larger
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
discussion that's happening nationally
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
about um it's mainly about race but it's
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
about sexism too um
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
and you hear the term critical race
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
theory you put it in the agenda
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
and what what proponents of critical
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
race theory don't tell you
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
and i i want you to research this on
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
your own
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
is that critical race theory is part of
 
00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
a set of theories
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
called critical theories so there's
 
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.590 align:start position:0%
called critical theories so there's
critical

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
critical
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
you know legal theory there's different
 
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
critical theories
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
but it traces its roots back to uh
 
00:19:49.679 --> 00:19:52.310 align:start position:0%
but it traces its roots back to uh
marxism

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
marxism
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
traces its roots back to the frankfurt
 
00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.150 align:start position:0%
traces its roots back to the frankfurt
school

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
uh which was in germany in the 1930s
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
that it's it's part of that lineage of
 
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.110 align:start position:0%
that it's it's part of that lineage of
thought

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
and it's really to divide people
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
into do two different groups so like
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
classical marxism divided people into
 
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.270 align:start position:0%
classical marxism divided people into
the

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:14.149 --> 00:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
capital you know the the bourgeoisie and
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
the proletariat right the labor class
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
working class and the capital class
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
but this is using race to divide people
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a there's an underlying
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
agenda behind it is to gain political
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
power that's what
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
pretty much every um every advocacy
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
is about usually about gaining political
 
00:20:34.159 --> 00:20:35.110 align:start position:0%
is about usually about gaining political
power

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
so if you if you dig into critical race
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
theory and again 544 doesn't bend
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
talking about it
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
and all it does is say um these really
 
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200 align:start position:0%
really divisive uh fringe
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
ideas that some people who support
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
critical race their use
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't want to use taxpayer money
 
00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:53.750 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't want to use taxpayer money
and

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
train people or teach people that this
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
is the only way this is the only way to
 
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.310 align:start position:0%
is the only way this is the only way to
think

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
so you know it's part of the larger
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
discussion that's okay but asking you're
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
failing somebody on it
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
would be wrong this this has been really
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
helpful and it's been great to hear your
 
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.510 align:start position:0%
helpful and it's been great to hear your
opinion

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
and um rationale for introducing this um
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
and if if possible it would be great to
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
open it up to some questions since our
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
time is a bit limited today
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
um but before that i did have a quick
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
question for you about
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
um this idea of using taxpayer money um
 
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
and you know the
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
the reasons behind this bill would it be
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
possible to have a couple of
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
examples and scenarios in which you know
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
without this bill taxpayer money
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
would be or currently is being used in
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
order to propagate these concepts um and
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
how does that kind of
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
show up in our society as it is now yeah
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
uh in the manchester school district
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
it showed up as part of a teacher
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
training uh
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
where uh there's a concept and i'm gonna
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
say it and it's gonna sound like i'm
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
supporting something that's bad and i
 
00:21:59.430 --> 00:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
want you to kind of think about
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
what the word means but an
 
00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:03.270 align:start position:0%
what the word means but an
anti-whiteness

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
anti-whiteness
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
training so that was part of the the
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
manchester school district and it's not
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
about whether it's white or black or
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
brown or whatever color it's about
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
dividing people based on skin color and
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
certain people are deficient because
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
they were born a certain way and others
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
you know maybe they're deficient in a
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
different way or but that
 
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
we're not all part of the same society
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
in the same group
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
and so it actually causes the vision um
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know in my view that's what it does
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
is it causes the vision because we're
 
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
all individuals we're all
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
citizens in the same country and
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know you've heard the term systemic
 
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.549 align:start position:0%
you know you've heard the term systemic
racism

00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
racism
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
and there is racism there's a history of
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
racism in our country
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
but when if you this is another thing
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to research if you could
 
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.950 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to research if you could
systemic

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
systemic
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
racism what what they're saying is that
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
the system
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
our the system of our country was
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
designed from the beginning in all its
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
institutions and all the rules and all
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
the laws
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
were designed to perpetuate racism
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
and that's a really big statement i mean
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
that's sort of like calling america nazi
 
00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.909 align:start position:0%
that's sort of like calling america nazi
germany

00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
germany
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
right so we know you know the
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
concentration camps
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh with the jews were bad and america's
 
00:23:24.549 --> 00:23:24.559 align:start position:0%
done some bad things don't get me wrong
 
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
but we're our society is designed to be
 
00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.149 align:start position:0%
but we're our society is designed to be
self-correcting

00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
self-correcting
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
and self-healing so uh to say that we
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
need to throw the whole thing out
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
and have a revolution and you know
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
turn every turn turn over every system
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
and create something new
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
i disagree with that point of view i
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
think the way that our country
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
was set up from the founding allows it
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
to heal itself to self-correct
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
because you know for one thing we have
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
conversations like this or we can
 
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.909 align:start position:0%
conversations like this or we can
disagree

00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
and make up our own minds and that gets
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
us further
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh towards you know what they say a more
 
00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
perfect union
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so much um does anyone else
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
lily about you hi um
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate you telling us all about
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
the bill you know i read the build text
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
and the one thing that i didn't
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
understand is
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
this build wouldn't this bill only make
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
sense if we assume that
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
nobody is given any privilege based on
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
race or gender or sex
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
do you think that is true or do you
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
think that is not true
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about privilege okay
 
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.390 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about privilege okay
yes

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
so uh privilege that term is kind of
 
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:37.750 align:start position:0%
so uh privilege that term is kind of
like

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
a and this is my opinion you can take it
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
for what it's worth
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like a political talking
 
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.470 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like a political talking
point

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
um there are there are lots of types of
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
privilege in the world
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
right if you're if you're attractive to
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
look at or you're not attractive to look
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
at if you're left-handed or right-handed
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
right if you're tall or short if you're
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
the inner fat uh
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
if you're born to wealthy parents or not
 
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.230 align:start position:0%
if you're born to wealthy parents or not
right

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
there's lots of types of privilege uh in
 
00:25:03.909 --> 00:25:03.919 align:start position:0%
the world
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
and by focus by trying to make people
 
00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:07.430 align:start position:0%
and by focus by trying to make people
feel

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
feel
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
guilty for how they were born uh you
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
know collective guilt
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
goes against that idea of individualism
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
that i was telling you about earlier
 
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.110 align:start position:0%
that i was telling you about earlier
that

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh to try to tell someone that they
 
00:25:20.230 --> 00:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
should feel guilty for being born a
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
certain way
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
even if they're born to rich parents
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
right like it could be like lebron
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
lebron james kids or you know just pick
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
an example where
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
it doesn't quite fit the paradigm that
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
um that's just the way the world is we
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
need to come together and uh
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's some of it's hard work on
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
our own part
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
to bridge those gaps and some of it is
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
you sprinkle a little bit of luck on
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
getting ahead but there's lots of types
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
of privilege in the world
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
not just the color of your skin so
 
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that didn't answer my question it did
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
it said it said your question focuses on
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
a very narrow
 
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh aspect of what privilege is in
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
privilege that label has become
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
a uh it's a political talking point and
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
i just described to you that there's
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
lots of types of privilege
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
so okay really if you really if you
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
don't mind i'm going to give an
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to other people for
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
follow-ups and
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
if we have time at the end you can do
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
that yeah that works really quick
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about certain groups
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
gaining political power
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
who do you who are those groups are they
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
groups based on like gender or sex or
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
who are you yeah no it's not based on
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
that it's like
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
it goes back to what i was saying
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
earlier that there's a there's an
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
underlying agenda behind
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
this stuff um and it traces its roots
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
back to marxism and
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
maybe some of you guys think marxism is
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
a great thing but there's been
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know hundreds of millions of people
 
00:26:50.789 --> 00:26:50.799 align:start position:0%
have died because it doesn't actually
 
00:26:50.799 --> 00:26:52.710 align:start position:0%
have died because it doesn't actually
work

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
capitalism capitalism is not great
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
and uh you know we can do some we can
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
improve what we have currently but
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
um you know that that's what i think is
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
underlying this is um
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
trying to control people's actions and
 
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.269 align:start position:0%
trying to control people's actions and
uh

00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
you know i should be free to trade with
 
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
you and you should be free to trade with
 
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:10.789 align:start position:0%
you and you should be free to trade with
me

00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
and we could pull our resources to trade
 
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
with other people
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
that's really you know the way i think
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
things should work um thank you so much
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
we are pressed for time so i wanna
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
get in a couple more questions does
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
i see uh sam's hands been up thank you
 
00:27:29.679 --> 00:27:30.630 align:start position:0%
i see uh sam's hands been up thank you
what

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
yeah hi so thank you representative for
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
coming in and talking to us
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
so my question is uh could a school
 
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.110 align:start position:0%
so my question is uh could a school
district

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
uh give a an implicit bias training
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
to their faculty uh
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
with this bill in effect with this
 
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.510 align:start position:0%
with this bill in effect with this
legislation

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
yeah but you what you couldn't do is say
 
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.510 align:start position:0%
yeah but you what you couldn't do is say
um

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know you couldn't isolate people by
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
how they were born and say you people
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
over here have this kind of implicit
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
bias because you're born a certain way
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
and those people over there they have a
 
00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
different implicit bias because they are
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
born as earthquake
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
as long as you're doing it uniformly
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
treating everybody equally as
 
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:12.870 align:start position:0%
treating everybody equally as
individuals

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
then that there's nothing wrong with
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
that you see the difference there
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you no any further questions
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
i see uh meg has a hand up too go ahead
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
yeah hi um thanks for taking the time to
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
talk with us today
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
um my question is when you um
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
talk about how schools much
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
they can teach about divisive concepts
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
as long as it's
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
in an objective manner
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
and without endorsement um how do you
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
see that
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
being different from the way it's
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
currently taught like do you see a lot
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
of examples where
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
students like you mentioned are being
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
failed because they
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
they won't um accept
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
certain theories
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh we're not i missed the last part of
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
your question it was
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
breaking up meg if you tried to
 
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
turn off your video and try asking the
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
question again that'd be great
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
okay do you hear me now yep
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
okay so my the second part was who gets
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
to determine
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
like like how are you going to review
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
whether it was taught
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
in objective manner without endorsement
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question um in the
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
public school it would be up to
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
um the parents to you know the students
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
and the parents
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
to raise an objection and then it would
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
go to the school board
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
and they would review you know any
 
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
evidence uh for it and maybe that would
 
00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.470 align:start position:0%
evidence uh for it and maybe that would
be

00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know course curricula or what the
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
questions were on the test
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
here's an example in hanover the the
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
hanover school district
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh had a test and it said when
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
when did america become a racist country
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
and it had six multiple choice questions
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
and the correct answer the one that you
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
would pass if you answered correctly
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
was when the declaration of independence
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
was signed that was the correct answer
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
on that test
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
that would be uh an example of
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
you know promoting something uh
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
not objectively and trying to endorse a
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
certain position that you know
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
that would be a pretty blatant example
 
00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.070 align:start position:0%
that would be a pretty blatant example
so

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
all right i want to make sure that we
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
give both sides equal time so um
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
we'll uh have ryan would you like to ask
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
a question we can make that one the
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
final one i can give
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
um snug the uh the other time
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh that's okay i'll let her speak on
 
00:30:57.279 --> 00:30:58.630 align:start position:0%
uh that's okay i'll let her speak on
that

00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay perfect if we have any further
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
questions would we be able to reach you
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
through email so that we can get them
 
00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:04.870 align:start position:0%
through email so that we can get them
answered

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
answered
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%

your opinion on the bill and take some
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
questions yes absolutely
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you so much first of all for
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
inviting me i am so impressed with
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
all of you your questions were brilliant
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
and spot-on
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
um so you heard a lot today uh including
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
capitalism marxism i'm like wow
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm just gonna stick to the bill
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
though so if you don't mind that's the
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
only thing i'd i'd like to address in
 
00:31:59.120 --> 00:31:59.509 align:start position:0%
only thing i'd i'd like to address in
this

00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
in this um meeting so this bill
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh hb 544 is a carbon copy of an
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
executive order that trump issued before
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
leaving presidency
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
um it's important to know that it's
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
important to know that because
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
we need to understand um what the
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
purpose of the bill
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
is and also how it was supposed to get
 
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:20.950 align:start position:0%
is and also how it was supposed to get
applied

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
applied
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
so um we heard that it was an idea from
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
a university professor at least that's
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
what representative ammon has said
 
00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.509 align:start position:0%
what representative ammon has said
publicly

00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
publicly
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
um a university professor from
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
new hampshire uh that and that's why he
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
sponsored the bill but that's
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
really not the case the bill even if it
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
was first introduced in new hampshire
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
as the first state to introduce it in
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature it literally took the
 
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:46.549 align:start position:0%
the legislature it literally took the
exact

00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
exact
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
language of trump's executive order so
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
it's really a part of a greater national
 
00:32:50.799 --> 00:32:51.509 align:start position:0%
it's really a part of a greater national
project

00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
that intends to curb this movement to
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
try to address systemic racism
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
so we know that one of those people
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
being behind this
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
right-wing national project is a man by
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
the name of christopher
 
00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
ruffo who's a former fellow at the
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
heritage foundation
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
so the heritage foundation is a
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
right-wing uh think tank and he actually
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
tweeted this quote
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
he says we have successfully frozen
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
their brand
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
and their brand they meaning those
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
people who are organizing
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
against addressing systemic racism so he
 
00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.350 align:start position:0%
against addressing systemic racism so he
continues

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
continues
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
we have successfully branded their uh
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
bram and then he says
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
critical race theory into the public
 
00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.389 align:start position:0%
critical race theory into the public
conversation

00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
and are steadily driving up negative
 
00:33:34.399 --> 00:33:35.509 align:start position:0%
and are steadily driving up negative
perceptions

00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
perceptions
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
we will eventually turn it toxic as we
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
put all the various cultural insanities
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
under that brand
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
and he continues quote the goal is to
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
have the public read something crazy in
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
the newspaper
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
and immediately think critical race
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
theory we have decodified the term
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
and will recodify it to annex the entire
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
range of cultural
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
constructions that are unpopular with
 
00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.269 align:start position:0%
constructions that are unpopular with
americans

00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
americans
 
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
end quote that was tweeted on may 15
 
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
of this year unfortunately the person
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
who introduced this bill in new
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire representative
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
keith ammon has said publicly in the
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
legislature on video that anyone can
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
look at and see that systemic racism
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
does not exist
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
and claim that our country has rooted
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
out quote the last
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
vestiges already so that's important
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
context to give when talking about this
 
00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:22.869 align:start position:0%
context to give when talking about this
bill

00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
um which is now in the budget which is
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
quite genius honestly because that means
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
you know like the state has to pass the
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
budget so it was kind of smart way to
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
that it tries to get past so about the
 
00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:35.349 align:start position:0%
that it tries to get past so about the
bill

00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
so the bill's language is quite
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
deceiving because on face value it looks
 
00:34:39.359 --> 00:34:40.230 align:start position:0%
deceiving because on face value it looks
harmless

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
harmless
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
but the problem is the divisive concepts
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
which the bill is referring to
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
is literally flipping this idea of
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
racism on its
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
head and calling those who point out
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
systemic racism racists
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
against whites right and those pointing
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
out gender inequality
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
sexist against men so which is
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
absolutely ridiculous
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
so basically it's supposed to protect
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
people who are uncomfortable
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
when the topic of addressing systemic
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
racism comes
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know comes up because they feel
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
their identity somehow is being attacked
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
when people mention how brown and black
 
00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:14.390 align:start position:0%
when people mention how brown and black
community

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
or how women are affected
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
institutionally by racism or sexism
 
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:18.950 align:start position:0%
institutionally by racism or sexism
right

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
so we believe that this is a fake
 
00:35:21.359 --> 00:35:22.310 align:start position:0%
so we believe that this is a fake
problem

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
and um that it's not really an issue
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
like they're making it out to be and the
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
majority of white people
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
and men as well have stated they
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate these conversations
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
about systemic racism and how
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
disproportionately it impacts people
 
00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:38.710 align:start position:0%
disproportionately it impacts people
differently

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
differently
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
in our nations and these difficult
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
conversations have helped them
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
see the way basically that the the
 
00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:45.829 align:start position:0%
see the way basically that the the
system

00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
has benefits them sometimes and and
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
others right
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
um and they say they've now become
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
better advocates because of those
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
conversations so the fact that people
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
are insinuating that when we say that
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
historically and currently women have
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
been discriminated against as a social
 
00:36:01.839 --> 00:36:02.470 align:start position:0%
been discriminated against as a social
group

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
and it's benefiting men as a social
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
group and that society has discriminated
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
against people of color
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
and that somehow will make men or white
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
people feel like you know we're saying
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
women are superior to men or that people
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
of color are superior to white people is
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
is really
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
quite sad and something that really just
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
so um if the the the bill sponsor anyone
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't believe that systemic racism
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
truly exists anymore
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
he and those people that have this
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
belief are the reason why
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
we must have these honest conversations
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
that bills like this would prevent
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
because as long as we keep behaving like
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
everything is okay
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
we'll never address the racism and
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
sexism that plagues uh
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
and harms all of us quite frankly um
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
because you know if we continue to harm
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
women we're literally harming our
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
mothers and sisters when we continue to
 
00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.310 align:start position:0%
mothers and sisters when we continue to
harm

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
harm
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
people of color we're also robbing
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
ourselves of the opportunity to live in
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
an amazing multicultural democracy
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
really fast i also want to address
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
critical race theory because this
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
keeps coming up so critical race theory
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
is this boogeyman
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
that quite interestingly like because
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't address
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
critical race theory at all the notion
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
that one group or people
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
is inherently superior to another group
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
the language from the bill or that
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
like one group of people by virtue of
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
their race or sex ought to feel guilty
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
about the fact that they belong
 
00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
to a race or section none of these
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
things have anything to do with critical
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
race theory
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
critical release theory is basically the
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
shedding light
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
of the fact that racism functions
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
differently today
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
and so this idea of color blindness
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
colorblindness is not allowing us to
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
notice the ways that racism does
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
function in our society today
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's saying that even when race is uh
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's saying basically that
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know racism doesn't have to be
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned for something to be racist
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
right racism still exists
 
00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
and happy and happens even without
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
naming the word um
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
racism so it exists through racial
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
disparities inequality
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
racial discrimination and many like
 
00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
disadvantages that research
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
has shown with data that impacts black
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
brown native americans that's critical
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
race theory
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
and the fact is um in america you know
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
america is racist that's just a fact
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
right and this bill would literally
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
punish me for saying so
 
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
but we have evidence right not just past
 
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
practices but today
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
and also america doesn't have to be
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
racist though
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's the key that's that's why these
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
conversations are necessary and
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
important right we do have a chance to
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
get better
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
to to truly live into that multi-racial
 
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.510 align:start position:0%
to to truly live into that multi-racial
democracy

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
where all of us black brown white can
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
all thrive right
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
um and so talking about systemic racism
 
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:50.390 align:start position:0%
um and so talking about systemic racism
um

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just kind of quickly give
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
like a definition so systemic racism is
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
grounded in history
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
our laws institutions and it combines
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's a combination basically of
 
00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
these systems and factors
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
in the united states that gives
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
advantages to white people
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
and has disadvantaged in access and
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people of color
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about sexism it's
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
going to advantage
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
it's giving an advantage to men for
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
example um that
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
that woman and non-binary peoples don't
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
have access and opportunity as well
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
so um talking about systemic racism and
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
sexism we're talking about things like
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
the fact in new hampshire
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
woman makes 74 cents to every dollar a
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
man makes
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
and it's even worse if you're a woman of
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
color in new hampshire the rates is
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh for we basically rank 45th in the
 
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.630 align:start position:0%
uh for we basically rank 45th in the
nation

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
nation
 
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
for gender pay equality and that's a
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
shame right
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
in higher education it's even worse that
 
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.349 align:start position:0%
in higher education it's even worse that
gap

00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
gap
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
um when we talk about systemic racism
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
we're also talking about the fact that
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
the poverty rate for whites in new
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire was one in 14
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
for blacks it's one and five
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
for the latinx community it's one and
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
six again compare that to one and four
 
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
poverty rate for white granite staters
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
so um also looking about looking at the
 
00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system in new hampshire
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
if the black community is 1.7 percent of
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire population
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
we must ask why do they make up 7 of the
 
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.109 align:start position:0%
we must ask why do they make up 7 of the
prison

00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
prison
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
and jail population so that's what we
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
mean by systemic racism
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
so uh he talks about um uh
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
being objective and subjective uh and so
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is is wildly dangerous because
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
when we're saying that
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
oh you can teach about all these things
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
but you must be
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
you know objective about it one like has
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
like who gets to decide what's objective
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
and subjective
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
right who gets to decide if a student
 
00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
was failed
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
because of this reason or not right um
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
especially in the context that i shared
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
about why the bill was even introduced
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
right which is to curb this this this
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
energy or this movement around
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
addressing systemic racism so many
 
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
people um
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
stated including the president of the
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire business and industry
 
00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.030 align:start position:0%
new hampshire business and industry
association

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
that they are really worried about this
 
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:10.630 align:start position:0%
that they are really worried about this
bill

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
because businesses who get funding from
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
contracts with um trainers basically
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
they contract with trainers and they
 
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:18.630 align:start position:0%
they contract with trainers and they
found

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:18.640 align:start position:0%
found
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
that the conversations are necessary to
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
ensure they aren't engaging in racism
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
and sexism
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
and that these trainings will help them
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
ensure they aren't
 
00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know vulnerable to race and gender
 
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.349 align:start position:0%
you know vulnerable to race and gender
discrimination

00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
so we have teachers doctors businesses
 
00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
all these people who've come out
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
against this bill saying this is really
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
really bad
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
for our state so i know he says it only
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
affects state contractors let's talk
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's important to understand that all
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
all public schools are partially funded
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
by the state so it's going to affect
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
all our public schools right um and then
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
let's talk about hospitals
 
00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
all our hospitals are going to be
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill including
 
00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.349 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill including
dartmouth

00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
dartmouth
 
00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
because we get uh the hospitals get
 
00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:03.030 align:start position:0%
because we get uh the hospitals get
medicaid

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
through state you know through state
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
funds so it's going to affect all
 
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.109 align:start position:0%
funds so it's going to affect all
hospitals

00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
and it's going to affect businesses who
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
contract with this uh with
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
with people giving these trainings who
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
get state funds
 
00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
and then it's also going to affect
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
organizations and advocacy groups
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
who contract um uh with with you know
 
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
with trainers
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
that get funding from the state so
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
literally this is going to affect
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
many many people in in our state and so
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
um yeah i just want to maybe stop there
 
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so much yeah absolutely
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
if not um i have one to begin with but
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
feel free to
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
being i this is kind of to anyone is
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
this bill being brought up in any other
 
00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:57.990 align:start position:0%
this bill being brought up in any other
state

00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
at the moment and if so what's that
 
00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:01.839 align:start position:0%
looking like
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
um if it's already been approved or
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
what they've done with it yes
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
actually it has been introduced in other
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
states in one
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
form or another and i believe there was
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
one state who fully passed it
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
like the governor signed it and
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
everything if i'm not mistaken it's
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
iowa or idaho i can look that and get
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
you that answer
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
i believe yeah sorry to interrupt i
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
believe it i believe it was iowa just
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
because i have some legislators that are
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
friends over there
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
i believe it was that thank you
 
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
um can i add like the interesting thing
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that i do want to
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
mention like i really feel like this is
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
going to create
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
a nanny state you know like in our
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
schools and businesses the schools
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
basically are going to say it's not
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
worth having our funding threatened
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
in a situation when some parents might
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
find something objectionable right so
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
this is really even if like our states
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
or our local
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
governments want to have these
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
conversations they're going to steer
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
away with a bill like this because
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
they're afraid you know they'll get sued
 
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
or whatever it's now a state law so
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
i know that um oh wait i will pass it to
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
ryan and then drew
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to say thank you for
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
really saying that all like
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
succinctly and really highlighting
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
important uh aspects of it because it is
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
important to address the systemic racism
 
00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
racism in not only the united states but
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
our state and i was wondering
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
when we go to say like testify for the
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
bill or talk with other people about it
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
do you have any like tips for us of like
 
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:47.990 align:start position:0%
do you have any like tips for us of like
important

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
um aspects of the build a highlight or
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
anything that could like convey the same
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
message that you did
 
00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
yeah um i could definitely send you some
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
research because i know the legislature
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
loves research
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
so when we say when we're talking about
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
systemic racism this is what we're
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
talking about and i think it's really
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
helpful to say
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
um particularly as white people and as
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
men so
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
men should come to should actually say
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
hey we want to hear how
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
how sexism is you know um manifesting
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
in our state and so i think that'll be a
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
good thing and i think if you're white
 
00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
to say hey we want to hear how racism
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
is manifesting in our state because we
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
can't address these issues if we can't
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so much jude did you have a
 
00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.150 align:start position:0%
thank you so much jude did you have a
question

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
yeah i had a question for everyone i
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
think i personally have
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
never had an agenda of having to
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
say america is racist on a test or
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
anything remotely resembling that
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
um i think if anything the agenda that
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
has affected
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
me or maybe not the agenda but is the
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
omission of certain events
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
in american history that could be
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
construed as racist or sexist
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
or maybe the complete omission of things
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
like the gay rights movement
 
00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
in schools that is more what i've been
 
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
affected by
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to just ask everyone has
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
anyone ever had a personal experience
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
with anything
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
um resembling what representative animan
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
was talking about
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm so i'm just gonna um is are
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
there any other final questions um for
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
asthma before we
 
00:46:25.109 --> 00:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
um go into discussion and i i don't want
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
to disrupt the conversation but at least
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
um and the questioning i have one if no
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
one else does
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
um can i just piggyback off of that
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
wonderful question because
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
i also haven't seen any any proof
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
of teachers ever telling any students
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
born racist never so when these
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
allegations are made
 
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to say i just don't believe
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
any teacher has ever said yes
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
i believe white people are born racist
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
and these are you know some examples
 
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
like i've never heard that so if people
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
are out alleging that that has happened
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
they have to come forth with some real
 
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.710 align:start position:0%
they have to come forth with some real
proof

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
proof
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
that this is what teachers are actually
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
saying because what teachers are doing
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
is saying because of systemic racism
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
whether through you know the way we're
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
portrayed in the media or movies
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
um we develop biases and we need to be
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
aware of them to dismantle them right
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
so that's just another point that i just
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
want to say because i've never there was
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
never real proof of any teacher saying
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
people are born racist
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's okay that's what my
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
question hinges around so
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
i'll be very quick um i i know that
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
rights and democracy does a lot of work
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
centered around human rights and
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
um diversity equity inclusion um so at
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom of this bill it says
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i quote that nothing shall prevent
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
agencies or contractors from promoting
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
racial cultural or ethnic diversity or
 
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:46.950 align:start position:0%
racial cultural or ethnic diversity or
inclusiveness

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
inclusiveness
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
as long as they comply with this bill um
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to hear your thoughts on
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
that because
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
and this is my own understanding but if
 
00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:54.230 align:start position:0%
and this is my own understanding but if
you

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
prohibit the discussion of the reasons
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
for which there may be a lack of
 
00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:58.309 align:start position:0%
for which there may be a lack of
diversity

00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
diversity
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
and inclusivity to begin with wouldn't
 
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
it be rather ineffective to
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
promote diversity and inclusion
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
especially through you know
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
education and foster that kind of
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
inclusive workspace if we aren't able to
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
address the root causes and um i wanted
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
to hear your thoughts on that especially
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
as someone who works for diversity and
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
equity and inclusion
 
00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so um i guess i want to make sure i
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
got the question right are you saying
 
00:48:24.069 --> 00:48:24.079 align:start position:0%
that if we aren't having these
 
00:48:24.079 --> 00:48:25.589 align:start position:0%
that if we aren't having these
conversations

00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
then um there's no way to actually be
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
able to address
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
the issues of racism and sexism yes
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
exactly so
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
um you know encourage agency employees
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
not to judge each other by their color
 
00:48:39.119 --> 00:48:39.990 align:start position:0%
not to judge each other by their color
racism

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
racism
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
ethnicity sex or any other
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
characteristic but
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
is there any how can we do that if um we
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
are not discussing the underlying causes
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
for any discrimination
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's precisely it you literally
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
answered your own question and you're
 
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:52.549 align:start position:0%
answered your own question and you're
brilliant

00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
brilliant
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
so you just say that we're we'll be
 
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:55.589 align:start position:0%
so you just say that we're we'll be
wonderful

00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
transition over to a quick conversation
 
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to have a kind of a deadline
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
much for joining us
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
it was very helpful to hear these
 
00:49:24.309 --> 00:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
perspectives um and i think this is now
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
our time as a council to bring forth any
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
sort of questions you might have for
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
each other
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
um and also just any thoughts we have
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
and our goal is to be able to vote on
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation so i think
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps the first thing to think about
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
is do you feel prepared to vote on it
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
and is there anything you'd like to
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
discuss and hash out before we do so
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any sort of points they
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
want to bring up oh representative ammon
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to say uh i'll leave
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
you guys to your deliberation
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
um going first was a little bit of a
 
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:54.870 align:start position:0%
um going first was a little bit of a
disadvantage

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to talk about any
 
00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.069 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to talk about any
rebuttals

00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
rebuttals
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
later uh in you know the opposition we
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
live in a society where
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
we get to have two we get to hear both
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
sides of an argument and that's how we
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
get to the truth so
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you letting me uh talk to
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
you and i'm gonna
 
00:50:12.549 --> 00:50:12.559 align:start position:0%
disappear and let you guys deliberate
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you so much for
 
00:50:14.559 --> 00:50:17.990 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you so much for
coming

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
all right i'll open it up to anyone who
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
might have any thoughts maybe we can
 
00:50:24.069 --> 00:50:24.079 align:start position:0%
start with your question jude um for
 
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
everyone which is really centered around
 
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:25.990 align:start position:0%
everyone which is really centered around
have

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
you experienced any situations
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
um that propagate these divisive
 
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.150 align:start position:0%
um that propagate these divisive
concepts

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
concepts
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
in the way that is outlined in this bill
 
00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:38.390 align:start position:0%
in the way that is outlined in this bill
um

00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
what do you all think feel free to just
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
unmute yourselves this is really our
 
00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
time and i think
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
i would say i definitely have not where
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
a teacher is prompted that
 
00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:55.839 align:start position:0%
exact discussion saying that america
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
is like racist where it absolutely is i
 
00:50:59.599 --> 00:50:59.910 align:start position:0%
is like racist where it absolutely is i
think

00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
based on the very foundation and the way
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
african americans people of color women
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
were treated
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
during its creation and today but i
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
because people feel uncomfortable when
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
we do bring up these topics like the
 
00:51:16.309 --> 00:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
civil rights movement slavery in school
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
i think that like some people might feel
 
00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
targeted and that brings them to think
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
oh like they're saying that white people
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
are racist or america is racist
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
whereas really they're just being
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
presented the facts of what happened
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
and it's like well yes it did and
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
that is what happened so i don't know i
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
don't think people are directly being
 
00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.109 align:start position:0%
don't think people are directly being
told

00:51:37.109 --> 00:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
told
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and if i may uh to just back off
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
that i think that
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh the idea that
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
any discussion around systemic racism
 
00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
will you know will equal
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh guilt i think that's
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
misguided i think that you know
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
in my school we've been able to have
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
some very nuanced mature conversations
 
00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.430 align:start position:0%
some very nuanced mature conversations
about

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
systemic racism and how real it is and
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.309 --> 00:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
um somewhat building off what sam just
 
00:52:14.319 --> 00:52:15.510 align:start position:0%
um somewhat building off what sam just
said

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
when when i discuss like white privilege
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
within school i've never heard someone
 
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:24.309 align:start position:0%
within school i've never heard someone
say

00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
like you have white privilege you should
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
feel really guilty it's more of an
 
00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:30.870 align:start position:0%
feel really guilty it's more of an
acknowledgement

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement
 
00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's more like i understand
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
that this is something that
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
is unfair and that might happen to me
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
because of my race and it's something we
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
need a change
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
but not something you need to feel
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
guilty about because
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
you can't really do anything about it as
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
obviously i can't change my race so i
 
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:51.750 align:start position:0%
obviously i can't change my race so i
think

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
this bill might prevent some discussions
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
such as that happening
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
within schools and
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think going upon that and um one of my
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
main things with the bill and i think
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
brian touched on
 
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
is like who gets to decide whether or
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
not something is difficult concept so as
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative and was talking about
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's like um the onus is on the parent
 
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
or the child to like bring it up to the
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
school board
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
and then from the school board right
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
then we go further and i think the thing
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
is that we
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
all kind of when making these decisions
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
right we probably already have
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
preconceived notions
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
as we were talking about like someone
 
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
probably already knows where they fall
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
on whether or not they think america is
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
like a racist country for example and so
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
i think then at the end they just come
 
00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
back to politics and i think
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day it's kind of
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
deciding right and having like this
 
00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.870 align:start position:0%
deciding right and having like this
objective

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
objective
 
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
standard is kind of missing from the
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
spill saying okay
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
um this is where we draw the line and
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
for me that's kind of one of my main
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
issues with
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
this film
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
back breaking up with carson i think i
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
think that's a very good point because
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
we can talk about things as far as like
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
oh what's right or wrong but i think the
 
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
most important thing when we're thinking
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
about our students and educators is
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
what's going to make people the most
 
00:54:09.119 --> 00:54:10.549 align:start position:0%
what's going to make people the most
comfortable

00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
and in my mind the people that are going
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
to be the most
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable are going to be those
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
groups that are marginalized that might
 
00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.589 align:start position:0%
groups that are marginalized that might
be

00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
getting that might be experiencing these
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
in like inequalities but we can't talk
 
00:54:23.030 --> 00:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
i feel like the people that the people
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say privilege because
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
that's the whole com another
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
conversation that
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
um we can get into but like who is who
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
is truly being
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
made uncomfortable and will this bill
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
make them more comfortable or less
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
comfortable like
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
how is this actually going to affect the
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
yeah for sure and then there's also the
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
whole freedom of speech angle like
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
it might create this culture where you
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
know as as carson pointed out
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is rather vague and kind of
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
saying what what is divisive i mean
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
there are a few definitions but like
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
something could you know make me angry
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
just because i haven't reckoned with my
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
own privilege
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know that again as lisa that's
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
getting into like a whole other
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
conversation but
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know do i get to decide what is and
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
isn't divisive
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
do the three sponsors of this bill who i
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
might add
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
are white and male get to decide um
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
like who who has that chance and then it
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
might create this culture within schools
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
and within the government
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
of people trying to you know scope out
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
and twist words and report each other
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure whether that's like in
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
the interest of freedom of speech and
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
also just creating that inclusive
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
community like i'm
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
i would be worried about the
 
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.309 align:start position:0%
i would be worried about the
consequences

00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
um just you know of this whole reporting
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism which isn't very clear
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the bill itself as well as as carson
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
said when it comes to putting that
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
owners on the parents
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
and on the students and on the employees
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
how will that be reported how will
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
what kind of repercussions will there be
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
if the teacher
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
within a school promotes or like talks
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
about systemic racism
 
00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
would that mean that eventually the
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
state's contract with the entire school
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
would be terminated cutting the funding
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
and the education for an entire
 
00:56:03.119 --> 00:56:03.750 align:start position:0%
and the education for an entire
district's

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
district's
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
students like i'm not entirely sure but
 
00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.109 align:start position:0%
students like i'm not entirely sure but
that's

00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
that's something that i think is worth
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree i think overall this bill
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
would like
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
almost scare like teachers or
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
administrations from
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
from and steer them away from talking
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
about like important issues
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
or important like historical events and
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
stuff because they wouldn't want to get
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
penalized for this and hurt their school
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
funding or get in trouble with their
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
school and stuff like that i think it
 
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
would just
 
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any other thoughts um
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
how do we feel about voting on this do
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
we feel like we have enough
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
um i just i just kind of want a little
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
bit of feedback has this been helpful to
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
do a kind of a panel of style i think on
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm seeing nods so i'm think on
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
like positions of contentious bills
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
maybe next year
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
um i was talking to a link a little bit
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
about it but uh
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
you know kind of give me a heads up of
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
what we wanted to talk about and then
 
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.030 align:start position:0%
what we wanted to talk about and then
invite

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
invite
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
um a pro and against for the bills that
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
we can kind of hear from people and then
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh respond that way so i think this
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
conversation has been great
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh regardless of where i personally
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
stand on the position and representative
 
00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:22.870 align:start position:0%
stand on the position and representative
ammon

00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
ammon
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
i just want to thank the council for
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
where they
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know their vote and their opinion so
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and i i think you know as
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
exemplified by the nods it's been super
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
helpful because
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes just breaking down a nebulous
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
bill into
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know something that makes sense and
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
we can vote on knowing
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
different sides can be really tough and
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
this was really helpful
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
wait a roll call but okay i think
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
molly you're taking minutes are you good
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
so there should be a motion there should
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
be a motion from somebody
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
to support or oppose and then the
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
vote would be whether whatever the
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
motion is do you support
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
like yes to the motion or no emotion
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
okay i'm motioned to oppose
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
all right um going down the list
 
00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:20.829 align:start position:0%
all right um going down the list
alphabetically

00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
alphabetically
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
carson uh i will support the motion to
 
00:58:23.599 --> 00:58:26.630 align:start position:0%
carson uh i will support the motion to
oppose

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
isabelle i support the motion to
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
oppose i also support the motion to
 
00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:42.150 align:start position:0%
oppose i also support the motion to
oppose

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
casey i support the motion
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
let's see um lily i support the motion
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
matti i support the motion
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
meg i support the motion too
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
reed i support the motion
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
ryan i support the motion sam
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
i support the motion to oppose
 
00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
all right good work everybody and it's
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
exactly four
 
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
that was a lot accomplished in an hour
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
so good job everyone
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
um rob alexander what do you think are
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
the next steps for this bill since it's
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
um in the budget as well and
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
yeah in terms of us making our opinion
 
00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.030 align:start position:0%
yeah in terms of us making our opinion
heard

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
so the 544 i looked on the docket that's
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
been tabled
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
um um in the basically the
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
the bill is is um in in the budget that
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
was passed by the house so the house
 
00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:46.870 align:start position:0%
was passed by the house so the house
position

00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
um so i guess i would
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
say to draft up a statement and send it
 
00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
out saying you oppose the content
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
of what's in um 544
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
and most legislators will understand
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
that and send it to the house as well as
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
all right right now right now the
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
budget's in the senate's hands so
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
um it will come back to the house but
 
01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
the house is already voted on 544
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
basically in the in the button sounds
 
01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:15.109 align:start position:0%
basically in the in the button sounds
good

01:00:15.109 --> 01:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
all right um in that case we will write
 
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
up an email with
 
01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
all the information on this and don't
 
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.640 align:start position:0%
forget to check out the google drive and
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
all the spreadsheets there just so that
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
we can keep working
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
um keep testifying and we'll also send
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
out a document so we can all collaborate
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
on a statement on this given that this
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
is something that we've all
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
sort of been discussing together and
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's overarching
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
um for the council um and i know that we
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
probably have to adjourn
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
soon so before that do you have any
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
questions or thoughts um
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
so next meeting we just talked um a link
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
and i talked
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
can you just address that first and kind
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%
of what we're going to talk about and
 
01:00:55.839 --> 01:00:56.549 align:start position:0%
of what we're going to talk about and
then

01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
you can adjourn absolutely so our next
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
meeting we're considering
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
june 13th so if as soon as we get that
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
scheduled we'll let you know
 
01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
um and the goal for next meeting is to
 
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
have sort of an open discussion
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
on how the council went this year what
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
progress we've made
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
ways we can be more effective next year
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
and also talking about how we can
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
continue taking action over the summer
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
even when we might not be meeting
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
especially since some of the bills that
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
we've voted on
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
are probably going to be worked on over
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
the summer by different committees and
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
will want to be involved in some
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
capacity so
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
next meeting's kind of going to be an
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
open discussion type
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
meeting so we can recap brainstorm for
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
ways to just make the council
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
run more smoothly and also plan for next
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
year and
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
it looks like we'll be able to have a
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
summit at the state house hopefully
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
in august so that's the goal we're
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
working towards that
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
um and rep alexander is also working on
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
organizing a
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
possible meeting in august as well with
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%

01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%

01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
