you uh depending upon the volume of uh
 
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
prospective speakers sometimes
 
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
we're required by circumstances to limit
 
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
testimony uh don't like to do that but
 
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh if we have uh many many many people
 
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
want to speak we want to honor their
 
00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
presence and if we need to we will uh
 
00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
limit uh testimony times we're not at at
 
00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
this time because I don't see a need for
 
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 align:start position:0%

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
I will say that and I'll repeat this
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
later in the day at other hearings um
 
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
the committee is very interested that's
 
00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
why we're here is to is to learn more
 
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
about these measures now if someone has
 
00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
explained a piece of the measure a piece
 
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill or the resolution already uh
 
00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
you don't need to repeat that okay so uh
 
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 align:start position:0%
we don't need to hear the same um Point
 
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 align:start position:0%
uh multiple times over so I would ask
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
that if a point that you think is
 
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
important has already been made uh we
 
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
have that it's also on YouTube so we
 
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
don't need to to repeat that so at this
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
time let's get started uh with the first
 
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
measure of this ambitious schedule that
 
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
is CAC
 
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
R20 the prime sponsor for that is
 
00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative geard and he is in the
 
00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
house uh representative Gard welcome and
 
00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
go thank you chairman members of the
 
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
committee Jason Gard Northfield Franklin
 
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.550 align:start position:0%
committee Jason Gard Northfield Franklin
marac

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
marac
 
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
25 the measure before us today cacr 20
 
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.830 align:start position:0%
25 the measure before us today cacr 20
would

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
declare independence from the United
 
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
States of America for New Hampshire if
 
00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 align:start position:0%
the national debt reaches $40
 
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
trillion we would proceed as a Sovereign
 
00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
Nation the reason for bringing this
 
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
measure forward is because I like many
 
00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
Americans right now feel that the
 
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
national government is taking this whole
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
country on a course
 
00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
that quite simply is leading us to
 
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
financial insolvency at a rapid
 
00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
Pace online you know we have many of
 
00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
these debt clocks and we're already over
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
40 34 trillion when we hit 40 trillion
 
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but it's going to happen
 
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than
 
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
later and I'm concerned that as many
 
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
have said the national debt is the
 
00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
greatest National Security risk that we
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
face so this is a measure to prevent New
 
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from falling
 
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.629 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from falling
[Music]

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
into a catastrophe that I don't think
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
the world has seen before since we do
 
00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 align:start position:0%
have the reserve currency and they are
 
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
printing it like it's going out of style
 
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
so just a little fact sheet that you'll
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
find on your tables that was
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
provided this legislation to State what
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
this actually does this legislation
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
proposes an amendment following article
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
seven of the New Hampshire Constitution
 
00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
that if the US national debt reaches 40
 
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
trillion New Hampshire shall peacefully
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
declare peacefully I'm sorry declare
 
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
independence from the United States this
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
legislation will be submitted and placed
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
on a ballot for qualified voters at the
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
general state election November 2024 the
 
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
wording of the question put to the
 
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
qualifi voter shall be placed in a yes
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
or no answer context if the proposed
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is approved by 2third of those
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
voting on the amendment it becomes
 
00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 align:start position:0%
effective when the governor proclaims
 
00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:43.350 align:start position:0%
effective when the governor proclaims
its

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
its
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
adoption with the current national debt
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
of 34 trillion and its projection to
 
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
rise I mean it can't go anywhere but up
 
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
at this point this legislation addresses
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
concerns about future Financial
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
standings and relationship between state
 
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
and federal governments this legislation
 
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
does not call for New Hampshire's
 
00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:58.759 align:start position:0%
immediate secession from the United
 
00:06:58.759 --> 00:06:59.990 align:start position:0%
immediate secession from the United
States

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
prompt a vote on New Hampshire
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
Independence in the general state
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
election in November 2024 or change
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
status of New Hampshire as a state
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
States well there's there's plenty of
 
00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
people who want to testify so I'll kind
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
of limit my testimony but if there's any
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
questions I'd be happy to answer them
 
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 align:start position:0%
right now conning why this was put
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
forward but in general my feeling is
 
00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
that this country is on a course that's
 
00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
unsustainable and danger to the values
 
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
and Liberties that New Hampshire holds
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
sacred so hence this being brought
 
00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919 align:start position:0%
forward thank you representative I I do
 
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
have one question that I will ask uh of
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
you uh it's the same question we had a
 
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
last term we had a a similar secession
 
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
type measure that came to this committee
 
00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
I was vice chair at the time and I and
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to repeat the same question to
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
you that I asked the prime sponsor of
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
that measure that has to do with the the
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
Pledge of Allegiance which refers to one
 
00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.230 align:start position:0%
Pledge of Allegiance which refers to one
nation

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
nation
 
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
indivisible um so I I have to assume and
 
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
I'm repeating the question I asked last
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
time um that you you don't do not
 
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
believe in or do not say the Pledge of
 
00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
Allegiance because it of the
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
indivisible uh part of the Pledge I
 
00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
actually don't say the Pledge of
 
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
Allegiance because I believe we can only
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
serve one master and my master is not
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
government so that's kind of how I feel
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
about the situation in general I believe
 
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
that you should worship the Creator and
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
not the creation
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
so that's how I go about it myself
 
00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
personally thank you and one followup
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
and this is the same followup I asked
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the introducer last term and and
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
that has to do with some history and
 
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
then we all go through the Hall of flags
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
um into the State House the regimental
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
colors from the Civil War over 4,000 New
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire men died during the Civil War
 
00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
countless thousands others injured
 
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
wounded uh so the these people these
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice
 
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
because they believe that this nation as
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
Lincoln said should be indivi
 
00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:10.519 align:start position:0%
indivisible so my question is how do you
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
reconcile this measure with the
 
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
sacrifices of these of these men and in
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
these uh in the hollow flags of
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
regimental colors some of them are Blood
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
Stained so if you could just help us
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
understand how you reconcile that sure I
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
would this is something I was going to
 
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
bring up my testimony but I decided not
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
to but now I will growing up just this
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
is going somewhere just follow me second
 
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
growing up in I was a freshman when 91
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
happened in high school and I remember
 
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
that the whole thing was about we got to
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
keep people that we don't know where
 
00:09:46.269 --> 00:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
they're coming from out of this country
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
because we got to secure our borders and
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
etc etc and now we see the border is
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
completely wide open there is no even
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
pretense of preventing any so-called
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
terrorists from entering the country I
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
just feel
 
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.150 align:start position:0%
just feel
that

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
the we we the things not the things the
 
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
Liberties that those men died for are
 
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
not being upheld today including the
 
00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
actual defense of our borders so this my
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
point being is that the country that
 
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
they died for is not actually in
 
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
existence right now all of our
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment are being
 
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
trampled at every level I think Edward
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
Snowden kind of proved that pretty
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
explicitly so we're kind of in this
 
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.470 align:start position:0%
explicitly so we're kind of in this
weird

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
weird
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
ersat Nation status where we don't
 
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
actually have the Liberties that we're
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
we supposedly do on paper and that's
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about so those men
 
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
died for something yes but the they they
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
did they die for what we have right now
 
00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:49.639 align:start position:0%
a federal government that tramples on
 
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
every single one of our rights that's
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's my concern those men died yes but
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
what did they die for did they die for
 
00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
what we see right now happening a
 
00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:00.399 align:start position:0%
current that is completely worthless and
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
increasingly so every day a country
 
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
that's involved in Wars all over the
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
place I think we just started launching
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
attack on Yemen I saw on Twitter briefly
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
this morning I can't even keep up I just
 
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
so that's what I'm concerned about those
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
men died for the benefit of the people
 
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
that live within this country and their
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
their posterity and we don't see that I
 
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
mean look at conqueror we always
 
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
homeless we got roving bands of homeless
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
people so that's that's what I'm really
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about is the actual people who
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
live in this country and who fight for
 
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
this country including the veterans of
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
which 6,000 commit suicide every
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
day they're not being supported by the
 
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
very government that we we are told we
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
have to pledge allegiance to they're not
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
pledging allegiance to us so I'm not
 
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
sure if that answers your question I
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
kind of meandered a little bit but
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's what happens we don't have
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
prepared mors so thank you we that that
 
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
helps and um I think the the suicide
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
rate is not 6,000 a day I year I'm sorry
 
00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
I said year that that sounds right okay
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
that because that's something that this
 
00:12:03.629 --> 00:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
committee does pay attention to thank
 
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
you for that other questions for uh
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
representative Philo sure thank you Mr
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative in
 
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
1869 the Supreme Court in Texas versus
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
white ruled that attempts at secession
 
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
were quote absolutely null and that the
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
United States is indivisible that
 
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case has never been
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
overruled given that in what way is the
 
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
present measure constitutional under
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
Texas versus
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
white well I would first three points to
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
that one I don't really think nine men
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
in black dresses has any say on our
 
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
Liberty second I believe the Declaration
 
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
of Independence holds weight and third
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
article 10 of the State Constitution and
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
article 7 State sovereignty but article
 
00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
10 right to Revolution I don't think
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
that some federal bureaucrats could
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
determine that our state constitution is
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
null and void of which article 7 and 10
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
primarily uh represent
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
finny thank you f a question um your
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
belief um you know you would believe
 
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
Congress is too far gone but if we if we
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
could have had an article 5 convention
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
to propose an amendment to Reign and
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal spending could we could we you
 
00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.310 align:start position:0%
fiscal spending could we could we you
know

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
maybe you know you know
 
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
um put more of the defenses the
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
Constitution against the federal
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
government than just you know saying
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
that we're going to leave the union and
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
then that's
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
it I don't believe at this time that's
 
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
actually possible the corruption has
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
reached such a level it's actually hard
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
to Fathom the numbers are so huge so for
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
instance on September 10th 2001 A lot of
 
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:49.720 align:start position:0%
people don't realize Donald Rumsfeld our
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
illustrious previous Secretary of
 
00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
Defense he announced that I believe it
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
was something in the line of $2.1
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
trillion was unaccounted for in their
 
00:13:58.829 --> 00:13:58.839 align:start position:0%
audit and the Pentagon has never
 
00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959 align:start position:0%
actually passed an audit so me that's
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
just one example but I do think the
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
military-industrial complex is a leading
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
cause of our woses but I think that at
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
this point there there's just such an
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
entrenched Bure I don't even know if you
 
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
want to call it deep state bureaucracy
 
00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:17.759 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it these
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
people are so far underground I don't
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
think it's possible to to pull them up
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
like turn-ups I think we just have to
 
00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
kind of walk away and say Hey you have
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
obviously some issues with accounting
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
and basic math and we have some issues
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
with funding an Empire at this point so
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
we got to kind of we need to take care
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
of people in this state that's what we
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
need to do that's our primary concern as
 
00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:41.759 align:start position:0%
legislators I that's Lisa that's what I
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
was under the impression of
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
so I guess that's my answer to
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
that other questions for the prime
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
Gagney thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
question the sake of argument suppose
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
this um H cacr would pass the people
 
00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:07.759 align:start position:0%
would vote it in by
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
2third so we would separate from the
 
00:15:11.749 --> 00:15:11.759 align:start position:0%
rest of this
 
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
country it takes money to be independent
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
to be your own country so how if this
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
thing passes would we support ourselves
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
we have an 18-mile Coastline we would
 
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
have to have raise an army for all our
 
00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:30.519 align:start position:0%
borders Etc and Etc and Etc so what is
 
00:15:32.189 --> 00:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
your plan for
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
that my plan is that I'm a carpenter I
 
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
hit nails with a hammer I am not one to
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
speak on larger issues as far as how we
 
00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
would organize ourselves but I believe
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
that within this state we have a lot of
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
intelligent people who could figure that
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
out and quite frankly I mean if you want
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
a personal example I would say that as
 
00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
far as money goes we have to actually
 
00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
start getting back to real money so this
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
is a project where they found a way to
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
print gold on the plastic so it's a
 
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
thousands of an ounce it's worth $4 but
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
the point being is we need to kind of go
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
back to reality and the fact of the
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
matter is the dollars that they're
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
printing are completely worthless and
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
the only reason anybody accepts them is
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
because it's the Petro dollar that oil
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
is purchased in dollars that's the only
 
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
reason it's any worth does that make any
 
00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
sense so we it's not a matter of money
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of wealth we simply need
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
to separate ourselves from the um well
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
the extortion racket that is the IRS and
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
keeping our money here I believe we
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
could entirely support ourselves oh one
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
last thing I wanted to mention just it's
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
ties in Texas is putting secession on
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
their Republican primary ballot this
 
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
year and I forget the percentages but
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
it's we somebody else will definitely
 
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:43.880 align:start position:0%
mention this so this is not just a New
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thing where we're going to
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
have to support ourselves on maple syrup
 
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
sales there is a movement throughout the
 
00:16:52.309 --> 00:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
country to regulate and bring back the
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
Federal Government under the chains of
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
the Constitution as the founders termed
 
00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
it other questions
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
followup thank you Mr chairman so if I
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
hear you right you're thinking that
 
00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:08.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps we have a revolution possible
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
Revolution on the horizon uh would my
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
assessment be correct on that or or
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
not I would say that we're already in
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
the early stages of Revolution with a
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
major Invasion occurring daily but on
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
top of that we have article 10 and state
 
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
constitution the right to Revolution so
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
I would say that the indiv the men who
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
created our constitution fora a time
 
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
when the people of New Hampshire may
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
have to peacefully remove themselves
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
from an entity that was trying to
 
00:17:39.679 --> 00:17:42.669 align:start position:0%
from an entity that was trying to
tyrannize

00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.789 --> 00:17:44.799 align:start position:0%
them other
 
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none for the prime
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor thank you representative thank
 
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
you very much representative Granger has
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh submitted a card he opposes the bill
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
he's asked for two minutes uh
 
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.390 align:start position:0%
he's asked for two minutes uh
representative

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
Granger

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michael Granger I'm
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
here representing straford District 2
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
Glenn Bailey back there he's in the same
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
district as me and uh that's Rochester
 
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
Ward 5 Milton and Milton Mills and it's
 
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
been said that a bill is just a
 
00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:20.679 align:start position:0%
conversation until it actually gets
 
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
signed so I hopefully my contribution to
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
this Con uh conversation will be useful
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
and help hopefully convince anyone who
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
supports the session that it is not
 
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
exactly the Panacea they think it is um
 
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
representative Gard mentioned that we
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
need to get back to reality I am a
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
strong believer that you must deal with
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
reality on reality's terms in fact I
 
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
consider it the Bedrock of Sanity if you
 
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
do not deal with reality on reality's
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
terms then you're not dealing you're
 
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be doing very well
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
in anything you attempt to do in life so
 
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
in in pursuit of reality I'd like to
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
point out that the United States is a
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
Democratic Republic whether people want
 
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
it to be a Democratic Republic whether
 
00:18:57.789 --> 00:18:57.799 align:start position:0%
they have principles that are above and
 
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
beyond a Democratic Republic it just is
 
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
what it is it currently is a Democratic
 
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
Republic the Democracy part is where we
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
vote for Representatives uh so all of us
 
00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
were elected by Democratic means the
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
Republic part is where we're cons we're
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
supposedly constrained by Constitution
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
we try we we don't stick to it very well
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
um but that's it's supposed to be
 
00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
constrained um democracy is such an old
 
00:19:23.549 --> 00:19:23.559 align:start position:0%
idea that people often forget why it was
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
invented in the first place back in
 
00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:26.919 align:start position:0%
Athens because Athens is remembered for
 
00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
two things inv ing democracy and
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
democratically voting to have Socrates
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
kill himself that's what it was there
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
for and it wasn't until the Republic was
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
introduced to the mix that a little bit
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
more sanity was sort of introduced to to
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
the governance scenario from democracy
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
but what democracy really was supposed
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
to solve the problem that it was
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to solve was that you had these
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
Empires and these great personalities
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
that were constantly battling over who
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
gets to tell everyone what to do who
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
gets to rule and they noticed something
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
Whoever has the bigger armor Army
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
has a tendency to win so they thought
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
well why don't we just skip the whole
 
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
War part and just count how many
 
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
soldiers you have we count how many
 
00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
soldiers we have and then we agreed from
 
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
there and democracy was born uh it isn't
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
always a perfect representation of who
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
would actually win the battle uh but
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
it's generally a pretty good pretty good
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
litmus so this let's go to why having a
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
secession happen at the state level is a
 
00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
bad idea all right let's assume 100 % of
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents vote in favor of
 
00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:33.799 align:start position:0%
secession the United States population
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
is over 300 million the population of
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a little less than 1.5
 
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
million therefore the Dem Democratic
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
process if we have it in New Hampshire
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
is not a proxy for the war it's only a
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
proxy for war if all the people on the
 
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
battlefield are voting and if they're
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
not voting then it's it's not going to
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
represent what would actually end up
 
00:20:59.110 --> 00:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
happening therefore we'd lose and I you
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
guys have heard me speak on defending
 
00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
guard in the past I'm a very very
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
anti-war person I don't want to deal
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
with a war especially in my backyard I
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
also don't want to deal with having to
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
go through a DHS checkpoint every time I
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
go to church because my church is in
 
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
Maine it's across a bridge I live on the
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
Sam falls River I cross the cross the
 
00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:17.799 align:start position:0%
river and then I can go to church I
 
00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:18.919 align:start position:0%
don't want to go through a DHS
 
00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
checkpoint I don't like go I don't even
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
like flying airplanes because I don't
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
want to ride on with the T I don't want
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
to deal with the TSA so as I I agree
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
with a lot of the principles of the
 
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
people who are supporting secession um
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
on the point of the con uh the
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution the founding of the United
 
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
States is through the Declaration of
 
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0%
Independence we can appeal directly to
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
the people if we disagree with the
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's interpretation of the
 
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution but I don't think we really
 
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
should in this case because I don't
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
think that that's a really good idea um
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately as much as I agree with a lot
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
of the principles and ideals of the
 
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
secessionists it just doesn't make any
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
sense thank you thank you representative
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh will you take questions if there are
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
any sure are there any questions uh
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative finny I just have one
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um how do you think that we
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
should deal with not just at New
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but as a country with the
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
issue of our debt it is our biggest you
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
know security issue but overall like it
 
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:start position:0%
will collapse eventually we will go
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
through the worst Economic Times in in
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
history how do we how do we like I'm
 
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
either prepare for that or deal with the
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
reality of that impending doom I guess
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
so uh I actually have testimony that I
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
prepared in this room but for a
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
completely different committee um for
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
another bill I am going to be speaking
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
on two different gold bills this year um
 
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
one of them was a bill to create a state
 
00:22:46.269 --> 00:22:46.279 align:start position:0%
depository and have some sort of goldb
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
currency which is authorized in the
 
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh explicitly by uh saying
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
that states can actually me their own
 
00:22:54.269 --> 00:22:54.279 align:start position:0%
gold money and all that jazz which is an
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
interesting concept and then I also have
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
one in my own committee which is in the
 
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
labor committee um to allow gold and
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
silver for the payment of wages and I
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
believe that when it comes to the
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
reserve currency status that the United
 
00:23:10.029 --> 00:23:10.039 align:start position:0%
States has uh we have a we have to look
 
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.200 align:start position:0%
at history on this a typical World
 
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
Reserve currency lasts 80 to 110 years
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
that has been a pattern that has emerged
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
since the 1400s every Reserve currency
 
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
since the 1400s has lasted between 80
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
and 110 years we're due um now on the
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
other one thing you got to realize is
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
currency collapses of world Reserve
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
currencies happen fairly regularly the
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
last time it happened was uh the British
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
pound sterling and in World War II that
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
was the final death Nowell it was
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
already not doing very well since World
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
War I but when uh the when the pound
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
sterling eventually really did die it
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
wasc it was in 1944 and they had to
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
start backing their currency instead of
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
in Gold because they didn't have any
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
gold anymore they started backing their
 
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
currency in dollars and that's how
 
00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
America became the world Reserve
 
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
currency in the first place now it takes
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
I believe that the actual mechanism
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
whereby the a a world Reserve currency
 
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
dies is that it takes a certain amount
 
00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
of time for the generation that made
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
that currency great to to die due to
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
their own natural causes and for us to
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
have a generation in charge of that
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
currency that doesn't understand the
 
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
fundamentals and I believe we're at that
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
point and I don't believe secession is
 
00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
the cure because it's not like if the
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
dollar dies we're going to you know have
 
00:24:30.389 --> 00:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
if we suceed we're better it we we need
 
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
to have a better look at the actual
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
fundamentals and we need to prepare for
 
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
the shock that is going to come when the
 
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.389 align:start position:0%
the shock that is going to come when the
dollar

00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
dies other
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
representative Granger thank you very
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
much I hear you about TSA I've signed up
 
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
for pre-screening I'd recommend you
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
taking a look at that as
 
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
well uh okay uh Pam Ian is in the house
 
00:24:56.669 --> 00:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
uh a friend from conquered uh Pam has
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
submitted by the way uh thank you for
 
00:24:59.549 --> 00:24:59.559 align:start position:0%
the written
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
testimony um that's always appreciated
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
and we also have uh online submissions
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
for testimony and also to uh weigh in on
 
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
whether you support or don't support a
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
measure Pam's asked for up to five
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
minutes without read uh we we can read
 
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh and I look forward to I've already
 
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
looked at some of this um so if you can
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
summarize uh in the best way uh Pam the
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
wonderful written testimony that we have
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
on okay thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm not going
 
00:25:39.269 --> 00:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
to read that document to you guys I did
 
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
submit it because uh I was told that you
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
would rather hear about personal things
 
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
how the federal government has come down
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
on me for certain things but being a
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
constitutionalist I couldn't resist not
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
pointing out where the government over
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
the years since the 20th century has
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
violated that Constitution and it's I
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
know I know some of you probably don't
 
00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
like this um amendment that that it was
 
00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:08.919 align:start position:0%
put forth but I really hope that you'll
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
read what I have to say excuse me
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
because uh these are things that have
 
00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:15.799 align:start position:0%
happened over the year and it's almost
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
like the proverbial frog in the lukewarm
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
water you you slowly heat it up and
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
after a while the frog is going to die
 
00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what's happened to us
 
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
is that over the years these things have
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
happened and not enough people have come
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
forward and said hey you can't do that
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
or the Supreme Court has ruled
 
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
erroneously and we've seen this many
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
times where the Supreme Court decisions
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
were wrong but anyway um my name is
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
Pamela Ian I'm a resident of conquered
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
and I strongly support this referendum
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
this is something that needs to be on
 
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
the table we have to let the federal
 
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
government know that it has gone too far
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
and has overstepped its bounds in many
 
00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
areas and if you see once you read my
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
document you'll see that many of these
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
things happened years ago I'm not even
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
talking about things that have happened
 
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
since Obama or um Trump was in in
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
office I provided each of you with a
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
handout that explains how the government
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
has violated the Constitution over the
 
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
years the Constitution is the compact
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
between the people and the government
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
and when that document is violated
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
government has become arbitrary and
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's not what our Founders wanted for
 
00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
us so now I'll tell you about the
 
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.710 align:start position:0%
us so now I'll tell you about the
personal

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
story I was a a public school teacher
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
for about 23 years in this state and
 
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
after about 10 years the teachers union
 
00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
informed me that they would start
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
charging me an agency fee and which came
 
00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
out to about
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
$400 even though I was not a member of
 
00:27:55.279 --> 00:27:56.509 align:start position:0%
$400 even though I was not a member of
the

00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:59.789 --> 00:27:59.799 align:start position:0%
Union authorization for this came from
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
federal collective bargaining rules and
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
a Supreme Court decision in
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
1977 Abu versus the Detroit Board of
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
Education which allowed public employees
 
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
to require I mean public employers to
 
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
require non-union members in Union
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
represented bargaining un units to pay
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
an agency fee also known as fair
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
share I fought against this and I did
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
win on religious
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
grounds instead of my $400 going to the
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
union I could give it to a charity and
 
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200 align:start position:0%
that was what I was told I had to do so
 
00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
I chose St Vincent to Paul I'm religious
 
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
I go to church St Vincent to Paul is
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
something that my Parish uh participates
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
in now St Vincent to Paul is an
 
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
organization that feeds the poor and
 
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.039 align:start position:0%
those on the edge of
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
poverty I was told by the union lawyer
 
00:29:00.269 --> 00:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
that this was unconstitutional for me to
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
give my money to a religious
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
organization now I hope you see the
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
absurdity in that I won on the grounds
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
of being a religious person and yet I
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
was told oh you can't give your money to
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
a religious
 
00:29:14.909 --> 00:29:14.919 align:start position:0%
organization he said it was
 
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional it's not if once you
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
read my document you'll see um what the
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
founders meant by the First Amendment
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
freedom of
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:31.470 align:start position:0%
freedom of
religion

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
okay so once the Janice decision came
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
along in
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
2018 um it became a moot point anyone
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
who belonged to a public Union was no
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
longer required to pay this agency fee
 
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
however there's still private
 
00:29:49.149 --> 00:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
organizations uh unions that are taking
 
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
money from people and what I find
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
strange about that is when I did um
 
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of right to work one of
 
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:02.519 align:start position:0%
the um State reps asked me said well uh
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
you have you are covered by the Union by
 
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
law by federal law if something happened
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
if I did something wrong they would
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
support me and I said well first of all
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
I think that's absurd because I'm not a
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
union member so there's the first wrong
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
then the second wrong is that they could
 
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
take my money even though I was not part
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
of the Union so as you can see this this
 
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
is absurd you know one two wrongs don't
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
make a
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
right now in conclusion it's imperative
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
to understand that by supporting CAC R20
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
you are not saying that you support
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
independence from the United States but
 
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
rather that you are giving the voters
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
the right to decide if it's something
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
that they would support or
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
not please remember that this bill is
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
not about Trump or Biden in fact all of
 
00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
the things that I pointed out in here
 
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
happened before they were president in
 
00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
fact some of them happened before they
 
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
were even born and this is not a
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
Republican versus Democrat thing anyway
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
we're all Americans and all of our
 
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
freedoms are being um taken away by the
 
00:31:09.399 --> 00:31:11.710 align:start position:0%
freedoms are being um taken away by the
federal

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
government and the fact that our
 
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
Founders vision of peace prosperity and
 
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
freedom have come under under attack
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
should influence all of us and should
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
get up our our anger about it because
 
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
we're losing what our Founders had in
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
mind for us thank
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
you thank you Pam and thank you for the
 
00:31:33.389 --> 00:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
written testimony much appreciated if

there are no pressing questions we will
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
press on uh thank you again uh I'm
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%

recognize a fren she asked for three
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you honorable chair and

here my name is Carla Garrick I'm the
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
the chairwoman and president emiritus of
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
the free state project a movement that
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
is concentrating tens of thousands of
 
00:32:06.029 --> 00:32:06.039 align:start position:0%
Liberty lovers in the state of New
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm a naturalized US citizen
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
I'm originally from South Africa and I'm
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
an author activist and attorney I was
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
the Republican nominee for the New
 
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Senate in District 20 and I
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
received 46% of the vote in 2020 as an
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
open secessionist and in 2022 I ran for
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state house in Ward 11
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
in Manchester where I live and I lost by
 
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
about 200 votes I'm pointing that out
 
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
just to let you guys know this idea
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
might be a little more popular than you
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
assume I'm a proud Granite stator
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
because I chose New Hampshire as my
 
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
forever home about 15 years ago when I
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
moved here and I moved here for the Live
 
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
Free or Die ethos that we all love and
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
respect I'm testifying today in support
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
of cacr 20 which is similar to last
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
year's CAC
 
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
cr32 that was the original Independence
 
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
bill that we put fourth and we tried to
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
listen to the feedback we heard back and
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
that is the reason we brought this bill
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
back with a qualifying event what is
 
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
that qualifying event it is saying if
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
our national debt becomes 40 trillion
 
00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:25.240 align:start position:0%
dollar then maybe we need to do
 
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
something about it now I wants us to
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
stand still with the number of trillions
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure if anyone even
 
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
fully grasp and understands what is
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
going on economically and the way I
 
00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
would like to explain it is by
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
explaining numbers through time so a
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
million seconds is 11 and a half days a
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
billion seconds is 32 days and a
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
trillion seconds is
 
00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:03.029 align:start position:0%
trillion seconds is
31,000

00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
31,000
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
years so again when the jump went from
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
billions to trillions and we all just
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
kind of rolled with that we have to
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
realize when we are talking about the
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
debt and we are talking about trillions
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
of dollars this is not surmountable we
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
have to do something the federal
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
government has am I too loud was that
 
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
what you were saying oh sorry
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
Larry I can't hear from here sorry uh
 
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
the federal government has failed us it
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
no longer follows the Constitution it
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
ushers in unconstitutional Wars
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
Undeclared Wars it ushers in inflation
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's devalued our money by almost
 
00:34:52.349 --> 00:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
100% if you feel like you're getting
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
poorer you are if you feel like you
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
cannot get ahead and life anymore and
 
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
you know all of us here maybe on the
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
older side but talk to the young people
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
and realize we have to do
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
something um we are getting poorer and
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
the fault lies squarely with a federal
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
government's monetary policies I would
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
also like to point out we all lived
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
through covid Mania and if anyone thinks
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
what happened over the past three years
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
is an acceptable way for us to be
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
governed then I think we should look at
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
that as well Granite Staters are frankly
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
we're being abused by the federal
 
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
government and what do we advise people
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
when they are being abused to do we say
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
leave your
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
abuser the last time I spoke on this
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
issue here I talked a little bit about
 
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:45.640 align:start position:0%
National divorce since then that's
 
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
actually a topic that is starting to
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
come up you see it trending you see
 
00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:52.839 align:start position:0%
Congress people talking about it um I
 
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
want you to understand the people who
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
support National divorce do not support
 
00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
Civil War because the thing that you're
 
00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
are now seeing trend is people are
 
00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
talking about National divorce and then
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
the next thing you see is people are
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
talking about war in the same way the
 
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
question immediately came up we do not
 
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
support violence in fact we are here
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
today and we continue to work on this
 
00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
issue because violence is the tool of
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
tyrants it is the tool of authoritarians
 
00:36:28.829 --> 00:36:28.839 align:start position:0%
and it's the tool of control freaks in
 
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
other words it's the tool of the federal
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
government and bad people who support
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
killing other people because you
 
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
disagree with us instead of telling us
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
you'll punch Us in the face or leave us
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
to rot in a basement when we try to
 
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
leave we should start to have this open
 
00:36:50.349 --> 00:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
and honest conversation about what
 
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
actually needs to take place we have the
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
right to ask for a
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
divorce this is all today's proposed
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
Bill does it says it gives us Granite
 
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
Staters the Democratic opportunity to
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
decide if we want to stay with the
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
sinking ship of the federal government
 
00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
and its $40 trillion of federal debt or
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
if we can do better as Granite
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
Staters I believe we can do better on
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
our own um so abusers will tell you
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to leave they'll tell
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
you hey we'll change maybe like if you
 
00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
put in some bills and whistles we'll
 
00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
start to listen to the Constitution they
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
might even tell you it's your fault but
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
we all know the definition of insanity
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
is doing the same thing over and over
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
and gain it is insane for us to continue
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
to trust our government it's creating
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
debt imagine if you ran your household
 
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
the way they're running the government I
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
mean it's
 
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
absurd as our elected officials it's
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
your duty to create the opport
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for granite Staters to make
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
this decision for themselves you guys
 
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
don't really have the right to be the
 
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper on this all you should do is
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
say I don't know maybe we should leave
 
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
it up to the voters of New Hampshire um
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
and let us decide our own destiny we
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
have the right enshrined in the New
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution as has been
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned here both article 7 and
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
article 10 to make those decisions and
 
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
again clearly we're not here because we
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
want to revolt even though that right
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
exists we are here because we're trying
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
to solve a problem before it gets worse
 
00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
today your duty is to support democracy
 
00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
if you've tweeted the word democracy
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
ever if you've written about it if
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned it then this is your
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
Democratic duty is to put the question
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
to the voters of the Granite State we're
 
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
called To Live Free or Die State when we
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
become independent we will be the live
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
free and Thrive State and the the
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
questions that we have about what it
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
would look like how it would work we're
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
trying to address that too HB 1130 which
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
is coming up later as a study committee
 
00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
to start to talk about those questions
 
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
but I advise everyone let's not think in
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
a limited boxed way let's think with a
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
growth mindset and let's not have
 
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:18.680 align:start position:0%
limiting beliefs I can assure you that
 
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
if New Hampshire was independent we'd be
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
a cool little country and we could make
 
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
it work I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
are there any questions at this
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.109 --> 00:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
Mela thank you for taking my question um
 
00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
would you be in favor of an article 5
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
convention which could address the
 
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.510 align:start position:0%
convention which could address the
national

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
national
 
00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
de I mean yes I'm actually in favor of
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
anything where we're all talking and
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
we're actually trying to come up with
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
Solutions so I'm not against that
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
sure other
 
00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.030 align:start position:0%
sure other
questions

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:39:58.750 --> 00:39:58.760 align:start position:0%

welcome mat Matt's asked for up to three
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
minutes hey uh good morning chairman
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
Moffett and members of the committee my

name is Matt saborn D schaner I'm the
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
chairman of the New Hampshire
 
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
Independence political action committee
 
00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.359 align:start position:0%
we support legislators and help draft
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
legislation related to the idea of new
 
00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
as an independent country for the past 2
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
years in a row the St Amel poll has
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
registered the federal government
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
receiving a 75% disapproval rating in
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we'll see what this
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
Spring's poll will say we share the same
 
00:40:38.829 --> 00:40:38.839 align:start position:0%
feelings of dissatisfaction and
 
00:40:41.309 --> 00:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
uncertainty that many Grand Staters feel
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
regarding the future of the United
 
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
States for Grant Staters who have lost
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
confidence in DC we are proposing
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
another option we advocate for peaceful
 
00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
secession in the form of this year's CAC
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
R20 with a qualifier of 40 trillion in
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
debt if we hit it uh the current federal
 
00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
debt GDP ratio is
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
12229 and we believe New Hampshire can
 
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
do better than this while there's no
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
stand standard international legal
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
precedence for whether a seceding state
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
is required to accept its portion of the
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
federal debt when departing from its
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
parent State uh it would be smart to
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
plan for a course of action that
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
anticipates accepting our portion of the
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
national debt uh in the apportionment of
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
public debt and assets during state
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
published in case Western Reserve
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
Journal of international law provides
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
theories how debt could be shared
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
if we were to use New Hampshire's per
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
capita allocation which is around
 
00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:34.599 align:start position:0%
170,000 per per citizen or its
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of the national of the total
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
GDP which is
 
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
43% as a measuring stick to determining
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
H's portion it comes to an upper limit
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
of $172 billion I know Carla was talking
 
00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
about time
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
earlier uh if we were to pay if you were
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
to allocate the total tax burden that
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
was paid to the federal government in
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
2022 uh made that an annual payment to
 
00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
the any debt that we ac acred following
 
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
secession it could be paid off in just
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
over a decade it's just a thought uh
 
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
2024 is not the first time Americans
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
living in New England explored leaving
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
the Union New Hampshire or New England
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
states considered seceding in 1803 over
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
disputes with the Louisiana Purchase and
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%

federal government support of slavery
 
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
there is historical precedence for the
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
deliberations we are bringing forth
 
00:42:38.549 --> 00:42:38.559 align:start position:0%
today uh this month we do have

inspiring hope in some however we' seen

this play out year after year the
 
00:42:46.549 --> 00:42:46.559 align:start position:0%
political situation in the country has
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
only worsened in my lifetime I do not
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
anticipate it improving following
 
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
peaceful seccession we'd love to have
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
great relationships with our New England

asked for uh a couple minutes uh and
 
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
Bailey thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
esteemed committee members
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
uh I would preface it by saying a few
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
years ago I attended a a civil case of a
 
00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
of a land owner versus the one of the
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
towns it was here in concrete I believe
 
00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:09.589 align:start position:0%
towns it was here in concrete I believe
the

00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
trial and the person was representing
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
themselves proos say and they expressed
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
everything in terms of the New Hampshire
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution and at every step in like
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
an hour trial the judge would take
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
whatever the defendant said or the
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
plaintiff or whatever and translated
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
into the US
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution you know
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
everything this is an in a New Hampshire
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
Court over overseen by a New Hampshire
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
judge appointed under the New Hampshire
 
00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:42.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution had little interest in the
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution it was all
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
being translated to the US
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution so several years later I
 
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
attended the
 
00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
debates of this prior term this same
 
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
issue on the prior term this
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
and there was a pi that
 
00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
asked are we a sovereign state or just
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
the district office of
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
DC well by what I saw in that courtroom
 
00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
I'd say we were just the district office
 
00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:12.630 align:start position:0%
I'd say we were just the district office
for

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
DC which you can take that as you
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
like one of the
 
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
speeches said that this was all settled
 
00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
by the Civil
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
War as if we were a conquered people or
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
something I didn't quite get that but uh
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
most of the people around here fought
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
against the sueding States you know but
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
somehow or other we can never think of
 
00:45:39.309 --> 00:45:39.319 align:start position:0%
that we can never do
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
that because we're like a conquered
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
people I I don't believe we
 
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:49.800 align:start position:0%
are um we've seen positive examples of
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
this and the the British pulled out of
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
the European Union in
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
brexit I've I've lived through through
 
00:45:59.309 --> 00:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
several Quebec Independence votes and
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico Independence votes and
 
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
there's countries around the world that
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
have successfully and peacefully
 
00:46:08.069 --> 00:46:08.079 align:start position:0%
withdrawn from their larger
 
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
unit um I believe we could do the
 
00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
same but there's the counterveiling
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
thing that there's places that are
 
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
conquered like if to take this this
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative that was speaking and
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
said it was settled by the Civil War if
 
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
Putin manages to crush Ukraine will we
 
00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
all regard that as settled it could
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
never be brought up
 
00:46:34.829 --> 00:46:34.839 align:start position:0%
again or by the same token if if the
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
Chinese stomp into Taiwan will we and
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
success successfully oppress them will
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
we regard that as
 
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
settled I don't believe that this is
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
settled by the Civil
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
War we retain the right to pull out if
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
we want
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
voluntary um as far as the dollar goes I
 
00:46:55.599 --> 00:46:56.430 align:start position:0%
voluntary um as far as the dollar goes I
mean

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:46:58.150 --> 00:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
usually by this point the international
 
00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
monetary fund has been called in to
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
save whatever country is in the fix
 
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
we're in of course we're funding most of
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
that but
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh and I believe I one of the prior
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
Witnesses said we're at 129% of GDP to
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
Deb debt to
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
GDP they usually say that when you reach
 
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
when the debt equals GDP you will never
 
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
be able to pay it off you're already
 
00:47:27.549 --> 00:47:27.559 align:start position:0%
done you're doomed it's just a question
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
of when it
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
fails but that ratio is impossible to
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
ever pay off despite what they say and I
 
00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
don't mean to pick on the current
 
00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
Administration it's been going on for
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
years in a bipartisan
 
00:47:44.109 --> 00:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
way um we're constantly being asked to
 
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
this this at the county and the state
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
and even the town level to take Federal
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
money as grants well you know they
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
printed in the basement they have no
 
00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
money they're $34 trillion in debt that
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
it's magic you know it's not really
 
00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.270 align:start position:0%
it's magic you know it's not really
accomplishing

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
accomplishing
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
anything uh and just digging I'm I'm old
 
00:48:08.349 --> 00:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
but the younger people I see around me
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
we're digging them into debt from which
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
we will never
 
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
recover um so I would be in favor of at
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
least asking the people around me would
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
you like to get out of this
 
00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:23.270 align:start position:0%
you like to get out of this
mess

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
mess
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
peacefully thank you thank you
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any pressing
 
00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079 align:start position:0%

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative thank you again saying
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%

you um my name is Bonnie Freeman and I
 
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
heard somebody else say that you asked
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
specifically for personal reasons why we
 
00:49:02.589 --> 00:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
support this bill and I would like to
 
00:49:05.549 --> 00:49:05.559 align:start position:0%
say that as a kid I was I was a military
 
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
brat my dad and my mom met in the in the
 
00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
Army and my dad was in the military for
 
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
the entire time I was a child till I
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
moved out of the house and every
 
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
day watching him get up at 4:00 a.m. in
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
the morning work all day and I
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
constantly had to hear him say things
 
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
like I just can't get ahead I just I
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
don't have I don't have the ability to
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
have savings I just can't get ahead and
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
he is supposedly serving our country
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
people think that some people who' have
 
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:41.480 align:start position:0%
no idea think that military members make
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
like a whole bunch of money and they
 
00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.390 align:start position:0%
like a whole bunch of money and they
really

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:45.799 align:start position:0%
don't and um my mom had to take care of
 
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
the kids and there were seven of us well
 
00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
I then graduated high school and I
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't a rich person I didn't go to
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
college I just started working and I
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
found myself talking exactly like my dad
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
did my whole life I just can't catch a
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
break I can't get ahead how is it
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
possible that this cost this much and
 
00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
how's it possible I don't have any money
 
00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
left to put in savings well when I found
 
00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
out what inflation was that the
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
government had created this
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
invisible hidden tax that was stealing
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
the purchasing power of my money I was
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
so mad and I didn't even know what I
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
could possibly do about it I lived in
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
Utah at the time and I thought well I'll
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'll move to Texas cuz I'm pretty sure
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's the freest State and while I was
 
00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:33.079 align:start position:0%
there the government closed down
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
everything entertaining in your life or
 
00:50:38.589 --> 00:50:38.599 align:start position:0%
anything that made your life purposeful
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
and I had to walk past cops to go into
 
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
Walmart and stuff during covid well my
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
point is I I heard about New Hampshire
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
being much Freer came up here and
 
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
there's a large group of people who
 
00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:53.559 align:start position:0%
really care about personal freedoms here
 
00:50:55.789 --> 00:50:55.799 align:start position:0%
and I am happy to be a part of that
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
movement well I think that New Hampshire
 
00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a part of the federal
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
government because it's part of what has
 
00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
done all this terrible stuff to everyone
 
00:51:08.109 --> 00:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
I know who's a hardworking
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
person um stealing since Co began 50% of
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
our purchasing power the dollar still
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
looks the same but the dollar buys 50%
 
00:51:21.069 --> 00:51:21.079 align:start position:0%
less of what it did since Co started
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
because the federal government printed
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
that much money and it's just not fair
 
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
um the federal government also rated but
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
Bonnie thank you the comments you just
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
made on the on the money and the
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
currency we we've heard before and and
 
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
you did ask for a minute we have four
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
more cards and we uh want to give
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
everybody a shot at speaking to this and
 
00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799 align:start position:0%
so if you could uh conclude your
 
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
comments uh which we really appreciate
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
um but we want to give the other folks a
 
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
chance too before we finish up so so
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
continue okay well all I was going to
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
say was the Federal Government also raid
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
my house and I don't appreciate them um
 
00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
holding guns at at my face while I'm
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
naked and forc me to put my dog in some
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
a pile of glass and put a um boots on
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
that had glass filled in them and tried
 
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
to make me go outside naked in 10 degree
 
00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
weather and all because my boyfriend
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
didn't fill out a piece of paper and if
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
you want to learn more about that so
 
00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:18.109 align:start position:0%
you want to learn more about that so
cryptos

00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
cryptos
 
00:52:22.109 --> 00:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
6.com it's absolutely ridiculous that
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
everybody in Keen New Hampshire voted
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
against having these bear cats in the
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
federal government said this guy didn't
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
fill out a paperwork before selling
 
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin so we're going to go do that to
 
00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:32.839 align:start position:0%
the their house with Bearcats I don't
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%

Kean all right
 
00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:56.750 align:start position:0%
Kean all right
so

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire declared independence from
 
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
the British Empire and that was also
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
illegal I want to point out New
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire LED Independence for the
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
Americas in fact and it can do it again
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
if you recognize the United States or
 
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's prior declaration from
 
00:55:13.789 --> 00:55:13.799 align:start position:0%
Great Britain you must accept it would
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
be hypocritical to not also recognize
 
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
our right to declare it again against
 
00:55:21.549 --> 00:55:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
Empire there is a difference between
 
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:25.720 align:start position:0%
what is moral and right and what the law
 
00:55:27.549 --> 00:55:27.559 align:start position:0%
says we should do what is moral and
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
right not blindly do what the law says
 
00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:33.039 align:start position:0%
our veterans didn't fight our veterans
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
didn't fight to maintain a nation but
 
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
they did fight for liberty and freedom
 
00:55:40.829 --> 00:55:40.839 align:start position:0%
fear of war is a poor reason not to
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
declare independence New Hampshire is
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
not the one who would be declaring war
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
and this would not make sense after all
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
we're very small population we may be
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
invaded over our Declaration of
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
Independence and it might make sense to
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
fight back back but that is a poor
 
00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
reason to not declare
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
independence there's also a possibility
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
a war with New Hampshire doesn't unfold
 
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
at all it's a very
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
unpopular uh on right right now it's a
 
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.069 align:start position:0%
unpopular uh on right right now it's a
very

00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:11.079 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
unpopular uh to go to
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
war with any state that would break away
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's according to surveys the most
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
recent surveys
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
done um in regards to States declaring
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
independence from the United States so
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
basically any any president that were to
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
declare war on New Hampshire if it were
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
to declare independence would would be
 
00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
very very unpopular and most of the
 
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
population of the United States would be
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
against it the question is why
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
Independence though it no longer serves
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
our interests of our population to
 
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
continue in a union with the United
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
States besides the obvious Wars and
 
00:56:51.029 --> 00:56:51.039 align:start position:0%
other bad decisions I want to talk about
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
one reason we should go our own way the
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
US Supreme Court in South Dakota versus
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
Wayfair ruled that New Hampshire
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
businesses have to collect sales tax on
 
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
behalf of other states we don't even
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
have toare uh collect sales tax for our
 
00:57:04.829 --> 00:57:04.839 align:start position:0%
own State why should we have to declare
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
or collect sales tax for other states
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
this isn't the case for Canadian
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
businesses putting us at a
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
disadvantage the highest law of the land
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
applies to States not other
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
countries this is one good reason to
 
00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.069 align:start position:0%
countries this is one good reason to
declare

00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:20.079 align:start position:0%
declare
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
independence there are over 10,000
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
taxing jurisdictions and each has its
 
00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
own set of tax laws it's fiscally in
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
feasible and costly to figure out the
 
00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
taxes for each order a company ships
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
that's what Wayfair did there is not a
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
single business in compliance with this
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
ruling there are wrongly collected
 
00:57:40.589 --> 00:57:40.599 align:start position:0%
amounts because unlike a single business
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
in a single location complying with a
 
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:45.160 align:start position:0%
single set of tax laws the tax laws you
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
must comply with as a
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
business are dependent on the receiver's
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
location not even Europe has a tax
 
00:57:55.789 --> 00:57:55.799 align:start position:0%
system that's insane
 
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
we can't fix this and other bad
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
decisions without exiting the union this
 
00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
is just one of thousands of bad laws the
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme and Supreme Court rulings we
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
can't fix without declaring
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
independence New Hampshire isn't
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
declaring war on the United States it's
 
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
declaring independence from a union that
 
00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:15.039 align:start position:0%
no longer represents our interests
 
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
another example of why New Hampshire is
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
poorer than it should be is hidden
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
Federal taxation besides property taxes
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
federal income taxes and other federal
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
taxes you see removed from your paycheck
 
00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
or on your pay stub it there's also
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
other taxes like tariffs for example I
 
00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
paid 25% tariff to receive some 4G USB
 
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
modems for my business that we sell um
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
and as an a rough estimate of what
 
00:58:41.069 --> 00:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
that's taking out of your paycheck or
 
00:58:43.029 --> 00:58:43.039 align:start position:0%
out of your income that's about 133% if
 
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
you're talking about Goods across
 
00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
there's not tariffs on every good but
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's about 13% if you look at uh all
 
00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
of Walmart all the goods in Walmart it's
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
about 13% they're basically the federal
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
government's getting from you and in a
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
form of tax a hidden tax um and those
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
are called
 
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
tariffs um some estimates put the amount
 
00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
stolen by government through these means
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
and other regulations at
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
90% so think about that almost double
 
00:59:09.309 --> 00:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
your income no matter what we lose from
 
00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:11.559 align:start position:0%
federal bribes they can be made up
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
through local means whether it's taxes
 
00:59:17.549 --> 00:59:17.559 align:start position:0%
or other other systems of uh fundraising
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
okay CH we we've heard a lot of the
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
numbers material before and I know
 
00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
you're reading some some testimony and
 
00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
we're running a little behind you're a
 
00:59:29.309 --> 00:59:29.319 align:start position:0%
little bit over so I I'm done so oh okay
 
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh that that was that was a good finish
 
00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:33.640 align:start position:0%
are there any pressing questions for for
 
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%

District budget committee um the first
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to talk about was an
 
01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
article that was published in 2007 in
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
the Journal of Homeland Security and
 
01:00:31.839 --> 01:00:32.990 align:start position:0%
the Journal of Homeland Security and
Emergency

01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
Emergency
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
Management the title of this article was
 
01:00:39.029 --> 01:00:39.039 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security and community policing
 
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
competing or complimenting Public Safety
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
policies this article was co-authored by
 
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
two different people the first was Dr
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
Robert freedan Dr Robert Freedman is the
 
01:00:54.510 --> 01:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
founding director of the Georgia
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
international law enforcement exchange
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
this program has police Chiefs and
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
assistant Chiefs and high ranking
 
01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:04.839 align:start position:0%
officers throughout the nation spend
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
time in Israel uh working with their
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
police force and to summarize they
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
essentially learn how to police in a
 
01:01:17.029 --> 01:01:17.039 align:start position:0%
system of apartheid a Us and Them type
 
01:01:17.039 --> 01:01:18.349 align:start position:0%
system of apartheid a Us and Them type
of

01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
society the other author was a man named
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
William Jordan Cannon which was my name
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
before I changed it I have the document
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
of my name change if you need to see
 
01:01:34.109 --> 01:01:34.119 align:start position:0%
that Dr fredman was my mentor and um I
 
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
learned a lot from him and I'll
 
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:38.440 align:start position:0%
summarize the article that I'm
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
mentioning on one
 
01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:44.839 align:start position:0%
hand Homeland Security and the Patriot
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
Act created a system where there was an
 
01:01:49.950 --> 01:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
Us and Them society as far as policing
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
and Public Safety goes this is the
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
opposite of what community community
 
01:01:57.549 --> 01:01:57.559 align:start position:0%
policing does community policing engages
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
the community it works within it does
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
not see criminals or people who are you
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
know engaging in any type of behavior as
 
01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.390 align:start position:0%
know engaging in any type of behavior as
the

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
other what I believe that the people
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
here who are in support of secession
 
01:02:14.670 --> 01:02:14.680 align:start position:0%
which I agree with many of their
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
sentiments um all the statements about
 
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
the present state of the federal
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
government I'm in agreement with but I
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
think that their thoughts of secession
 
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
is similar to grasping at a phantom limb
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
because there is an idea of America that
 
01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
I think we all have that is no longer in
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
practice now whether This was um negated
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
by the Patriot Act or if it was negated
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
by the recent covid legislation I don't
 
01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
by the recent covid legislation I don't
know

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
but with the
 
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
covid legislation and all the things
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
that happened there we ended up with a
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
society again of two different masked
 
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
people unmasked people vaccinated people
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated people and as we all can
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
probably agree upon A House Divided A
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
House Divided cannot stand and that's
 
01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
what I think is going to happen so what
 
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
I did after the uh Hearing in 2022 cacr
 
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
32 um is I went and visited various uh
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
select boards up and down the
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River um and discussed
 
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
something that I created called the
 
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River 8 project this is not
 
01:03:30.029 --> 01:03:30.039 align:start position:0%
a revolutionary idea this is not a
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
secession idea this is something to do
 
01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:35.839 align:start position:0%
once the collapse happens because most
 
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
people are going to go along with
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
whatever is in place until it no until
 
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
it ceases to function at least that is
 
01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
what I believe
 
01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.349 align:start position:0%
what I believe
um

01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
the the frustrating thing with being on
 
01:03:52.349 --> 01:03:52.359 align:start position:0%
a budget committee for a school district
 
01:03:54.029 --> 01:03:54.039 align:start position:0%
especially with Esser funding I'm not
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
sure sure if anyone of you familiar with
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
Federal funding for schools during Co
 
01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
and now a lot of these positions are
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
going it's when I'm seeing Federal money
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
being sent to Ukraine or to Israel or to
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
wherever and when I see schools lose
 
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
teachers it makes me a little bit
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
frustrated and concerned that the people
 
01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
in DC do not care about the people of
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
the United States of America so I don't
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
think necessarily it is a problem with
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
America because I I travel all around
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
this country I actually even work in
 
01:04:30.029 --> 01:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
Buckland mass as a board's clerk I think
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
probably the problem is Washington DC
 
01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:34.839 align:start position:0%
and the all the alphabet organizations
 
01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
that exist there so what I would ask
 
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
everyone here to consider
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
is that even though secession would be
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
great and being from Atlanta of course I
 
01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
can talk about that I think if we look
 
01:04:51.029 --> 01:04:51.039 align:start position:0%
see what happened the last time session
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
it was a group of people looking to hold
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
on to something that was already gone
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
the American re the uh Confederate
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
secession was about holding on to
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
feudalism where we were moving towards
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
industrialization and technology and I
 
01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
think what this session is is trying to
 
01:05:10.150 --> 01:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
hold on to a 20th century America that
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
does not exist anymore and it saddens me
 
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
that that's the case I'll take any
 
01:05:16.269 --> 01:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
questions if you have
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
any I there any pressing
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes so are you in support
 
01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.910 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes so are you in support
or

01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
opposition are you in support or
 
01:05:29.029 --> 01:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill or you take no
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
stance you support this measure correct
 
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm neutral to it because I and if I
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
can explain why the what we're way over
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
your your minutes
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh and I want to honor the other folks
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
who've come here and and uh so we'll
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
bark you down as neutral and thank you
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
for coming here from Al allad and that
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
was very uh well organized nice
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for that thank you
 
01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh Elliot uh the last card I he is
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
for Elliot axelman is Elliot
 
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
here um and and there he is he's been
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
here before uh and before ell he's the
 
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
last card that I have if there's anyone
 
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
else here who thought they put a card
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
and wanted to speak I want to honor your
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
time we've gone way over what we planned
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
on this but uh obviously we care about
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
what you want to say about this so we'll
 
01:06:28.910 --> 01:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
finish up here uh Elliot uh if you have
 
01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
anything anything new that's what we
 
01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
want to hear is new stuff and you have a
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
couple minutes sure well lucky for me I
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
didn't hear any of the previous
 
01:06:37.589 --> 01:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
testimony but I'll try not to repeat
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
everything um I only have like 34
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
trillion reasons why I want to leave the
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
union so this might not take you too
 
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
many more decades to listen to me um
 
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
there are so many reasons I think the
 
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
the overarching things a lot of people
 
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:51.480 align:start position:0%
touched on the inflation the other stuff
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
the Wars all the violations um just
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
inflation in of itself is enough reason
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
to want to leave the union um for me the
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
biggest things are probably the endless
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
Wars forcing me so I have to pay taxes I
 
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
pay about a quarter third of my income
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
to federal taxes and that goes to
 
01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
fighting Wars in 100 180 countries
 
01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
around the world um bombing people and
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
as we now know it's it's not even
 
01:07:14.589 --> 01:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
controversial to say that the federal
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
government with our taxpayer dollars is
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
funding both sides of so many wars they
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
are giving billions to Israel and uh
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
Gaza the PA or or Iran Hezbollah and uh
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
Hamas like they're funding both sides
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
they're funding both sides of other Wars
 
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
probably Ukraine probably Russia
 
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
probably other sides of uh uh Middle
 
01:07:33.789 --> 01:07:33.799 align:start position:0%
Eastern count so they're funding both
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
sides and and uh with our taxpayer
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
dollars um but the biggest things for me
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
is we have not had a chance so people in
 
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
this room alive today have not had a
 
01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
chance to vote on whether we want to
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
stay in this relationship with the DC
 
01:07:50.829 --> 01:07:50.839 align:start position:0%
politicians in like 250 years so even if
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
in some Universe in which our ancestors
 
01:07:55.309 --> 01:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
we had direct lineage to Thomas
 
01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:56.839 align:start position:0%
Jefferson and George Washington which
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
most of us don't but even if we had
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
Direct lineage what we have is our
 
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
ancestors 250 years ago so like 25
 
01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
Generations back um not all of them but
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
some of them signed onto the
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution only like 40 of them but
 
01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
whatever um but even if all of that
 
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
signed the Constitution unanimously all
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
1 million American col colonists uh that
 
01:08:18.789 --> 01:08:18.799 align:start position:0%
still couldn't bind all of us to be in a
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
Perpetual relationship with our
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
overlords and DC Forever um I my son
 
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
over there I could I can't really bind
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
him to anything I barely have like
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
guardianship over him but my grandson I
 
01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
can't bind to anything I can't sign a
 
01:08:33.269 --> 01:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
contract that any law legal system in
 
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
the universe that I know of would be
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
considered legitimate to bind my son or
 
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
grandson or great-grandson to any kind
 
01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
of contract especially not uh being a
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
slave to the people in DC Forever um so
 
01:08:46.349 --> 01:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
if you think of it as as a marriage you
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
know in the modern era we have uh
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
unilateral divorce if one party wants to
 
01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
leave you know it takes two I think um
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
the Shay said last time you can't just
 
01:08:57.149 --> 01:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
leave you know it takes two to enter
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
relationship it takes two to leave
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's you know kind of not really how
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
the world Works um one it takes two to
 
01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
enter relationship but one is enough to
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
leave if you know my wife wants to
 
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
divorce me she could do that I can't use
 
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
Force so if we want to leave DC uh we
 
01:09:13.110 --> 01:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't need DC's consent to do it um
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
we can just leave if we're being abused
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
so I I've written articles everyone on
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
the committee knows I've written
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
numerous articles and books and and um
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
put out a lot of stuff about the reasons
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
there are hundreds of reasons I have an
 
01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
article running tally of like 130
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
reasons why we should succeed um I'm
 
01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
happy to give a lot of material to the
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
committee today I wrote a short book
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
called articles of secession that
 
01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
answers all the most common questions
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
I'd love to debate I'd love to have a
 
01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
study committee as well but I'd love to
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
put this on the ballot um and one last
 
01:09:42.269 --> 01:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
thing is it says 35 trillion we're we or
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
40 trillion we that needs to put up like
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
45 50 trillion because we're running out
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
of time by the time we're done with this
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
bill and we execute in a few days maybe
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh it'll the debt will be past 40
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
trillion maybe so let's push up to 50
 
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
trillion to give us a bit more time but
 
01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
I think there are so many reasons and
 
01:09:58.830 --> 01:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
the people should be allowed to vote on
 
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
this um we have never had a chance in
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
250 years to vote on this and there are
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
so many reasons I could go on literally
 
01:10:07.149 --> 01:10:07.159 align:start position:0%
Forever Until I Die of old AG so I'll
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
stop it there I'm happy to take
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%

if yeah I'll be quick um I didn't

prepare a speech but I'm just going to
 
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
speak from my heart um our government
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
infiltrated um a long time ago and they
 
01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
are just merely puppets they answer to
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
the elite
 
01:11:45.149 --> 01:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
oligarchs and they don't serve the
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
American public at all They Don't Care
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
About Us like other people have said and
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
they do um I had so much more to say in
 
01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
my head but but I feel Under Pressure um
 
01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
but the lobbyists they're they're bribed
 
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
they're blackmailed um they don't they
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
don't serveice any any any longer and we
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
are headed towards a
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
dystopian um digital future with uh
 
01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.310 align:start position:0%
dystopian um digital future with uh
digital

01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
digital
 
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
IDs Central Bank digital
 
01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:19.719 align:start position:0%
currencies and social economic score um
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
you can see it coming you really can see
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
it coming I don't know you can even feel
 
01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
it coming but um imagine what we could
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
do if we were were we were to be able to
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
seced we could create free energy it has
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
been done and and but they hide
 
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
everything they don't allow us to do
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
something like that we could in fact
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
Stanley Meyer back in the 70s I don't
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
know you remember but he was on TV on
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
the news and everything he was able to
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
create a car that could run on water and
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
the feds ended up murdering him got all
 
01:13:00.629 --> 01:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
of his technology and murdered him um
 
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
there's been Healers of cancer and um
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know using
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
frequencies and there they
 
01:13:10.639 --> 01:13:12.510 align:start position:0%
frequencies and there they
were

01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:13:15.629 --> 01:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
murdered um so imagine what we could do
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have those kind of
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
restraints we could really really
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
succeed very well um and that's I there
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
was a lot more I wanted to say but like
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
I said I know what times run
 
01:13:33.149 --> 01:13:33.159 align:start position:0%

01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
um uh I want to thank Christina Dyer
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
Christina you're uh I did she is our
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
researcher and come to find out uh a
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
measure similar to this came to the
 
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
house to this committee uh around 2011
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
or so so this is not the first time this
 
01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
has come here and um we're going to look
 
01:14:37.709 --> 01:14:37.719 align:start position:0%
at what came before I've looked at some
 
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
of the notes Christina put together very
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
interesting that this has come up before
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh before we get started I I want to say
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
a couple things uh we're going to do
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
this a little bit differently uh
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
repesent Gart is the prime sponsor uh
 
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
he's asked asked if he could go last uh
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
to briefly tie tie up any loose ends in
 
01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
terms of testimony so the co-sponsor
 
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
representative Granger is going to
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
introduce the measure uh before I throw
 
01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
it to representative Granger um I want
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge is very important to me
 
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
and I've already spoken to some of these
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
gentlemen there this this measure is
 
01:15:17.709 --> 01:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
about the uh incident that happened in
 
01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:21.320 align:start position:0%
1967 uh I was around then I was a kid
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
but I remember this this incident
 
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:25.400 align:start position:0%
happening this incident if that's the
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
right word uh and there are at least
 
01:15:29.310 --> 01:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
three gentlemen uh who have already
 
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
spoken to earlier who have traveled
 
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
great distances to be here to talk about
 
01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
uh this the the ten of the bill the the
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh the two Representatives will will do
 
01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
that um I want to point out that there
 
01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
will be a news conference or a press
 
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
conference news conference uh scheduled
 
01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
for 11:30 down in the L the Legislative
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
Office Building
 
01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
Lobby um and I and I appreciate the the
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh taking my councel to set
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
this up downstairs we have a finite
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
amount of time in here and it's very
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
important that these gentlemen who
 
01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
traveled a great distance have a chance
 
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
to uh say some things that they feel
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
need to be said and also to take some
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
questions so we'll do a little of that
 
01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
in here but we we are constrained by
 
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
time so I want to point out that uh news
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
conference downstairs at 11:30 so all
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
that said we will get to the uh sponsor
 
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
and then um to uh some of the the
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
gentlemen who were part of this uh this
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
American history uh representative
 
01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
Granger uh welcome uh thank you uh thank
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair members of the committee
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is to establish a commission
 
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:40.760 align:start position:0%
to investigate the USS Liberty incident
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
there are many important reasons to form
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
this commission but rather than have me
 
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:45.320 align:start position:0%
speak to that that we have firsthand
 
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
Witnesses here uh who can fill you in I
 
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
I do want to point out that this bill
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
was submitted in September and therefore
 
01:16:54.629 --> 01:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
it was not instigated by the recent
 
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
occurrences in October so this isn't uh
 
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
a bill to draw any special attention to
 
01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
the uh issue of Israel at all and it's
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
not it's not political in that sense it

this is a bill to establish a commission
 
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
to investigate this
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
1967 uh naval battle in the
 
01:18:08.189 --> 01:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
Mediterranean so
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh Larry Larry Bowen who I spoke with
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
earlier I believe from Baltimore Larry
 
01:18:16.629 --> 01:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
welcome uh and we're very interested to
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:23.550 align:start position:0%
 
say

01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Larry Bowen uh back
 
01:18:32.070 --> 01:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
in June 8th 1967 I was an E5
 
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
Communications technician rman and uh
 
01:18:40.590 --> 01:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to support uh H HB 1041
 
01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
me i' I'd like to be you know called
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
under oath if possible because I uh have
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
never had an opportunity to speak before
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
a committee to uh you know tell the
 
01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
story that uh that the American public
 
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
needs to hear yes Larry the notion of uh
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
swearing you wi under under oath has
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
come up and I contacted and spoke with
 
01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
some parliamentarian types and we're we
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
are not going to uh do the oath taking
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
and I think as a military person uh my
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that you don't need to
 
01:19:27.149 --> 01:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
swear an oath we we believe what you're
 
01:19:29.709 --> 01:19:29.719 align:start position:0%
going to say without an oath so there
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
there you have it okay thank you well in
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
the previous bill I heard a lot about
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and what
 
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh what the Constitution and our
 
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
government is is not not
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
following um part of the reason that
 
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
we're here today is to support this bill
 
01:19:55.149 --> 01:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
that uh our our government failed in
 
01:19:58.590 --> 01:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
supporting the Constitution back when we
 
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
were attacked on June 8th
 
01:20:05.470 --> 01:20:05.480 align:start position:0%
1967 um the government failed to come to
 
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
our rescue the government put a gag
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
order on us to um you know not speak
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
about the the incident um and threatened
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
us with imprisonment and fines and the
 
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh the government failed to do a f
 
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:30.040 align:start position:0%
thorough investigation of the uh the
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
attack um the Navy conducted a Navy
 
01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
Court of
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
inquiry and during that court of inquiry
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
they took testimony from several of our
 
01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
Shipmates um but then they were given
 
01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
guidance to modify the testimony that
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
they received um so that
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
it would comply with the mistaken
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
identity uh claim that that Israel had
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
said when they
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh we were not all called for our
 
01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
testimony all of us uh the other two
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
gentlemen here with me today uh were in
 
01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
different parts of the ship so we've got
 
01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
a little different perspective on on
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
what happened and and why this bill is
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
so important to us we've we've waited 56
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
and a half years for something like this
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
giving us an opportunity to speak before
 
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
a government organization that may in
 
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
fact follow through because of your you
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
know Live Free or Die uh statement
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
that's what we're looking for we're
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
looking for the truth to get out about
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
the incident with the USS Liberty and
 
01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
the aftermath um the investigations that
 
01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
weren't done even though they were you
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
know constitutional requirement we
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
submitted a uh war crimes report back in
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
2005 that was designed to to have our
 
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
government do a formal investigation
 
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
uh through the Department of Defense and
 
01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
they replied that there had already been
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
an investigation conducted and that
 
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
there they weren't going to do another
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
one uh there's been no Congressional
 
01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
investigation into the Liberty this is
 
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
the first opportunity for a state to
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
actually come forth and say that you
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
know they're willing to set up a
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
commission to look into this and uh you
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
know report back on on the findings
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
there a lot of unanswered questions that
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh were submitted through uh the remote
 
01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
testimony process um and I won't go into
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh we're thrilled that the state of New
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is uh is willing to take this
 
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
up on the agenda and uh possibly give us
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
a chance to uh you know EXP express our
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
concerns and
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know get some truth out to the
 
01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.350 align:start position:0%
uh you know get some truth out to the
American

01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
American
 
01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
public thank you Larry and thank you for
 
01:23:35.629 --> 01:23:35.639 align:start position:0%
your service I I want to point out that
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh you folks have traveled great
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
distances there's also a New Hampshire
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
connection there's a commander David
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
Edward Edwin Lewis from colbrook North
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
Country where I'm from uh was on that
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
ship he might have been the the U um he
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
was Intel officer I think on our uh
 
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
officer in charge of the naval security
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
group activity that was also being
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
supported by the National Security
 
01:24:04.030 --> 01:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
Agency and uh and he passed away in 2021
 
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
at the age of 90 so there there is that
 
01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire connection and I believe
 
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
his niece is here and is going to talk
 
01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
to okay uh well we certainly look
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
forward to that and okay that would be
 
01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.470 align:start position:0%
forward to that and okay that would be
her

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
um it we we do need to roll and I know
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
you have a news conference coming up
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to have you miss
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
because then you'll have full
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity but I I have one quick
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
question uh that has to do with the end
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
state so the purpose of this measure is
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
to establish a commission so if if the
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
commission were to be established uh let
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
me ask you uh what if if you could
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
briefly tell us one thing that you'd
 
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
like to see come out of this commission
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
where it to happen
 
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
um probably
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
probably for me I'd like to see the
 
01:24:59.390 --> 01:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
truth come out so that we can we can
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
actually you know tell the rest of the
 
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
American public exactly what happened
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
there's still documentation that the NSA
 
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
and CIA are holding as classified
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
information that uh that they haven't
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
released yet there's uh still
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
documentation that uh has come out since
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
the June 8th
 
01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
1967 uh that's been published in various
 
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
books but um it's never all come
 
01:25:35.669 --> 01:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
together to kind of refute refute the uh
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
the claim that this was a mistaken
 
01:25:40.990 --> 01:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
identity attack and and was in fact a
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
deliberate attack so um yeah I'd like to
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
see the uh results of the committee to
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
to verify what uh what the actual cause
 
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
of the attack Act was and uh what what
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
we should have done that uh our Congress
 
01:25:58.639 --> 01:26:00.709 align:start position:0%
we should have done that uh our Congress
didn't

01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
do thank you for that questions any
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
other questions uh yes uh represent Lev
 
01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
Mett you know I appreciate your
 
01:26:14.550 --> 01:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
testimony it's Larry right
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
yes a question I have is where did the
 
01:26:21.070 --> 01:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
government failed I mean your testimony
 
01:26:24.109 --> 01:26:24.119 align:start position:0%
is rather vague I mean in what
 
01:26:24.119 --> 01:26:25.629 align:start position:0%
is rather vague I mean in what
unanswered

01:26:25.629 --> 01:26:25.639 align:start position:0%
unanswered
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
questions um need to be explained I mean
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
you're up here testimony I think the
 
01:26:33.870 --> 01:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
committee deserves an indepth
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
explanation as to why you feel that the
 
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
government failed and according to my
 
01:26:43.149 --> 01:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
memorandum here it says uh the official
 
01:26:46.350 --> 01:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
report states that the attack was
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
accidental I mean I think in order for
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
us to make a informative decision
 
01:26:54.990 --> 01:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
we would probably need a little better
 
01:26:56.990 --> 01:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
explanation as to why you don't believe
 
01:27:00.750 --> 01:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
that okay as a crew member uh we had
 
01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:01.550 align:start position:0%
that okay as a crew member uh we had
been

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:27:05.070 --> 01:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
overflown that day uh probably a half a
 
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
dozen times by Israeli aircraft doing
 
01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:12.280 align:start position:0%
reconnaissance on our ship and at the
 
01:27:16.470 --> 01:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
time we felt safe because the uh the
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
planes were clearly marked and uh we
 
01:27:22.950 --> 01:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
thought that you know they had our back
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
cuz we were out there as an independent
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
ship the
 
01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
guess when the attack occurred they were
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
using unmarked aircraft so we had no
 
01:27:38.910 --> 01:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
idea what uh what country was actually
 
01:27:42.189 --> 01:27:42.199 align:start position:0%
doing the you know the
 
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
attacking we uh we didn't find that out
 
01:27:47.709 --> 01:27:47.719 align:start position:0%
until the torpedo boats came up after
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
the strafing runs and the napom drops uh
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
the torpedo boats came in and they were
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
carrying the star David flags on their
 
01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
on their little torpedo boats
 
01:28:03.750 --> 01:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh where where our government failed is
 
01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
that they didn't take into
 
01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
consideration anything about the
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
culpability of uh of the attackers or
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
who was you know there was no discussion
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
with uh the
 
01:28:24.910 --> 01:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh Israeli Defense Force personnel who
 
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:28.400 align:start position:0%
were participating in this um it came
 
01:28:30.669 --> 01:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
out after the attack that there was
 
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
actually intercept voice intercept from
 
01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
the aircraft uh pilots and their ground
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
controllers that they did identify it as
 
01:28:45.109 --> 01:28:45.119 align:start position:0%
a us you know ship with uh the American
 
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
flag flying but that was taken out of
 
01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:49.590 align:start position:0%
flag flying but that was taken out of
the

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
testimony so so when they Court of
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
inquiry was done the uh some of the
 
01:29:00.189 --> 01:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
things that were you
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
know I guess some of the things that
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
happened to the ship were uh were not
 
01:29:08.590 --> 01:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to be testified about uh we
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
hadeen follow up followup chair follow
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
up it's astonishing to me that
 
01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
this wasn't discredited by our
 
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
government because what you're saying is
 
01:29:24.189 --> 01:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
going open up a whole new
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
investigation because of a testimony
 
01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.510 align:start position:0%
investigation because of a testimony
that

01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
and forgive me if I wrong that was not
 
01:29:34.750 --> 01:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
investigated because if if what you're
 
01:29:37.629 --> 01:29:37.639 align:start position:0%
saying it wasn't I mean you know that
 
01:29:40.350 --> 01:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
could have you know
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
long-term implications as far as where
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
this committee not only goes of votes
 
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
but you know in some of the U decisions
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
the government may have to make right
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
well I understand and it's uh those are
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
the kinds of questions that came up with
 
01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
with us as a organization trying to get
 
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
Congress to uh to do a full and
 
01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.149 align:start position:0%
Congress to uh to do a full and
comprehensive

01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
investigation um this bill if the
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
committee you know so chooses um
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
establishes a commission to do
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
the the work of the federal government
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
um to determine not only culpability but
 
01:30:32.669 --> 01:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
um answer questions about why we were
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know put under gag order to never
 
01:30:39.310 --> 01:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
talk about the the incident uh I mean it
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
was it was historical in the sense of
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Larry and you just mentioned
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
historical and I think one of the and I
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
think representative L's question is
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
very fair uh gets right to the heart of
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
what we need to talk about and I think
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
your answer is very good uh we need to
 
01:30:58.590 --> 01:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
press on uh you mentioned historical and
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
I think one thing that'll come out of
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
this uh this is on YouTube um a lot of
 
01:31:05.709 --> 01:31:05.719 align:start position:0%
awareness has been raised and is being
 
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
raised and will be raised about this
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
history from 1967 a lot of people did
 
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
not know about and they will know about
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
it now I don't know where this will go
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're still taking obviously
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
testimony um are there any other
 
01:31:22.270 --> 01:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
questions for Larry
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
at this time uh M Bowen thank you for
 
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.520 align:start position:0%

else who was there in
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
1967 uh and has come here all the way
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%

Marine Corps retired Baptist Minister
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
ordain I have some pictures here I would
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
like to provide to the members of the
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
committee Show the ship that was taken
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
from the aircraft of the USS America on
 
01:32:12.109 --> 01:32:12.119 align:start position:0%
the next morning there were also some
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
pictures that were taken of me the next
 
01:32:17.070 --> 01:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
morning I faced a torpedo explosion from
 
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
less than 10 ft away looking at it the
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
question came up about the identity of
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
the ship every protocol and
 
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
international law that was designed to
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
prevent such an accident was violated by
 
01:32:31.709 --> 01:32:31.719 align:start position:0%
the Israelis in this attack they were
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
using unmarked aircraft they were
 
01:32:36.109 --> 01:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
jamming our distress frequencies they
 
01:32:39.109 --> 01:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
machine guned our life rafts ironically
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
the machine gunning of the life rafts
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
international law came about as a result
 
01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
of Nazi submarines machine gunning
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
Refugee ships many of which contain
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
individuals who later became Israeli
 
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
citizens the question came up that we
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
were not in a combat zone the Israelis
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
never broadcasted an area closure
 
01:33:05.310 --> 01:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
therefore we were not in a combat zone
 
01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
we were at international waters 13 and a
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
half miles off the Sinai
 
01:33:13.229 --> 01:33:13.239 align:start position:0%
Peninsula there was no
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
investigation by the US Congress into
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
the attack ownership which is required
 
01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
by Article 1 section8 the US
 
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution to invest acts of piracy on
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
the high seas Congress has never done so
 
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
the Liberty vets Association has a
 
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
letter from the US Congress that that is
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
in the Congressional
 
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
Record some years ago the USS Cole was
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
attacked off Yemen 17 Americans were

Franklin I just wanted to address what
 
01:45:03.310 --> 01:45:03.320 align:start position:0%
happened immediately after the attack
 
01:45:06.669 --> 01:45:06.679 align:start position:0%
and the subsequent efforts to sync the
 
01:45:10.750 --> 01:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
Liberty just briefly yes we were sent uh
 
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
when hell filing got there 17 hours
 
01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:14.199 align:start position:0%
later and they took the most seriously
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
wounded off um which was most the
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
ship they sent us to Malta th000 miles
 
01:45:24.270 --> 01:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
away with a 40x40 foot torpedo hole in
 
01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
it hoping we'd sink on the way and all
 
01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:31.239 align:start position:0%

Boston there's some
 
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
highlighted aspects in there in June of
 
01:46:48.589 --> 01:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
1967 I was assigned a senior legal
 
01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
council for the Navy's Court of inquiry
 
01:46:51.910 --> 01:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
in to the brutal attack on USS Liberty
 
01:46:53.709 --> 01:46:53.719 align:start position:0%
which had occurred on June 8th the late
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
Admiral Isaac c kid president of the
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
court and I were given only one week to
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
gather evidence just I'm reading the
 
01:47:00.870 --> 01:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
highlighted Parts just go through this
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
very fastly it was our shared belief is
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
on the bottom based on a documentary
 
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
evidence and
 
01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
testimony we Reed firsthand that the
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
Israeli attack was planned and
 
01:47:10.589 --> 01:47:10.599 align:start position:0%
deliberate and could not possibly have
 
01:47:12.589 --> 01:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
been an accident Admiral kid and I both
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
felt it necessary to travel to Israel to
 
01:47:15.550 --> 01:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
interview the Israelis who took part in
 
01:47:17.629 --> 01:47:17.639 align:start position:0%
the attack Admiral kid L told me that
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
Admiral McCain was adamant that we were
 
01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:21.320 align:start position:0%
not to travel to is or contact the
 
01:47:23.589 --> 01:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
Israelis concerning this matter I know
 
01:47:24.990 --> 01:47:25.000 align:start position:0%
from personal conversations I had with
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
Admiral kid that President Lyndon
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
Johnson and Secretary of Defense robbert
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
mcnamar ordered him to conclude that the
 
01:47:32.270 --> 01:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
attack was a case of mistaken identity
 
01:47:33.709 --> 01:47:33.719 align:start position:0%
despite overwhelming evidence to the
 
01:47:35.629 --> 01:47:35.639 align:start position:0%
contrary Admiral kid told me after
 
01:47:37.229 --> 01:47:37.239 align:start position:0%
returning from Washington DC that he had
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
been ordered to sit down with two
 
01:47:40.589 --> 01:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
civilians from either the White House or
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
the defense department and rewrite
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
portions of the Court's findings Admiral
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
kid also told me that he had been
 
01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
ordered to quote unquote put the lid on
 
01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
everything having to do with the attack
 
01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:51.719 align:start position:0%
on USS Liberty we were never to speak of
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
it and we were to caution everyone else
 
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
involved that they could never speak of
 
01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:57.189 align:start position:0%
involved that they could never speak of
it

01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:47:59.790 --> 01:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
again and the first page we spoke
 
01:48:03.070 --> 01:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
briefly of Commander Lewis who is from C
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
Brook New Hampshire so I just want to
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
establish there is a
 
01:48:10.149 --> 01:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
very um significant New Hampshire
 
01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
connection to this Commander Lewis was
 
01:48:16.589 --> 01:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
in charge of I believe 194 men on board
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
the ship out of
 
01:48:19.239 --> 01:48:21.030 align:start position:0%
the ship out of
294

01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
294
 
01:48:25.229 --> 01:48:25.239 align:start position:0%
204 so he in his
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
page second paragraph well third
 
01:48:34.589 --> 01:48:34.599 align:start position:0%
technically Eddie's career spanned more
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.189 --> 01:48:42.199 align:start position:0%
commander and he was wounded aboard the
 
01:48:43.589 --> 01:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
USS Liberty in the Mediterranean Sea
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
when the nation of Israel attacked a
 
01:48:46.109 --> 01:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
ship claiming mistaken identification of
 
01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
the ship for the rest of his life Eddie
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
bore the scars of that day and he was
 
01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
deeply involved with the the group of
 
01:48:51.870 --> 01:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
survivors proving that the state of
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
Israel and the Johnson Administration
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
deliberately staged the attack to try
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
and draw the us into the Israeli
 
01:48:59.870 --> 01:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
Egyptian Six-Day War of 1967 in 2018 he
 
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
was a central figure and collaborator in
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
the book blood in the water which
 
01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
Chronicles this dark episode of American
 
01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:06.750 align:start position:0%
Chronicles this dark episode of American
military

01:49:06.750 --> 01:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
military
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
history so in
 
01:49:11.709 --> 01:49:11.719 align:start position:0%
closing I thank everyone for listening
 
01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
to this testimony I really appreciate
 
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
these men coming vast distances to
 
01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
testify and
 
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
I hope that this committee will see the
 
01:49:27.030 --> 01:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
significance of this issue and bring it
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
forward so we can get to the bottom of
 
01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
this situation
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
that quite frankly he a scar on the
 
01:49:37.870 --> 01:49:37.880 align:start position:0%
legitimacy of congressional
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
investigations in my opinion thank you
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
questions for the prime
 
01:49:46.910 --> 01:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh representative pH Philo sure
 
01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:49:49.510 --> 01:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative um and thank you
 
01:49:51.149 --> 01:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this issue
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
to the committee and thank you to our uh
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
Witnesses today for not only traveling
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
here but now putting it on to the public
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
record what happened and I think for
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
those of us who were not aware bringing
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
it to our attention as well I want to
 
01:50:06.229 --> 01:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
preface this with I think this is
 
01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
important to put onto the public record
 
01:50:11.189 --> 01:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
and begin to figure out what happened
 
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
through an investigation but I'm also
 
01:50:17.589 --> 01:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
aware of the limit of state power that
 
01:50:19.709 --> 01:50:19.719 align:start position:0%
we don't have an ability to subpoena the
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
the Federal government we wouldn't have
 
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to subpoena Federal record
 
01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:25.719 align:start position:0%
so if we were to launch an
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
investigation it is very possible we
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
could get stonewalled but from what I
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
perceive of the intent of the bill and
 
01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
you can correct me if I'm wrong which I
 
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
guess is how I'm going to Loop this into
 
01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
being a question in the end uh what
 
01:50:41.109 --> 01:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
ultimately this is to try to kick the
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
federal government into gear and say
 
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
this actually did occur start doing your
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
jobs would you be amenable to perhaps
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
changing this to an HR to put it on the
 
01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
record that the legislature of New
 
01:50:54.589 --> 01:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire believes this happen thinks
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's important as well as giving some
 
01:50:58.149 --> 01:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
form of State recognition to the
 
01:51:00.750 --> 01:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
survivors more so than an investigation
 
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
which could ultimately be an
 
01:51:03.629 --> 01:51:03.639 align:start position:0%
investigation into nothing because we
 
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a subpoena power or an extr
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
territorial investigation power I would
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
answer the later latter part of your
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
question no I don't believe a house
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
resolution would would achieve what we
 
01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
need to happen which is put onto the
 
01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
official record all of the documents
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
official documents including that um
 
01:51:25.629 --> 01:51:25.639 align:start position:0%
affid davit of Ward Boston in 2004 there
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of things have come to light after
 
01:51:30.589 --> 01:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
the supposed Congressional investigation
 
01:51:32.709 --> 01:51:32.719 align:start position:0%
that need to be brought onto the record
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
so it's not so much a matter of
 
01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
subpoenaing and getting p and getting
 
01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
information that's not readily available
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
although the 200 so pages that are still
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
classified would be helpful and I
 
01:51:44.910 --> 01:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
believe that launching this at the state
 
01:51:46.510 --> 01:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
level and putting pressure on the
 
01:51:48.510 --> 01:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
federal government to release documents
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
that are decades old
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
would lead to more information coming
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
out so no on the house resolution cuz
 
01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
that would just simply say hey we think
 
01:51:59.229 --> 01:51:59.239 align:start position:0%
this is important but the investigation
 
01:52:00.669 --> 01:52:00.679 align:start position:0%
actually says we're having people come
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
and testify there's more sellers that
 
01:52:04.390 --> 01:52:04.400 align:start position:0%
would if we had a full-on investigation
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
we'll be here to testify and I think
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
it's important to get these on the
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
record because otherwise all the
 
01:52:11.229 --> 01:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
platitudes that we give to our veterans
 
01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
really don't mean much that's my
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
personal opinion on that thank you for
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
that explanation anything else for the
 
01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:17.189 align:start position:0%
that explanation anything else for the
prime

01:52:17.189 --> 01:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
prime
 
01:52:21.149 --> 01:52:21.159 align:start position:0%
sponsor yes uh rips of Judy thank you Mr
 
01:52:25.629 --> 01:52:25.639 align:start position:0%
chair uh who was happy New Year and uh I
 
01:52:29.510 --> 01:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
would like to know if someone here knows
 
01:52:33.149 --> 01:52:33.159 align:start position:0%
about the name of that prime minister at
 
01:52:36.629 --> 01:52:36.639 align:start position:0%
that time Le Esko was the Prime Minister
 
01:52:38.270 --> 01:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
of Israel at that
 
01:52:41.629 --> 01:52:41.639 align:start position:0%
time okay yes yeah I remember was
 
01:52:42.669 --> 01:52:42.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier but I didn't remember
 
01:52:45.229 --> 01:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
the name so other
 
01:52:47.229 --> 01:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative thank you
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
for that uh I know you need to get
 
01:52:49.199 --> 01:52:50.550 align:start position:0%
for that uh I know you need to get
downstairs

01:52:50.550 --> 01:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
downstairs
 
01:52:52.109 --> 01:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
so here's what is going to happen at
 
01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
this time we are running late but this
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
is uh what we do um I I have a number of
 
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
other cards and I'm going to uh and I
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
know some of the folks who want to uh
 
01:53:07.069 --> 01:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
testify uh also I I encourage to get
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
downstairs to to be with these survivors
 
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
as they amplify their comments so I'm
 
01:53:14.750 --> 01:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
going to ask that the folks who still
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
want to stay here and testify uh keep
 
01:53:21.510 --> 01:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
their comments to a minute or two uh and
 
01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
then that'll give you a chance to get
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
downstairs so and that is something I
 
01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:27.560 align:start position:0%
can do as the chair and um so we're
 
01:53:30.189 --> 01:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
going to kind of uh be kind of tough on
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
that keep it as succinct as possible
 
01:53:34.350 --> 01:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
because we do need to finish this up we
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
do want to give you a chance to get down
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%

well in the United States we have a
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
federalized system of government and
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's the accountability of the state
 
01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the states to hold the
 
01:58:07.390 --> 01:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
federal government accountable federal
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
government is not competent or even
 
01:58:10.069 --> 01:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
loyal enough to its Sailors to determine
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
the culpability of an act of war against
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
them then it's up to the states to fill
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
that leadership
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
void uh although I'm not a member uh the
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%

01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
to have the tack investigated by
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
Congress is still standing but has
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
currently been ignored uh the question
 
01:58:27.470 --> 01:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be asked is who do our
 
01:58:29.709 --> 01:58:29.719 align:start position:0%
government be accountable for uh the
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
American servicemen of the USS Liberty
 
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:32.760 align:start position:0%

01:58:34.510 --> 01:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
the family friends and neighbors and the
 
01:58:35.950 --> 01:58:35.960 align:start position:0%

01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
government that caters to Americans as a
 
01:58:39.229 --> 01:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire resident I would be
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
thrilled if our state and donor a net
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%

Legion my shipmate Glenn olant with
 
01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
Ernie Gallow one if there he was a
 
01:59:25.550 --> 01:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
current president then National
 
01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
Convention they wouldn't let him have a
 
01:59:32.830 --> 01:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
booth he uh Glenn tore up his uh
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
American Legion card and it fell on a
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
woman they put him in jail for
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
assault for wanting to represent the USS
 
01:59:42.830 --> 01:59:42.840 align:start position:0%

01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
American Legion goes we've been banned
 
01:59:48.069 --> 01:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
for life by the American Legion banned
 
01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:50.520 align:start position:0%

about the American Legion thank you for
 
02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:02.320 align:start position:0%

02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
asked to start a little bit late so that
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%

we'll hopefully get caught up I do want
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
to state that this the subject of uh
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
State sovereignty is something we spent
 
02:01:19.870 --> 02:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
a huge amount of time on already today
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%

on tape we've got all kinds of uh
 
02:01:34.589 --> 02:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
written material uh so that we don't
 
02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
need to hear a lot of the same state
 
02:01:38.669 --> 02:01:38.679 align:start position:0%
sovereignty points that have already
 
02:01:40.709 --> 02:01:40.719 align:start position:0%
been made uh I know that the prime
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor wasn't here so we want to keep
 
02:01:44.950 --> 02:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
this moving we want this to be efficient
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
and effective and we're going to let the
 
02:01:49.149 --> 02:01:49.159 align:start position:0%
prime fully explain his measure and and
 
02:01:52.270 --> 02:01:52.280 align:start position:0%
then those who want to speak uh again I
 
02:01:55.109 --> 02:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
emphasize uh if we've already covered
 
02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
some of the state sovereignty stuff
 
02:01:59.229 --> 02:01:59.239 align:start position:0%

federal relations and Veterans Affair
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
committee I am representative Santa also
 
02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
representing the towns of ring Jaffrey
 
02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
and Dublin House Bill
 
02:02:27.550 --> 02:02:27.560 align:start position:0%
1130 establishes a statutory committee
 
02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
to study the economic legal and
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
sociological aspects of New Hampshire
 
02:02:33.990 --> 02:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
exerting its sovereign state
 
02:02:36.510 --> 02:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
rights I chose to introduce this bill
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
this year because I think it's critical
 
02:02:40.149 --> 02:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is prepared in the
 
02:02:42.669 --> 02:02:42.679 align:start position:0%
case of a national divorce or similar
 
02:02:44.910 --> 02:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
incident that would drive New Hampshire
 
02:02:46.149 --> 02:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
to Char's
 
02:02:48.669 --> 02:02:48.679 align:start position:0%
Independence you do not need to support
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh the Hampshire Independence to support
 
02:02:53.709 --> 02:02:53.719 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill is about emergency
 
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
preparedness in a time when so many
 
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
political leaders are floating the idea
 
02:02:59.790 --> 02:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
of a national divorce it is critical
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has a sound plan for
 
02:03:04.069 --> 02:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
exiting the United States if that
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
scenario were to occur movements in
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
Texas and California are exploring the
 
02:03:11.109 --> 02:03:11.119 align:start position:0%
idea of Independence Gavin Nome even
 
02:03:14.030 --> 02:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
refers to California as a nation state
 
02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
we could be one election away from a
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
massive shakeup in the makeup of the
 
02:03:20.350 --> 02:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
United States in order to prepare for
 
02:03:22.189 --> 02:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
this potential scenario we need to ask
 
02:03:22.199 --> 02:03:23.790 align:start position:0%
this potential scenario we need to ask
critical

02:03:23.790 --> 02:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
critical
 
02:03:26.109 --> 02:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
questions while something like a federal
 
02:03:28.510 --> 02:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
disillusion seems unlikely today I would
 
02:03:29.709 --> 02:03:29.719 align:start position:0%
like to remind the committee that
 
02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
impossible things have often happened
 
02:03:34.069 --> 02:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
throughout history including the sudden
 
02:03:36.430 --> 02:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
breakup of the Soviet Union if someone
 
02:03:39.189 --> 02:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
said in 1988 that the Soviet Union would
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
be completely gone in 5 years they would
 
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
have been considered a crazy person uh
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
and and to demonstrate this is a real
 
02:03:48.669 --> 02:03:48.679 align:start position:0%
possibility it is an Open Secret that
 
02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
the the United States is going to lose
 
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
its reserved currency status the
 
02:03:53.790 --> 02:03:53.800 align:start position:0%
economic social and political
 
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
repercussions of this event is
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
unknowable the study committee would
 
02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
provide a comprehensive analysis of the
 
02:04:03.549 --> 02:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
economic legal and sociological aspects
 
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire exerting its Sovereign
 
02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
rights sovereign state rights it would
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
allow for an in-depth examination of the
 
02:04:12.990 --> 02:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
implications of a potential independent
 
02:04:15.310 --> 02:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire including its relationship
 
02:04:17.430 --> 02:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
with the federal government and other
 
02:04:20.189 --> 02:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
states the comme could identify
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
potential benefits and challenges that
 
02:04:24.030 --> 02:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
an independent New Hampshire May face
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
such as changes to taxation trade and
 
02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:30.830 align:start position:0%
such as changes to taxation trade and
Foreign

02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:32.910 --> 02:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
Relations the findings of the committee
 
02:04:35.589 --> 02:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
could inform future legislation and
 
02:04:37.229 --> 02:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
policy decisions regarding the
 
02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's relationship with the
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
federal government a study committee
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
would Pro promote Civic engagement by
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
encouraging public input and a
 
02:04:47.589 --> 02:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
discussion on this uniquely interesting
 
02:04:49.870 --> 02:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
topic if it would raise awareness about
 
02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
the issue of State sovereignty and how
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
it affects the lives of New Hampshire
 
02:04:56.069 --> 02:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
residents the study committee could
 
02:04:57.910 --> 02:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
serve as a model for other states
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
considering similar
 
02:05:01.390 --> 02:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
issues the work of the state committee
 
02:05:03.069 --> 02:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
could lead to a better understanding of
 
02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
the role of states in the federal system
 
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
and potentially strengthens New
 
02:05:09.149 --> 02:05:09.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's position within the
 
02:05:11.149 --> 02:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
Union New Hampshire will be more
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
prepared for a situation that causes
 
02:05:13.199 --> 02:05:14.430 align:start position:0%
prepared for a situation that causes
independent

02:05:14.430 --> 02:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
independent
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so uh talks of
 
02:05:21.149 --> 02:05:21.159 align:start position:0%
uh in general I think helps the state
 
02:05:22.830 --> 02:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
when bargaining with the federal
 
02:05:25.510 --> 02:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
government uh a lot of people who would
 
02:05:30.510 --> 02:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
not Support cacr 32 uh of 2022 the uh
 
02:05:34.350 --> 02:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
previous uh Independence bill they even
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
though they ins support the bill they
 
02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
understood grievances with the federal
 
02:05:40.589 --> 02:05:40.599 align:start position:0%
government um and they agreed you know
 
02:05:44.229 --> 02:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
often they agreed uh with the with the
 
02:05:45.629 --> 02:05:45.639 align:start position:0%
Grievances but disagreed this is the
 
02:05:48.069 --> 02:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
best method uh or that the federal
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
government was just not out of control
 
02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
enough yet uh so similar to like how uh
 
02:05:55.470 --> 02:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
firearm is a violence deterrent uh you
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
know a criminal won't attack because the
 
02:05:59.470 --> 02:05:59.480 align:start position:0%
gun is perceived as a threat uh true
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
Independence talks is a good tyranny
 
02:06:03.470 --> 02:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
deterrent because the federal government
 
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
will just let off the gas a little bit
 
02:06:07.390 --> 02:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
uh if they fear the rear possibility of
 
02:06:09.109 --> 02:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
States breaking
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
away House Bill 1130 is a Forward
 
02:06:13.709 --> 02:06:13.719 align:start position:0%
Thinking initiative that prepares New
 
02:06:15.790 --> 02:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for all invention alties
 
02:06:18.069 --> 02:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
whether within or outside the Union by
 
02:06:20.669 --> 02:06:20.679 align:start position:0%
examining the intricate e by examining
 
02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
the intricate economic legal and and
 
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
sociological aspects of asserting our
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
state Sovereign rights this bill not
 
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
only equips us with valuable insights
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
for potential Independence but also
 
02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
strengthens our position with the
 
02:06:34.830 --> 02:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
federal government this proactive
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
approach ensures Hampshire remains
 
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
prepared and resilient in the face of an
 
02:06:40.750 --> 02:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
unpredictable future while fostering a
 
02:06:42.549 --> 02:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
deeper understanding of our state's role
 
02:06:43.950 --> 02:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
within the federal
 
02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
system thank you for your time and I
 
02:06:47.310 --> 02:06:47.320 align:start position:0%
will take uh questions from the
 
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative uh I
 
02:06:52.589 --> 02:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
have one quick quick thing you mentioned
 
02:06:54.549 --> 02:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
several times study committee uh you
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
meant study commission I think right
 
02:06:59.910 --> 02:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
study commission is opposed to committee
 
02:07:01.390 --> 02:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay thank you for that
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
correction and and I know that uh
 
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
commissions there are some uh protocols
 
02:07:10.350 --> 02:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
for certain ways to put commissions
 
02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
together the the previous measure we
 
02:07:15.149 --> 02:07:15.159 align:start position:0%
just heard call for a commission as well
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
and and looking at that measure some of
 
02:07:20.669 --> 02:07:20.679 align:start position:0%
the commission members uh we're going to
 
02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
have to check with parliamentarians to
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
see if if it fits the model or the
 
02:07:27.350 --> 02:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
protocols for commission so I'm looking

02:08:33.830 --> 02:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
canning from Winchester so I was part of
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh writing this uh we do not know how
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
those procedures are for for commissions
 
02:08:42.430 --> 02:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
so that'll have to be handled later uh
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
we are going to be able to do something
 
02:08:46.589 --> 02:08:46.599 align:start position:0%
that uh the Texas national movement is
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
not able to do right now uh we're
 
02:08:51.629 --> 02:08:51.639 align:start position:0%
friends with them they're trying to uh
 
02:08:53.270 --> 02:08:53.280 align:start position:0%
our government here in New Hampshire is
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
more open to the people so we might be
 
02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
able to do something here that
 
02:08:59.390 --> 02:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
California and other places can't do we
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
will be the Trailblazers just like we
 
02:09:05.069 --> 02:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
were the Trailblazers on uh in the
 
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
1700s so um I think one person on this
 
02:09:12.229 --> 02:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
committee two years ago asked for a
 
02:09:14.709 --> 02:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
commission and a few other people that
 
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
weren't in this committee they thought
 
02:09:21.270 --> 02:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh cacr 30 2 was too soon so that's why
 
02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
we're doing
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
it thank you again and uh in terms of uh
 
02:09:30.149 --> 02:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
other states I I think California might
 
02:09:32.589 --> 02:09:32.599 align:start position:0%
be well uh advised to see what we're up
 
02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
to here in New Hampshire from time to
 
02:09:37.229 --> 02:09:37.239 align:start position:0%
time that's just me yeah thank you uh
 
02:09:39.510 --> 02:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
they won't be able to talk about it and
 
02:09:42.549 --> 02:09:42.559 align:start position:0%
also the prime sponsor is is he still
 
02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
here yeah yes so to his point about
 
02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
making sure that the uh the language and
 
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
the protocols and the commission members
 
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
fit with with uh whatever the protocols
 
02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
for a commission are that's something
 
02:09:56.589 --> 02:09:56.599 align:start position:0%
that uh I'm sure the prime will will
 
02:09:58.270 --> 02:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
will confirm and these kinds of things
 
02:10:00.350 --> 02:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
do not have to lead to secession uh
 
02:10:02.510 --> 02:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
Catalonia looked into it and then it
 
02:10:05.149 --> 02:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
never happened uh of course there were
 
02:10:06.870 --> 02:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
some abuses on the Spanish side when
 
02:10:08.830 --> 02:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
that happened but it was good for them
 
02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
they did a commission they spent eight
 
02:10:12.750 --> 02:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
years and a lot of money in New
 
02:10:14.669 --> 02:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we won't spend that much
 
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
money little European history there um
 
02:10:20.310 --> 02:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
Bonnie is still here uh Bonnie do you
 
02:10:23.470 --> 02:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
still wish to to testify on
 
02:10:26.189 --> 02:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
this okay Bonnie from Kain was here
 
02:10:27.629 --> 02:10:27.639 align:start position:0%
again we've already spent a lot of time
 
02:10:29.830 --> 02:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
on state sovereignty but uh if you have
 
02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
some new points for this measure uh uh
 
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
take a minute or two for sure go go
 
02:10:40.589 --> 02:10:40.599 align:start position:0%
ahead okay um I work for a press I I'm a
 
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
member of the media and I have
 
02:10:44.549 --> 02:10:44.559 align:start position:0%
interviewed hundreds of people with my
 
02:10:49.229 --> 02:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
husband about secession and asking them
 
02:10:52.229 --> 02:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
what they felt about it and I mean only
 
02:10:53.950 --> 02:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire
 
02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
too overwhelmingly people are in favor
 
02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
of it but a lot of them have questions a
 
02:11:02.430 --> 02:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
lot of them say I can see why that would
 
02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
be a great idea but I have questions and
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
all I want to say is this would be the
 
02:11:08.430 --> 02:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
perfect opportunity to give them solid
 
02:11:12.109 --> 02:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
answers with real data instead of just
 
02:11:14.910 --> 02:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
explain to them what we uh think is most
 
02:11:17.350 --> 02:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
likely true like Alo axelman who
 
02:11:20.830 --> 02:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
testified um two bills ago he has a book
 
02:11:22.750 --> 02:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
called articles of secession and it has
 
02:11:24.390 --> 02:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
all kinds of explanations for many of
 
02:11:26.430 --> 02:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
the frequently asked questions
 
02:11:30.069 --> 02:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
but a commission would um give people
 
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
more concrete answers that's
 
02:11:35.629 --> 02:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
all thank you Bonnie Miss Miss Freeman

02:14:54.790 --> 02:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
two more cards on this measure uh Steve
 
02:14:57.549 --> 02:14:57.559 align:start position:0%
Steven V Stephen welcome you've been
 
02:15:00.549 --> 02:15:00.559 align:start position:0%
here all day you here early early right
 
02:15:02.750 --> 02:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
I promise this will be very very
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
different uh good morning or still
 
02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
morning barely chairman Muffet uh
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee members I'm Steven Valle from
 
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
do and I'm the founder of the club 75
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
Alliance One of several New Hampshire
 
02:15:18.750 --> 02:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
groups advocating for success session
 
02:15:20.870 --> 02:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
but my group is very different from the
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
others I want to do it legally and that
 
02:15:26.030 --> 02:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
means the United States constitutional
 
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
amendment to allow secession modeled
 
02:15:31.350 --> 02:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
after the European Union's article 50
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
which made brexit
 
02:15:35.910 --> 02:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
possible now the politicians in DC
 
02:15:37.790 --> 02:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
aren't going to like this but they need
 
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
to remember they're supposed to be
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
representing the American people and
 
02:15:43.270 --> 02:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
recent polls show that folks are
 
02:15:45.790 --> 02:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
starting to open their minds about
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
secession I want to reach out to to
 
02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
directly to the American people and ask
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
them nicely to please be magnanimous and
 
02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
allow negotiated peaceful secession
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
because it's the proper decent civilized
 
02:16:02.549 --> 02:16:02.559 align:start position:0%
thing to do when a clear majority of a
 
02:16:04.910 --> 02:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
state's residents want independence
 
02:16:06.589 --> 02:16:06.599 align:start position:0%
that's what consent of the government is
 
02:16:06.599 --> 02:16:07.350 align:start position:0%
that's what consent of the government is
all

02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
about my second big difference from the
 
02:16:11.990 --> 02:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
other groups is that I'm happy to wait a
 
02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
few years I actually think secession
 
02:16:17.069 --> 02:16:17.079 align:start position:0%
today would be premature we probably
 
02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the majority in favor
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
yet in any case for me it's not about
 
02:16:26.109 --> 02:16:26.119 align:start position:0%
escaping a broken federal government I
 
02:16:28.350 --> 02:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
don't think DC is broken it's just
 
02:16:30.990 --> 02:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
trying to be all things to all people
 
02:16:32.990 --> 02:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
and we need to get away from that we
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
need to ackowledge that different people
 
02:16:37.509 --> 02:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
want very different things out of
 
02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
government Libertarians like me want
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
small government much smaller than what
 
02:16:46.110 --> 02:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
most Republicans and Democrats want and
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
we're gradually realizing our best
 
02:16:49.870 --> 02:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
strategy is to concentrate ourselves in
 
02:16:51.990 --> 02:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire until we're the majority
 
02:16:55.150 --> 02:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
here and then push for peaceful
 
02:16:57.669 --> 02:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
secession I'm the author of this book
 
02:16:59.910 --> 02:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
which explains in some detail how it
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
could work I call it multilateral
 
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
secession that means carefully listening
 
02:17:09.030 --> 02:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
to all sides especially including the
 
02:17:11.150 --> 02:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
Loyalists those folks already here in
 
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Who Remain loyal to DC and
 
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
who would by that time be a minority in
 
02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
a civilized secession it's vitally
 
02:17:22.349 --> 02:17:22.359 align:start position:0%
important to make reasonable
 
02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
accommodations for the Loyalists and in
 
02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
this case that means grandfathering them
 
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
into the big government benefits they
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
have today my goal for secession is to
 
02:17:34.589 --> 02:17:34.599 align:start position:0%
make lots of Libertarians very happy
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
while maintaining excellent relations
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
with the United States and also making
 
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
sure that nobody in New Hampshire is
 
02:17:45.070 --> 02:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
materially worse off due to secession if
 
02:17:46.469 --> 02:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
it looks like some people would be
 
02:17:48.070 --> 02:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
suffering then as part part of this
 
02:17:50.589 --> 02:17:50.599 align:start position:0%
study commission let's sit down talk
 
02:17:52.750 --> 02:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
about it and see if we can fix it so
 
02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
that secession doesn't hurt anybody so
 
02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
please vote ought to pass on this bill
 
02:18:00.509 --> 02:18:00.519 align:start position:0%
so we can have a civil discussion about
 
02:18:02.429 --> 02:18:02.439 align:start position:0%
secession thank you and I'm happy to
 
02:18:04.110 --> 02:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
take questions thank you Steve you
 
02:18:05.790 --> 02:18:05.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned the term loyalists which says
 
02:18:08.030 --> 02:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
a historical term so this is a different
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
type of loyalist than what we saw in the
 
02:18:13.870 --> 02:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
history books correct it's parallel
 
02:18:15.549 --> 02:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
though it means people who remain loyal
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
to the parent country okay to the
 
02:18:22.429 --> 02:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
existing yeah uh regime so to speak uh
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
if you haven't already if you could
 
02:18:26.429 --> 02:18:26.439 align:start position:0%
submit or get us the name uh
 
02:18:28.509 --> 02:18:28.519 align:start position:0%

02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
Steve Valle Mr Valle uh M Le I see you
 
02:18:55.549 --> 02:18:55.559 align:start position:0%

can tell he's a little bit um schooled
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
on this because you know this has been
 
02:19:05.190 --> 02:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
beat up pretty much through you know our
 
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
committees over the last four or five
 
02:19:10.950 --> 02:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
maybe more years but um you know I
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
concur with chair MF you can grab that
 
02:19:15.150 --> 02:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
information so that we can have a you
 
02:19:19.469 --> 02:19:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:21.669 --> 02:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
educated decision that would be great
 
02:19:24.629 --> 02:19:24.639 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your testimony
 
02:19:29.790 --> 02:19:29.800 align:start position:0%

[Laughter]

02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:19:54.670 --> 02:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm too loud for the committee I
 
02:19:57.389 --> 02:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
apologize um thank you I'm the same
 
02:19:59.190 --> 02:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
person I was when I testified earlier
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
Carla Garrick from Manchester I am also
 
02:20:03.150 --> 02:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
the acting president of the foundation
 
02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire Independence um I'm
 
02:20:09.230 --> 02:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
here to testify in support of
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
hb130 uh last year as many of you know
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
who still serve on the committee we got
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of flak uh it seemed like the
 
02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
feedback was was hey guys this seems
 
02:20:21.070 --> 02:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
premature do you know what you're doing
 
02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
what's going on so uh we heard that and
 
02:20:26.510 --> 02:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
so we drafted this in an attempt to try
 
02:20:28.950 --> 02:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
and really come to the table and start
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
to Grapple with these uh difficult ideas
 
02:20:34.990 --> 02:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
but things that have to be talked about
 
02:20:37.030 --> 02:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
um I think it's fair to say we don't
 
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
have all the answers yet and that's okay
 
02:20:42.670 --> 02:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
we're starting a conversation and it's
 
02:20:45.630 --> 02:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
worth letting our imaginations soar
 
02:20:48.830 --> 02:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
let's say an independent Nation New
 
02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could be a prosperous and
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
peaceful country along the lines of
 
02:20:56.670 --> 02:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
successful countries like Luxembourg
 
02:20:59.550 --> 02:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
lonstein or Switzerland we would have
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
four times the population of Iceland
 
02:21:04.670 --> 02:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
we'd be larger than some countries in
 
02:21:06.910 --> 02:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
Europe we'd be able to work with our
 
02:21:09.389 --> 02:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
neighbors to trade much like countries
 
02:21:12.270 --> 02:21:12.280 align:start position:0%
in the shenzen area in Europe already do
 
02:21:14.190 --> 02:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
so that whole question about oh would I
 
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
have to go through border control to go
 
02:21:19.630 --> 02:21:19.640 align:start position:0%
to Maine to cabin no probably not it's
 
02:21:22.030 --> 02:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
something we could solve uh for people
 
02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:24.319 align:start position:0%
who are concerned about uh Social
 
02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
Security we have a lot of EX Pats who
 
02:21:29.910 --> 02:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
already live in places like Mexico who
 
02:21:32.469 --> 02:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
do receive their Social Security checks
 
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
we could even grapple with something
 
02:21:36.349 --> 02:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
like a duel citizenship you could be a
 
02:21:38.750 --> 02:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
citizen of the great country of New
 
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you could hold duel
 
02:21:43.670 --> 02:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
citizenship with the United States a
 
02:21:45.309 --> 02:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
study committee would give us the
 
02:21:49.070 --> 02:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity and create a safe space for
 
02:21:51.270 --> 02:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
us to explore these ideas of New
 
02:21:53.550 --> 02:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sovereignity maybe we could
 
02:21:55.750 --> 02:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
run on nuclear power I know there bills
 
02:21:58.750 --> 02:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
in front of uh various legis committees
 
02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
at the moment looking at hey could we
 
02:22:02.990 --> 02:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
expand our nuclear and maybe we could
 
02:22:05.270 --> 02:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
export energy maybe we would have
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
competing currencies and we would start
 
02:22:09.950 --> 02:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
to attract Banks and you know crypto
 
02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
companies and people to come invest in
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
our great little country maybe we would
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
actually become the Switzerland of North
 
02:22:20.110 --> 02:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
America the only thing that is stopping
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
us from becoming more awesome is the
 
02:22:25.070 --> 02:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
federal government that is literally
 
02:22:28.110 --> 02:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
destroying our wealth a study committee
 
02:22:30.830 --> 02:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
would be a good compromise between the
 
02:22:32.790 --> 02:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
positions we heard this morning and just
 
02:22:34.429 --> 02:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
saying hey we're going to stick our
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
heads on the sand and do nothing I will
 
02:22:40.429 --> 02:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
ask you guys to think about any actual
 
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
reform that has happened on the federal
 
02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
level in the last 50 years in fact the
 
02:22:49.349 --> 02:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
the bill we heard on the USS Liberty
 
02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
that's 56 and A2 years and these people
 
02:22:54.670 --> 02:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
are still trying to solve a problem so
 
02:22:56.510 --> 02:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know if we're going to wait I don't
 
02:23:00.270 --> 02:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
think it's going to do us any well uh do
 
02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
us well this um we already mentioned the
 
02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
trillions of dollars the unsustained
 
02:23:07.309 --> 02:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
debt the fact that the federal
 
02:23:10.950 --> 02:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
government literally does not respect us
 
02:23:14.190 --> 02:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
um and we're basically I mean New
 
02:23:16.190 --> 02:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is almost like District 12 in
 
02:23:18.510 --> 02:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
the Hunger Game at this stage we just
 
02:23:20.870 --> 02:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
this little Outpost uh where they're
 
02:23:23.870 --> 02:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
leaving us while also claiming things
 
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
like they own your body and that they
 
02:23:28.510 --> 02:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
can force you to inject yourself with
 
02:23:32.110 --> 02:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
things against your will I say no I say
 
02:23:34.750 --> 02:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
no to the federal government I say it's
 
02:23:37.870 --> 02:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
time for all of us to reclaim our right
 
02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
of conscience and support this bill so
 
02:23:43.469 --> 02:23:43.479 align:start position:0%
that we can start to have the
 
02:23:45.790 --> 02:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
conversation so that we don't end up in
 
02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
a mass rush or a panic when the time
 
02:23:52.910 --> 02:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
comes let's plan let's start to have the
 
02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
hard conversations now let's grapple
 
02:23:57.870 --> 02:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
with the real risks that everyone in
 
02:24:02.269 --> 02:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
this room knows we are actually facing
 
02:24:04.990 --> 02:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
um if if we let the federal government
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
go on we are looking at more harm more
 
02:24:10.150 --> 02:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
poverty and more decline in our
 
02:24:12.590 --> 02:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
standards of living I know everyone in
 
02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
this room knows we can do better we
 
02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
demand better we know there are better
 
02:24:21.469 --> 02:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
options and it starts with an appetite
 
02:24:24.269 --> 02:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
for Change and it starts here today with
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
all of you you know you have to be brave
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
to do radical things that actually
 
02:24:32.670 --> 02:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
improve the lives that is how this
 
02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
country was born and I ask all of you
 
02:24:39.230 --> 02:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
here today to be brave to start to
 
02:24:43.070 --> 02:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
actually address the issues that we know
 
02:24:45.269 --> 02:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
are real I will leave you guys with the
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
words of my great grandmother who was in
 
02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
a British concentration camp in South
 
02:24:52.870 --> 02:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
Africa no one knows that during the
 
02:24:56.230 --> 02:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
Anglo War the Brits had concentration
 
02:24:58.950 --> 02:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
camps and they killed
 
02:25:03.070 --> 02:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
25% of all Bor women and children in
 
02:25:05.910 --> 02:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
South Africa my great grandmother would
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
say the five PS proper preparation
 
02:25:12.590 --> 02:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
prevents poor performance let's plan
 
02:25:15.190 --> 02:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
let's do it right let's show everyone in
 
02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
the world that if you sit down and have
 
02:25:19.670 --> 02:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
the hard conversations we can come up
 
02:25:23.070 --> 02:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
with solutions that benefit all of us
 
02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:24.389 align:start position:0%
with solutions that benefit all of us
thank

02:25:24.389 --> 02:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Le has his hand up
 
02:25:30.429 --> 02:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
uh Mr M G would you take one question I
 
02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
will thank you chair M well I can tell
 
02:25:37.630 --> 02:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
you you're in the right committee
 
02:25:39.550 --> 02:25:39.560 align:start position:0%
because everybody in here is brave
 
02:25:42.110 --> 02:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
because they signed the dotted line to
 
02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
give their life to this great country
 
02:25:49.030 --> 02:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm still still undecided I mean we
 
02:25:52.349 --> 02:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
have gone through this in different
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
variations several times nothing you
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
just told me has swayed me to think that
 
02:26:05.230 --> 02:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
succession is succession regardless of
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:26:09.750 --> 02:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
different formalities that you put it
 
02:26:11.349 --> 02:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
through a lack of a better word the
 
02:26:15.070 --> 02:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
different um explanations I'm sorry but
 
02:26:18.269 --> 02:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
I need a little bit more to you know
 
02:26:21.469 --> 02:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
feel like I've gotten you know the the
 
02:26:24.269 --> 02:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
uh the answer I need can you do that in
 
02:26:26.429 --> 02:26:26.439 align:start position:0%
a minute I uh I can do it in the
 
02:26:28.429 --> 02:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
following way I would love to have that
 
02:26:30.190 --> 02:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
conversation with you if you vote for
 
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
the study commission we can have those
 
02:26:35.110 --> 02:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
conversations because we're not saying
 
02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
with the study committee that it's a
 
02:26:41.389 --> 02:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
it's a given it's saying hey what are
 
02:26:43.870 --> 02:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
the problems and if we agree these are
 
02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
the problems what are the
 
02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:48.070 align:start position:0%
the problems what are the
solutions

02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
02:26:52.590 --> 02:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
the best part about not being the chair
 
02:26:56.910 --> 02:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
is I can hand that over to chair
 
02:26:59.870 --> 02:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
office um but you
 
02:27:03.630 --> 02:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
know I I think at a minimum you have to
 
02:27:06.510 --> 02:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
recognize that the problems we're facing
 
02:27:09.030 --> 02:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
federally need to be addressed in some
 
02:27:11.710 --> 02:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
way and so if you have a better idea
 
02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
than us going independent and of course
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
Independence and I think this is
 
02:27:17.590 --> 02:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
important for the committee to stand for
 
02:27:20.269 --> 02:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
me I look at Independence as a spectrum
 
02:27:22.349 --> 02:27:22.359 align:start position:0%
right so secession is the farthest
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
anchor I'm a lawyer by training I
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
understand negotiation if you want
 
02:27:29.550 --> 02:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
something maybe you start there so you
 
02:27:31.790 --> 02:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
can start to incrementally get other
 
02:27:34.910 --> 02:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
things right so maybe we should be
 
02:27:37.269 --> 02:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
looking at nullification more
 
02:27:40.590 --> 02:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
seriously okay the clock is ticking but
 
02:27:42.070 --> 02:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative levit you had your
 
02:27:45.030 --> 02:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
again you got my vote okay for a
 
02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yes I'll take
 
02:27:54.510 --> 02:27:54.520 align:start position:0%

processes these Federal mandates are
 
02:30:56.670 --> 02:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
very expensive to administer and the
 
02:31:00.750 --> 02:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
idea legislation originally originally
 
02:31:05.349 --> 02:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
proposed only had funding at
 
02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
40% however Congress has appropriated
 
02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
only a fraction of the promised funding
 
02:31:16.510 --> 02:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
since the bill was reauthorized in 1990
 
02:31:19.870 --> 02:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
and this resulted in an unfunded mandate
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
that shifts costs for educating students
 
02:31:26.590 --> 02:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
with special needs to our states and
 
02:31:28.870 --> 02:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
local school
 
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
districts for example in 2020 the full
 
02:31:36.429 --> 02:31:36.439 align:start position:0%
40% and again it's only a fraction of
 
02:31:39.630 --> 02:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
the overall total special need cost the
 
02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
full 40% represented about $144 million
 
02:31:48.670 --> 02:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire only 52 million was
 
02:31:51.630 --> 02:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
appropriated as a result of the ideal
 
02:31:54.750 --> 02:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and that left a funding gap
 
02:31:59.670 --> 02:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
of 92 million just for the coverage from
 
02:32:02.309 --> 02:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
02:32:04.950 --> 02:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
legislation these totals have only
 
02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
increased dramatically over the past
 
02:32:09.830 --> 02:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
several years due to the increased
 
02:32:11.230 --> 02:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
demand for
 
02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
services because of some of the postco
 
02:32:18.110 --> 02:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
issues and the Stagger Mental Health
 
02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
crisis full Federal funding of the idea
 
02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
legislation must become a priority and
 
02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
remember this ideal legislation only
 
02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
covers a subset of the total cost of
 
02:32:34.110 --> 02:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
special education
 
02:32:38.230 --> 02:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
needs currently the US House and US
 
02:32:42.510 --> 02:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
Senate have both proposed bills to
 
02:32:46.429 --> 02:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
provide 40 the full 40% of the federal
 
02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
funding for the idea act and these bills
 
02:32:52.150 --> 02:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
are co-sponsored by our federal
 
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
delegation and we're very thankful for
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
that however the problem with these
 
02:33:01.910 --> 02:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
bills is that there is a 10year
 
02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:03.590 align:start position:0%
bills is that there is a 10year
implementation

02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%

02:33:07.790 --> 02:33:07.800 align:start position:0%

funding children and taxpayers cannot
 
02:33:16.510 --> 02:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
wait 10 years for Relief the bulk of the
 
02:33:20.469 --> 02:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
cost of special education services is
 
02:33:24.550 --> 02:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
downshifted onto local property
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers many school districts must
 
02:33:29.910 --> 02:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
make difficult decisions regarding
 
02:33:33.389 --> 02:33:33.399 align:start position:0%

02:34:08.510 --> 02:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
the chain of command to raise the issue

02:34:51.550 --> 02:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
today the purpose of this house
 
02:34:54.469 --> 02:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution is to seek
 
02:34:58.190 --> 02:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support to help communicate a
 
02:35:01.190 --> 02:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
unified message in support of our
 
02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
federal delegation to fully fund at 100%

2.0 act in addition as a bipartisan tool
 
02:35:20.510 --> 02:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
this resolution will Aid our federal
 
02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:24.800 align:start position:0%

Hampshire's special education while
 
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
these Federal bills are debated and as
 
02:35:42.269 --> 02:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
we know there is no guarantee of
 
02:35:46.309 --> 02:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
Passage therefore I respectfully ask ask
 
02:35:51.429 --> 02:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
for unanimous bipartisan support of this
 
02:35:55.429 --> 02:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
HCR and recommend ought to pass to send
 
02:35:59.550 --> 02:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
a strong and unified message so this
 
02:36:02.269 --> 02:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
bill can be moved to the consent
 
02:36:04.830 --> 02:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
calendar thank you and I'll take any
 
02:36:06.870 --> 02:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you represent questions
 
02:36:08.510 --> 02:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
for the prime
 
02:36:10.750 --> 02:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh represent
 
02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
LE thank you chair M how much is
 
02:36:18.190 --> 02:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
currently funded um by the federal
 
02:36:20.269 --> 02:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
government how much of it is currently
 
02:36:24.230 --> 02:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
funded right now 80% correct no it's a
 
02:36:27.030 --> 02:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
very small portion right now that's
 
02:36:30.910 --> 02:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
maybe 18% between the uh federal and
 
02:36:32.469 --> 02:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
state government and you're looking for
 
02:36:37.070 --> 02:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
100 uh of the idea funding so it's 82%
 
02:36:39.150 --> 02:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
increase well this is what was
 
02:36:42.429 --> 02:36:42.439 align:start position:0%
originally esed yes and you want that
 
02:36:44.710 --> 02:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
all federal no State involved right well
 
02:36:46.429 --> 02:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
this is the legislation that we're
 
02:36:48.469 --> 02:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
currently under this is the Mandate that
 
02:36:50.389 --> 02:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
we're currently under from this
 
02:36:52.670 --> 02:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
legislation so we're looking to
 
02:36:56.190 --> 02:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
eliminate the unfunded mandate okay so
 
02:36:57.429 --> 02:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
of course that's going to have to be
 
02:36:59.790 --> 02:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
funded somehow as a taxpayer I mean to
 
02:37:02.190 --> 02:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
the government I mean where the from the
 
02:37:05.469 --> 02:37:05.479 align:start position:0%
80 billion current budget from the US
 
02:37:07.429 --> 02:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Education so you want to
 
02:37:09.110 --> 02:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
take it out of there and what's the
 
02:37:11.429 --> 02:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
current budget definitely not to
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
increase our debt or deficit but to
 
02:37:17.630 --> 02:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
allocate right from our current um
 
02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
expenditure from the US Department of
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
Education is the act no I understand
 
02:37:23.230 --> 02:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
that so where are we at now on the 80
 
02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
billion we above Beyond are we are we
 
02:37:27.510 --> 02:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
asking for more in the next ter yeah is
 
02:37:29.510 --> 02:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
that being used now or do we have like
 
02:37:31.990 --> 02:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
six billion and you know save that's the
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
federal US Department I know I
 
02:37:36.670 --> 02:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
understand that do you I I I believe
 
02:37:39.469 --> 02:37:39.479 align:start position:0%
fully that working with our delegation
 
02:37:42.510 --> 02:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
we could definitely find the funding
 
02:37:47.830 --> 02:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
within that 80 billion to evaluate where
 
02:37:51.070 --> 02:37:51.080 align:start position:0%
funds can be moved into special
 
02:37:53.309 --> 02:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
representative pedmont is uh talking in
 
02:37:54.830 --> 02:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
my ear so I'm going to let him take over
 
02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
if that's okay with you chair off it
 
02:38:00.190 --> 02:38:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:04.190 --> 02:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
ahead F follow up representative go
 
02:38:07.269 --> 02:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
ahead all right uh yes representative
 
02:38:09.389 --> 02:38:09.399 align:start position:0%
Philo thank you for taking my question
 
02:38:11.070 --> 02:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
would passing this bill allow
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
communities to reduce the Reliance on
 
02:38:14.910 --> 02:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
local property taxes and potentially
 
02:38:17.230 --> 02:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
reduce those local property taxes it
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
that is one of the outcomes that should
 
02:38:24.269 --> 02:38:24.279 align:start position:0%
be a result of passing the ideas act
 
02:38:26.910 --> 02:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
fully funded without the 10-year
 
02:38:29.469 --> 02:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
implementation yes it should have a
 
02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
direct impact on property
 
02:38:34.230 --> 02:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
taxes other questions for the prime
 
02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor rep representative yes
 
02:38:39.070 --> 02:38:39.080 align:start position:0%

legislation um involve any change to the
 
02:38:45.389 --> 02:38:45.399 align:start position:0%
per pupil amount that is um currently in

asks our federal delegation to fund what
 
02:39:00.349 --> 02:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
is currently mandated so the discussion
 
02:39:02.670 --> 02:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
about education funding in the state of
 
02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you may have heard
 
02:39:07.389 --> 02:39:07.399 align:start position:0%
recently that our speaker has formed uh
 
02:39:09.870 --> 02:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
a commission or a study committee to
 
02:39:11.990 --> 02:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
look at all of the different funding
 
02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
requirements so there are this is just
 
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the unfunded Mandate of the
 
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
current legislation so there no no
 
02:39:22.990 --> 02:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
changes this is where we are
 
02:39:25.590 --> 02:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
currently thank you other questions for
 
02:39:27.429 --> 02:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
the prime
 
02:39:30.349 --> 02:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh rep representative kery
 
02:39:32.349 --> 02:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
former School Board member yes for for
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
18 years I was a school board member and
 
02:39:37.990 --> 02:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
and our special ed uh payments are about
 
02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
16% not even
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
18% and I do know our Department of
 
02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
Education here in New Hampshire is 100%
 
02:39:49.230 --> 02:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
funded by federal funds so um I'm
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if after and it has been
 
02:39:55.389 --> 02:39:55.399 align:start position:0%
decades that we have not ever seen that
 
02:39:58.269 --> 02:39:58.279 align:start position:0%
40% from the federal government correct
 
02:40:00.790 --> 02:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
there is something different that will
 
02:40:03.550 --> 02:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
be done to move the
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
needle is there passing this um
 
02:40:10.510 --> 02:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully P having our federal
 
02:40:13.870 --> 02:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
delegation change the parameters to pass
 
02:40:17.630 --> 02:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
the new idea 2.0 bill which would
 
02:40:20.910 --> 02:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
provide 100% of the funding over you
 
02:40:23.230 --> 02:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
know not a 10-year timeline but as soon
 
02:40:25.790 --> 02:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
as the bill is passed will have a direct
 
02:40:28.429 --> 02:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
impact on every school district and
 
02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
property tax owner in New Hampshire as
 
02:40:33.070 --> 02:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
you know these costs have absolutely
 
02:40:37.790 --> 02:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
escalated just from 2020 to 2023 the
 
02:40:40.550 --> 02:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
costs have almost doubled and just BEC
 
02:40:43.309 --> 02:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
just because there may be less I mean
 
02:40:46.910 --> 02:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
these costs are very hard to anticipate
 
02:40:48.910 --> 02:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
PE families move in and out of the
 
02:40:51.670 --> 02:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
district so this portion of a school
 
02:40:55.150 --> 02:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
budget is very hard to be predictive and
 
02:40:57.870 --> 02:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
just because maybe um there are less
 
02:41:00.190 --> 02:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
children requiring special needs
 
02:41:02.550 --> 02:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
services that absolutely does not mean
 
02:41:05.790 --> 02:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
that the overall budget would go down so
 
02:41:08.510 --> 02:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
these funds are absolutely critical to
 
02:41:11.349 --> 02:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:13.349 --> 02:41:13.359 align:start position:0%

02:41:59.469 --> 02:41:59.479 align:start position:0%
representative from Sullivan district 7
 
02:42:01.830 --> 02:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
which is planfield Cornish Newport unity
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
and Charlestown and I'm a co-sponsor of
 
02:42:07.389 --> 02:42:07.399 align:start position:0%
this bill U on the education committee
 
02:42:09.710 --> 02:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
we hear from everybody uh teachers
 
02:42:11.550 --> 02:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
students parents administrators
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed taxpayers and whenever
 
02:42:17.710 --> 02:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
I can I ask the question how much of the
 
02:42:20.110 --> 02:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
40% reimbursement for special ed that
 
02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to get does your school
 
02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
district get and I always get the same
 
02:42:27.230 --> 02:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
reaction they roll their eyes they give
 
02:42:30.830 --> 02:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
a nervous Giggle and they say not much
 
02:42:33.830 --> 02:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
and I would say probably 17 is about the
 
02:42:35.950 --> 02:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
percent is about the the number that I
 
02:42:39.070 --> 02:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
usually get um but think of all the
 
02:42:42.309 --> 02:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
Hoops that special ed requirements
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
require uh teachers par educators
 
02:42:48.750 --> 02:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
equipment paperwork regulations and more
 
02:42:50.590 --> 02:42:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh why do we go through all the trouble
 
02:42:52.550 --> 02:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
of jumping through all these hoops if
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
we're only going to get half of the
 
02:42:57.190 --> 02:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
money that we were promised or entitled
 
02:43:01.070 --> 02:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
to um I guess maybe because a little bit
 
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
is better than nothing but I have to ask
 
02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
um everywhere else in life if two
 
02:43:09.950 --> 02:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
parties are in a contract and one party
 
02:43:12.790 --> 02:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
rigs on their part of the contract then
 
02:43:14.670 --> 02:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
the contract is null and void and the
 
02:43:14.680 --> 02:43:16.389 align:start position:0%
the contract is null and void and the
requirement

02:43:16.389 --> 02:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
02:43:19.630 --> 02:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
aren't required anymore yet we continue
 
02:43:22.910 --> 02:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
to do our part and comply with special
 
02:43:22.920 --> 02:43:25.030 align:start position:0%
to do our part and comply with special
ed

02:43:25.030 --> 02:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
ed
 
02:43:27.309 --> 02:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
regulations so yesterday was the first
 
02:43:30.070 --> 02:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
day of a special subcommittee on
 
02:43:32.269 --> 02:43:32.279 align:start position:0%
education funding and one of the bills
 
02:43:34.349 --> 02:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
we're looking at is one that would raise
 
02:43:36.910 --> 02:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
the adequacy part of special ed from
 
02:43:40.429 --> 02:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
$2,100 per student to
 
02:43:43.510 --> 02:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
$27,000 per
 
02:43:46.910 --> 02:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
student if we are even going to think
 
02:43:49.110 --> 02:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
about doing something like that we
 
02:43:52.150 --> 02:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
better make sure that all the holes in
 
02:43:55.790 --> 02:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
our equation for funding are plugged and
 
02:43:58.630 --> 02:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
our federal reimbursement for special ed
 
02:43:59.870 --> 02:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
is one of these
 
02:44:02.429 --> 02:44:02.439 align:start position:0%
holes and that's why I'm supporting this
 
02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
bill our federal de delegation is
 
02:44:09.990 --> 02:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
precisely the first place to start when
 
02:44:12.349 --> 02:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with federal dollars and
 
02:44:14.510 --> 02:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
so I hope you will join me in supporting
 
02:44:16.630 --> 02:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
this resolution thank you and I'm happy
 
02:44:21.150 --> 02:44:21.160 align:start position:0%

funding has been and is
 
02:45:14.670 --> 02:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
presently approximately 20% of our total

of course as all of you know 25% of that
 
02:45:36.630 --> 02:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
is obviously a very significant amount
 
02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
fulfilling promises made by the federal
 
02:45:42.510 --> 02:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
government regarding special education
 
02:45:46.910 --> 02:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
funding would be a much needed relief to
 
02:45:50.830 --> 02:45:50.840 align:start position:0%
our property taxpayers in
 
02:45:56.590 --> 02:45:56.600 align:start position:0%

02:46:31.309 --> 02:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the opportunity to speak to
 
02:46:34.190 --> 02:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
you today and to deliver my testimony in
 
02:46:35.790 --> 02:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
support of
 
02:46:38.590 --> 02:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
hcr1 for the record I am representative
 
02:46:40.790 --> 02:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
Diane power I represent the towns of
 
02:46:42.830 --> 02:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
Brookline Mason and Greenville in
 
02:46:46.190 --> 02:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County District 36
 
02:46:48.550 --> 02:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
today by way of example I'd like to
 
02:46:51.870 --> 02:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
Simply offer you a snapshot of special
 
02:46:54.750 --> 02:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
education in my house district in an
 
02:46:58.389 --> 02:46:58.399 align:start position:0%
effort to illustrate why hcr1 is needed
 
02:47:00.389 --> 02:47:00.399 align:start position:0%
and there's a handout associated with
 
02:47:04.469 --> 02:47:04.479 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to speak to so um look
 
02:47:06.550 --> 02:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
referring to my handout in the middle of
 
02:47:10.990 --> 02:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
that I have a chart so in my um house
 
02:47:14.309 --> 02:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
district there are three towns and there
 
02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
are four school districts um in those
 
02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
three towns so as you can see from from
 
02:47:23.750 --> 02:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
the chart Brookline that's the town that
 
02:47:26.389 --> 02:47:26.399 align:start position:0%
I'm from there's two school districts
 
02:47:28.070 --> 02:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
and then the other two remaining towns
 
02:47:30.190 --> 02:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
that I represent they have one school
 
02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:31.469 align:start position:0%
that I represent they have one school
district

02:47:31.469 --> 02:47:31.479 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:47:35.230 --> 02:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
each so um following along in the chart
 
02:47:37.950 --> 02:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
the N the percentage of students out of
 
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
the total student population that are
 
02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
identified and receive special education
 
02:47:46.309 --> 02:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
services it ranges in anywhere from in
 
02:47:48.510 --> 02:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
the brook line K through 6 School
 
02:47:52.030 --> 02:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
District 20 approximately 21% of the
 
02:47:53.510 --> 02:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
total student
 
02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
population um and on the low end in
 
02:47:59.190 --> 02:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
Mason it's uh almost 12% of the total
 
02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:00.230 align:start position:0%
Mason it's uh almost 12% of the total
student

02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:48:03.550 --> 02:48:03.560 align:start position:0%
population so these figures represent if
 
02:48:06.190 --> 02:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
you look at the last column A A A change
 
02:48:09.030 --> 02:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
in the percentage of students receiving
 
02:48:12.429 --> 02:48:12.439 align:start position:0%
special education services for um from
 
02:48:13.790 --> 02:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
02:48:17.870 --> 02:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
20 um it's an increase of about 30% in
 
02:48:20.230 --> 02:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
the Brookline K through six school
 
02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
district and um you can also see for the
 
02:48:27.070 --> 02:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
msic regional in which is the town of
 
02:48:31.349 --> 02:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
Greenville that's a similar um
 
02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
increase and so looking at the fiscal
 
02:48:39.550 --> 02:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
year 25 special education costs you see
 
02:48:41.870 --> 02:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
that for these school
 
02:48:44.070 --> 02:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
districts that budget is running
 
02:48:47.910 --> 02:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere from from um almost $6 million
 
02:48:50.469 --> 02:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
on the high end to
 
02:48:55.590 --> 02:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
646 um on the low end and for the fiscal
 
02:48:57.790 --> 02:48:57.800 align:start position:0%
year 25 the
 
02:49:02.349 --> 02:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
state is contributing to the special Aid
 
02:49:06.150 --> 02:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
um cost you can see the figures there
 
02:49:11.190 --> 02:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
and from the state in additional it a
 
02:49:12.590 --> 02:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
school district can apply for
 
02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid and that's repres
 
02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
presented um in that middle
 
02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
column so with regards to the federal
 
02:49:24.870 --> 02:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
aid that we are expected to get in these
 
02:49:26.910 --> 02:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
four different school districts as you
 
02:49:30.190 --> 02:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
can see um compared to that first the
 
02:49:33.790 --> 02:49:33.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 sped costs and the
 
02:49:36.790 --> 02:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
estimated federal aid um it ranges
 
02:49:39.229 --> 02:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
anywhere from in the Hollis Brook line
 
02:49:39.239 --> 02:49:40.469 align:start position:0%
anywhere from in the Hollis Brook line
Co-op

02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:40.479 align:start position:0%

02:49:40.479 --> 02:49:42.870 align:start position:0%

$821,000

02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
$821,000
 
02:49:45.830 --> 02:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
to 93 th
 
02:49:50.910 --> 02:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
$93,000 for Mason so what this means is
 
02:49:54.670 --> 02:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
that the amount of special education
 
02:49:57.510 --> 02:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
services that need to be funded at the
 
02:50:00.309 --> 02:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
local level for the towns or the dis
 
02:50:00.319 --> 02:50:01.309 align:start position:0%
local level for the towns or the dis
school

02:50:01.309 --> 02:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:50:04.990 --> 02:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
districts that I represent
 
02:50:07.349 --> 02:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
locally the funding that needs to be
 
02:50:10.830 --> 02:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
raised and appropriated as you can see
 
02:50:14.830 --> 02:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
Brookline 74% Hollis Brookline co-ops 7
 
02:50:19.150 --> 02:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
5% Mason 81% and the mic Regional which
 
02:50:22.429 --> 02:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:26.510 --> 02:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
70% so um it's it's clear if by looking
 
02:50:30.309 --> 02:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
at the data in this chart that state and
 
02:50:33.309 --> 02:50:33.319 align:start position:0%
federal special ed Aid covers only a
 
02:50:37.190 --> 02:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
fraction of the total special ed costs
 
02:50:40.830 --> 02:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
and this burden affects both specialed
 
02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
students as well well as reg regular
 
02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:45.150 align:start position:0%
students as well well as reg regular
education

02:50:45.150 --> 02:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:50:48.229 --> 02:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
students and this is unsustainable for
 
02:50:48.239 --> 02:50:49.469 align:start position:0%
students and this is unsustainable for
the

02:50:49.469 --> 02:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in the three years um since
 
02:50:56.710 --> 02:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2020 three of the four
 
02:51:00.389 --> 02:51:00.399 align:start position:0%
school districts in Hillsboro 36 as as I
 
02:51:03.229 --> 02:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned have experienced increases in
 
02:51:05.469 --> 02:51:05.479 align:start position:0%
the number of students identified and
 
02:51:09.229 --> 02:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
receiving special ed um and the other
 
02:51:11.229 --> 02:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
point that I would like to make in my
 
02:51:14.670 --> 02:51:14.680 align:start position:0%
town Brookline um the Brookline planning
 
02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
board recently conducted a survey
 
02:51:21.710 --> 02:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
Brookline Community survey in the fall
 
02:51:21.720 --> 02:51:22.590 align:start position:0%
Brookline Community survey in the fall
of

02:51:22.590 --> 02:51:22.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:51:27.030 --> 02:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
2023 in order to inform that board
 
02:51:30.190 --> 02:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
regarding the master plan moving forward
 
02:51:32.190 --> 02:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
and in that survey that was conducted
 
02:51:34.870 --> 02:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
both online and inperson submissions
 
02:51:37.030 --> 02:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
they asked the residents to select their
 
02:51:38.990 --> 02:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
top three
 
02:51:42.870 --> 02:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
concerns with regards to the town 70% of
 
02:51:47.030 --> 02:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
the respondents listed local town taxes
 
02:51:49.190 --> 02:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
as their top concern as you can see by
 
02:51:52.150 --> 02:51:52.160 align:start position:0%
the the bar graph there and
 
02:51:54.030 --> 02:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
41% of
 
02:51:56.190 --> 02:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
respondents said that they're concerned
 
02:51:59.229 --> 02:51:59.239 align:start position:0%
about the decline in the quality um of
 
02:52:00.429 --> 02:52:00.439 align:start position:0%
of our
 
02:52:03.389 --> 02:52:03.399 align:start position:0%
schools and
 
02:52:06.590 --> 02:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
um what this means is that with regards
 
02:52:09.229 --> 02:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
to the increasing you know property
 
02:52:11.750 --> 02:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
taxes taxpayers are concerned about
 
02:52:14.790 --> 02:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
their ability to stay in Brookline to be
 
02:52:18.349 --> 02:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
able to afford that and then also with
 
02:52:23.990 --> 02:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
increasing School budgets you know it's
 
02:52:26.030 --> 02:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's having a negative impact on the
 
02:52:29.510 --> 02:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
quality of the um education that we're
 
02:52:31.429 --> 02:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
able to deliver to all
 
02:52:34.309 --> 02:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
students so um in
 
02:52:37.550 --> 02:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
conclusion hcr1 sends an important
 
02:52:39.670 --> 02:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
message to the United States Congress
 
02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
the president and our New Hampshire
 
02:52:43.790 --> 02:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
Congressional Delegation that New
 
02:52:46.150 --> 02:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is is in urgent need of the
 
02:52:49.510 --> 02:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
promised Federal share of specialed
 
02:52:53.469 --> 02:52:53.479 align:start position:0%
funding as soon as possible therefore I
 
02:52:55.750 --> 02:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
urge this committee to vote ought to
 
02:52:59.349 --> 02:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
pass on hcr1 in support of both Granite
 
02:52:59.359 --> 02:53:00.550 align:start position:0%
pass on hcr1 in support of both Granite
State

02:53:00.550 --> 02:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
State
 
02:53:04.670 --> 02:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:07.830 --> 02:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
students receiving both special ed and
 
02:53:09.950 --> 02:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
our regular students thank you Mr
 
02:53:12.510 --> 02:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
chairman that concludes my testimony
 
02:53:13.950 --> 02:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and thank you
 
02:53:15.870 --> 02:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
it's always helpful to get metrics and
 
02:53:17.990 --> 02:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
numbers and graphs like like you've put
 
02:53:19.790 --> 02:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
together here thank you for that
 
02:53:22.670 --> 02:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative Lev thank
 
02:53:24.269 --> 02:53:24.279 align:start position:0%
you chair Mo and I promise I won't get
 
02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
into a debate with the representative
 
02:53:30.670 --> 02:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
because we were we do um debate but I'm
 
02:53:32.070 --> 02:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
I'm voting a yes on this I think it's
 
02:53:34.670 --> 02:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
great um you know I truly think that
 
02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
special ed is
 
02:53:40.229 --> 02:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
probably going to
 
02:53:42.870 --> 02:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
increase exponentially did I say that
 
02:53:49.510 --> 02:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
correct EXP um and with with the and U
 
02:53:54.910 --> 02:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
with society today is the um stress that
 
02:53:59.110 --> 02:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
are are put upon um these state and
 
02:54:03.110 --> 02:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
local governments for funding is huge so
 
02:54:04.790 --> 02:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
if if we can get
 
02:54:08.070 --> 02:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
this um taken care of the majority of it
 
02:54:09.389 --> 02:54:09.399 align:start position:0%
really quick to the federal government I
 
02:54:12.389 --> 02:54:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
awesome uh repr see
 
02:54:18.150 --> 02:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
would you support us looking into taking
 
02:54:20.510 --> 02:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
money from the current voucher build
 
02:54:22.110 --> 02:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
which is growing exponentially and
 
02:54:26.670 --> 02:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
moving it to help fund this at the state
 
02:54:29.030 --> 02:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
level thank you for the question
 
02:54:32.710 --> 02:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
representative so this to me that that's
 
02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
not Germaine to to the scope of this
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
bill this HCR simply sends an message to
 
02:54:42.830 --> 02:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
the to the federal government that they
 
02:54:45.429 --> 02:54:45.439 align:start position:0%
need to
 
02:54:48.269 --> 02:54:48.279 align:start position:0%
support this special ed funding that
 
02:54:50.429 --> 02:54:50.439 align:start position:0%
that's essentially a a partially
 
02:54:53.710 --> 02:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate the the answer to your
 
02:54:56.110 --> 02:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
question would would you know that has
 
02:55:00.870 --> 02:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
to do with other legislation and um I
 
02:55:04.269 --> 02:55:04.279 align:start position:0%
don't see it pertaining to this Bill
 
02:55:07.389 --> 02:55:07.399 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
02:55:09.670 --> 02:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative
 
02:55:12.790 --> 02:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
kry um do you see with the increase in
 
02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
your own community and LED population an
 
02:55:17.910 --> 02:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity missed by the federal
 
02:55:20.229 --> 02:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
government to provide supplemental
 
02:55:22.670 --> 02:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
funding due to children who are
 
02:55:25.269 --> 02:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
essentially victims of the opioid crisis
 
02:55:27.790 --> 02:55:27.800 align:start position:0%
in other words they were born to uh
 
02:55:30.349 --> 02:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
parents who have addictions that then
 
02:55:33.429 --> 02:55:33.439 align:start position:0%
have caused their special ed
 
02:55:35.349 --> 02:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
situations thank you for the question
 
02:55:38.750 --> 02:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative I I'm a State Rep and I I
 
02:55:42.670 --> 02:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
focus on state legislation so I I I'm
 
02:55:45.150 --> 02:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
not elected to federal office therefore
 
02:55:47.990 --> 02:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
I I I would have no comment at the at
 
02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.590 align:start position:0%
I I I would have no comment at the at
this

02:55:50.590 --> 02:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:53.469 --> 02:55:53.479 align:start position:0%
time other
 
02:55:55.950 --> 02:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none that brings us to
 
02:55:59.229 --> 02:55:59.239 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Eric power the the final pink card
 
02:56:03.870 --> 02:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:06.630 --> 02:56:06.640 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you U my name is Eric
 
02:56:08.670 --> 02:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
power I live in
 
02:56:10.910 --> 02:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
Brookline and I'm going to speak in
 
02:56:12.110 --> 02:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
support of
 
02:56:14.790 --> 02:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
hcr1 and I have a handout that's coming
 
02:56:17.389 --> 02:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
around um as we talked about today
 
02:56:19.990 --> 02:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
special education is a mostly unfunded
 
02:56:22.590 --> 02:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
mandate by the by the federal and the
 
02:56:25.389 --> 02:56:25.399 align:start position:0%
state government um and it's negatively
 
02:56:27.590 --> 02:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
impacting both special education and
 
02:56:29.429 --> 02:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
regular education you heard about that
 
02:56:31.269 --> 02:56:31.279 align:start position:0%
from the previous
 
02:56:34.750 --> 02:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
speaker um one of the big problems is
 
02:56:36.550 --> 02:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
that we have a conflict because we're
 
02:56:39.229 --> 02:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
getting this Federal mandate for
 
02:56:41.389 --> 02:56:41.399 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities Education
 
02:56:41.399 --> 02:56:42.750 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities Education
Act

02:56:42.750 --> 02:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
Act
 
02:56:45.550 --> 02:56:45.560 align:start position:0%
Ida and not not getting it fully
 
02:56:47.590 --> 02:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
funded and we have our new hampster
 
02:56:50.510 --> 02:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution part one article 2A which
 
02:56:52.670 --> 02:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
prohibits State unfunded mandates we got
 
02:56:54.110 --> 02:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
a federal unfunded mandate but the
 
02:56:55.830 --> 02:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
state's also contributing to making us
 
02:56:56.910 --> 02:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
do this as
 
02:56:58.990 --> 02:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
well this the federal government as you
 
02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
heard is supposed to fund about
 
02:57:04.269 --> 02:57:04.279 align:start position:0%
40% of special education costs but they
 
02:57:06.710 --> 02:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
only fund it about 14% so they're only
 
02:57:09.110 --> 02:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
meeting about onethird of what they
 
02:57:12.550 --> 02:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
promised and um local taxpayers have to
 
02:57:14.349 --> 02:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
pick up much of the cost it creates a CH
 
02:57:15.950 --> 02:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
challenge for school boards and budget
 
02:57:17.870 --> 02:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
committees to provide a proper education
 
02:57:20.269 --> 02:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
to their students just as a bit of a
 
02:57:22.030 --> 02:57:22.040 align:start position:0%
background I served on the Hollis
 
02:57:23.790 --> 02:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
Brookline Cooperative school board for a
 
02:57:26.429 --> 02:57:26.439 align:start position:0%
term for three years so I have firsthand
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
experience with this with this problem
 
02:57:31.710 --> 02:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
and I also serve on the brook currently
 
02:57:34.150 --> 02:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
a member of the Brookline planning board
 
02:57:36.630 --> 02:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
where we're seeing the problems with the
 
02:57:39.269 --> 02:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
growth and you know the housing and one
 
02:57:42.710 --> 02:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
of the major problems is education
 
02:57:45.870 --> 02:57:45.880 align:start position:0%
growth EXP expenses and part of that is
 
02:57:48.990 --> 02:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
being driven by special education so I
 
02:57:50.950 --> 02:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
I've seen this
 
02:57:53.950 --> 02:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
upfront um the number of public
 
02:57:56.830 --> 02:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
education students is growing and it's
 
02:57:58.670 --> 02:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
growing at an alarming rate over the
 
02:58:01.670 --> 02:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
past three years um if you look
 
02:58:05.469 --> 02:58:05.479 align:start position:0%
Statewide we've had an increase about
 
02:58:08.030 --> 02:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
15.7% of students have been more
 
02:58:10.429 --> 02:58:10.439 align:start position:0%
students have been identified as
 
02:58:11.950 --> 02:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities and are
 
02:58:14.670 --> 02:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
receiving special education services
 
02:58:16.429 --> 02:58:16.439 align:start position:0%
the graph I have here kind of shows sort
 
02:58:18.990 --> 02:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
of a histogram of where you know
 
02:58:21.469 --> 02:58:21.479 align:start position:0%
breaking it down by five percentiles
 
02:58:23.870 --> 02:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
where the increases are occurring and
 
02:58:26.710 --> 02:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
you can see in the red that you know
 
02:58:28.349 --> 02:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a lot more the red as the
 
02:58:30.510 --> 02:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
increases and you see you know we had 26
 
02:58:34.110 --> 02:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
that have seen a 15 to 20% increase so
 
02:58:38.670 --> 02:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
we've had quite a bit of uh demand while
 
02:58:40.670 --> 02:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government is is continuing
 
02:58:42.830 --> 02:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
not to to carry the fair share that they
 
02:58:46.070 --> 02:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
promised us it's a big challenge people
 
02:58:48.429 --> 02:58:48.439 align:start position:0%
have hypo hypothesis about the cause of
 
02:58:50.910 --> 02:58:50.920 align:start position:0%
this some people blame it to the
 
02:58:53.990 --> 02:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
opioid uh problems that we've had some
 
02:58:56.190 --> 02:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
blame it on the remote learning and the
 
02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
and the pandemic response they probably
 
02:59:01.110 --> 02:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
are all contributors to this problem but
 
02:59:02.790 --> 02:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
the point is is that we're getting
 
02:59:05.630 --> 02:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
higher and higher demands for this uh
 
02:59:08.110 --> 02:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
for this uh for special education and
 
02:59:09.389 --> 02:59:09.399 align:start position:0%
we're not getting the assistance from
 
02:59:11.670 --> 02:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government that was
 
02:59:14.710 --> 02:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
promised I was at our deliber session or
 
02:59:17.070 --> 02:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
our budget hearing earlier this uh
 
02:59:19.229 --> 02:59:19.239 align:start position:0%
earlier this week and we looked going
 
02:59:20.950 --> 02:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
through the default budget and it was
 
02:59:23.030 --> 02:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
very disconcerting that everything that
 
02:59:25.950 --> 02:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
was special ed it was over 27% of our
 
02:59:27.990 --> 02:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
budget we couldn't touch we just
 
02:59:30.389 --> 02:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
automatically have to pay for it no
 
02:59:32.670 --> 02:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
local control it's just that's the bill
 
02:59:34.389 --> 02:59:34.399 align:start position:0%
and you have to pay it look at the other
 
02:59:36.269 --> 02:59:36.279 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill so we were forced to
 
02:59:37.990 --> 02:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
look at the regular education Parts if
 
02:59:39.870 --> 02:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
any cuts are
 
02:59:42.190 --> 02:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
needed the the local school district
 
02:59:43.950 --> 02:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
urgently need the federal government to
 
02:59:46.349 --> 02:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
meet their special education commitment
 
02:59:48.389 --> 02:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
to support our sped students and our
 
02:59:51.190 --> 02:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in New Hampshire so I please
 
02:59:54.070 --> 02:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
ask that you recommend OTP on hcr1 and
 
02:59:56.550 --> 02:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you Mr
 
02:59:58.710 --> 02:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
power as I alluded to earlier as a
 
03:00:00.269 --> 03:00:00.279 align:start position:0%
former School Board member like ripson
 
03:00:02.710 --> 03:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
of K and others the this is something
 
03:00:05.590 --> 03:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
that's been out there a long time and uh
 
03:00:07.510 --> 03:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
it can only help to shine a light on it
 
03:00:09.750 --> 03:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
03:00:11.750 --> 03:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
power ripo
 
03:00:15.550 --> 03:00:15.560 align:start position:0%
Cary are you aware of how many uh outof
 
03:00:18.070 --> 03:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
District placements or they're called
 
03:00:21.070 --> 03:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
$100,000 placements your school district
 
03:00:24.309 --> 03:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
is now having to engage in I did I did
 
03:00:25.870 --> 03:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
ask that question and they wanted they
 
03:00:27.429 --> 03:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
were hesitant to do it but I know it was
 
03:00:30.550 --> 03:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
a small number um they wouldn't give me
 
03:00:32.630 --> 03:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
a specific number but my estimate would
 
03:00:35.630 --> 03:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
be it would be less than five but those
 
03:00:37.309 --> 03:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
are those are challenging and you do get
 
03:00:40.030 --> 03:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
some state aid for that um you get the
 
03:00:42.150 --> 03:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
catastrophic aid but it doesn't kick in
 
03:00:44.750 --> 03:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
until uh if you didn't see the last two
 
03:00:46.990 --> 03:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
days ago they released the numbers for
 
03:00:48.590 --> 03:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
the cost per pupil that they're going to
 
03:00:50.550 --> 03:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
use for all the formulas it I think it
 
03:00:52.870 --> 03:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
was 20,000 about
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
20,300 so your catastrophic
 
03:00:58.590 --> 03:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
Aid um at the 10x level would not kick
 
03:00:59.950 --> 03:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
in until the district has already
 
03:01:03.469 --> 03:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
coughed up about $200,000 but in some of
 
03:01:05.510 --> 03:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
that from above $70,000 you'll be paying
 
03:01:10.550 --> 03:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
about only 20% so 0 to 70 you pay uh the
 
03:01:13.349 --> 03:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
full amount then 70 to 200 you pay 20%
 
03:01:15.910 --> 03:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
and above that the state pays the rest
 
03:01:19.030 --> 03:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
but that Gap is is is the problem the if
 
03:01:21.429 --> 03:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
you if you're not aware it's about
 
03:01:23.950 --> 03:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
$28,000 extra
 
03:01:27.510 --> 03:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide that special education costs
 
03:01:28.750 --> 03:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
School District so if you're talking
 
03:01:31.990 --> 03:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
about 20,000 then you got 28,000 so a
 
03:01:34.910 --> 03:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
special ed student is costing local CL
 
03:01:37.710 --> 03:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
costing a total burden of about $488,000
 
03:01:39.870 --> 03:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
a year and that's not a small amount and
 
03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
that's why the problem is so
 
03:01:46.830 --> 03:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
large so cber I just have one question
 
03:01:49.550 --> 03:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um are
 
03:01:52.630 --> 03:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
there any other identified like states
 
03:01:57.150 --> 03:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
that have had this same issue and have
 
03:01:59.229 --> 03:01:59.239 align:start position:0%
used this as a
 
03:02:01.990 --> 03:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
solution I'm not aware if they have the
 
03:02:04.670 --> 03:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
same solution but the the problem is
 
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
Nationwide is my understanding so we're
 
03:02:09.469 --> 03:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
not alone it's just there has to be the
 
03:02:12.030 --> 03:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
will at the federal government to put
 
03:02:14.309 --> 03:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
the money behind the mandate and that's
 
03:02:17.469 --> 03:02:17.479 align:start position:0%
the problem here um so that in Hampshire
 
03:02:19.269 --> 03:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
we're not getting any more or less
 
03:02:21.150 --> 03:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
percentage wise we're still one of the
 
03:02:22.349 --> 03:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
problems but we should tell our
 
03:02:23.710 --> 03:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
delegation they're the ones that are a
 
03:02:26.990 --> 03:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
voice up in in Washington to to get that
 
03:02:29.030 --> 03:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
money out of that 80 billion get it to
 
03:02:31.030 --> 03:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
fund the specialed properly there's
 
03:02:32.630 --> 03:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
certainly some waste there in my opinion
 
03:02:35.389 --> 03:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
that we could that could be tapped
 
03:02:39.510 --> 03:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
into agree with that other
 
03:02:42.550 --> 03:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
questions c n thank you Mr
 
03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:44.110 align:start position:0%
questions c n thank you Mr
power

03:02:44.110 --> 03:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
power
 
03:02:47.309 --> 03:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
and saying No the pink cards and things
 
03:02:50.670 --> 03:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
have thinned out I will end that hearing
 
03:02:52.750 --> 03:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
now at this time uh we're almost caught
 
03:02:54.269 --> 03:02:54.279 align:start position:0%
up I know we're well into the noon time
 
03:02:55.550 --> 03:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
hour we have one more measure this
 
03:02:58.110 --> 03:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
morning there is one pink card there is
 
03:03:01.269 --> 03:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
one sponsor uh and that is me I'm going

lovely towns of canterberry and Lowden
 
03:04:31.750 --> 03:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
this resolution simply affirms the
 
03:04:33.469 --> 03:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
long-standing friendship and mutually
 
03:04:35.670 --> 03:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
beneficial relationship between the
 
03:04:37.429 --> 03:04:37.439 align:start position:0%
United States including New Hampshire
 
03:04:40.030 --> 03:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
one of the states uh and the Republic of
 
03:04:41.790 --> 03:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
China or
 
03:04:44.309 --> 03:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
Taiwan uh New Hampshire has about a quar
 
03:04:46.710 --> 03:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
billion dollars worth of business with
 
03:04:50.830 --> 03:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
Taiwan and companies like Timberland
 
03:04:53.870 --> 03:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
depend on continuing in positive trade
 
03:04:57.070 --> 03:04:57.080 align:start position:0%
environment and this already positive
 
03:04:58.830 --> 03:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
relationship can be further enhanced
 
03:05:01.750 --> 03:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
with with license reciprocity which is
 
03:05:03.830 --> 03:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
in the resolution and more peopl to-
 
03:05:06.309 --> 03:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
people exchanges like uh for those who
 
03:05:09.070 --> 03:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
want to learn Mandarin for example uh
 
03:05:11.790 --> 03:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
full disclosure I was part of a New
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
England legislative delegation invited
 
03:05:15.750 --> 03:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
to Taiwan in
 
03:05:18.550 --> 03:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
October uh that visit included numerous
 
03:05:20.429 --> 03:05:20.439 align:start position:0%
briefings and tours and I was greatly
 
03:05:22.070 --> 03:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
impressed by the freedom and the
 
03:05:24.910 --> 03:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
economic vital Vitality I saw firsthand
 
03:05:24.920 --> 03:05:26.389 align:start position:0%
economic vital Vitality I saw firsthand
in

03:05:26.389 --> 03:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:05:30.150 --> 03:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
Taiwan um Taiwan is evolved from the
 
03:05:32.870 --> 03:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
autocratic state it was over 40 years
 
03:05:35.309 --> 03:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
ago one of the sessions we had in Taiwan
 
03:05:37.309 --> 03:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
was at a prison where where they used to
 
03:05:39.429 --> 03:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
torture people which was an eye opener
 
03:05:41.830 --> 03:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
it was an autocratic state was not a
 
03:05:44.389 --> 03:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
democracy over 40 years ago
 
03:05:48.070 --> 03:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
but it is now a vibrant democracy today
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
in fact the country is hosting free
 
03:05:49.920 --> 03:05:51.389 align:start position:0%
in fact the country is hosting free
elections

03:05:51.389 --> 03:05:51.399 align:start position:0%
elections
 
03:05:54.030 --> 03:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow uh which the world is watching
 
03:05:58.670 --> 03:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
and some of you understand uh why so our
 
03:06:00.469 --> 03:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
relationship with Taiwan is Complicated
 
03:06:02.469 --> 03:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
by the fact that we discouraged or
 
03:06:04.950 --> 03:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
discontinued full diplomatic relations
 
03:06:06.990 --> 03:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
with the ROC the Republic of China with
 
03:06:10.349 --> 03:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
Taiwan in 1979 when we recognized the
 
03:06:12.870 --> 03:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
PRC the people's repu communist People's
 
03:06:15.670 --> 03:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
Republic of China
 
03:06:20.229 --> 03:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
so American policy since then is to have
 
03:06:23.389 --> 03:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
an embassy in Beijing not taipe although
 
03:06:26.349 --> 03:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
we have trade relations and
 
03:06:28.950 --> 03:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
liaison activities we don't formally
 
03:06:32.229 --> 03:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
recognize Taiwan So It's Tricky uh but
 
03:06:34.349 --> 03:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
our American policy has been to oppose
 
03:06:36.830 --> 03:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
any violent military action or invasion
 
03:06:39.150 --> 03:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
of Taiwan by the PRC in fact President
 
03:06:42.469 --> 03:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
Biden more than once has said the
 
03:06:45.469 --> 03:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
commanderin-chief has said that uh he
 
03:06:45.479 --> 03:06:46.910 align:start position:0%
commanderin-chief has said that uh he
would

03:06:46.910 --> 03:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:06:50.150 --> 03:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh fight for Taiwan whether you grew
 
03:06:53.790 --> 03:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
that or not uh that is the state of
 
03:06:55.190 --> 03:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
policy of the commander-in-chief so it
 
03:06:57.550 --> 03:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
is a little bit tricky many of us hope
 
03:06:59.830 --> 03:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
that eventually the PRC and the r can
 
03:07:01.830 --> 03:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
resolve the differences and possibly
 
03:07:04.710 --> 03:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
unite peacefully like uh ger happened in
 
03:07:07.269 --> 03:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
Germany after the fall of European
 
03:07:10.190 --> 03:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
communism but such unification does not
 
03:07:13.910 --> 03:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
appear imminent as long as
 
03:07:16.870 --> 03:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
the PRC the People's Republic of China
 
03:07:18.670 --> 03:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
remains a Communist
 
03:07:21.790 --> 03:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
dictatorship communist China has shown
 
03:07:24.710 --> 03:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
its true colors its red colors time and
 
03:07:27.630 --> 03:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
again as it's emerged as a prominent
 
03:07:30.309 --> 03:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
geopolitical threat to the region to our
 
03:07:33.229 --> 03:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
country to our allies to the cause of
 
03:07:36.990 --> 03:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
Freedom so the PRC People's Republic of
 
03:07:40.030 --> 03:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
China needs to know that the forces of
 
03:07:44.590 --> 03:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
Freedom will stand firm until such time
 
03:07:47.790 --> 03:07:47.800 align:start position:0%
as the PRC evolves into a more
 
03:07:50.190 --> 03:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
pluralistic entity and I'm saying this
 
03:07:52.870 --> 03:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
to the the group in here not a large
 
03:07:57.110 --> 03:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
group but uh I know we know that my
 
03:08:01.110 --> 03:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
words are being heard will be heard uh
 
03:08:02.429 --> 03:08:02.439 align:start position:0%
in a lot of
 
03:08:06.070 --> 03:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
places and they matter and what we do
 
03:08:08.150 --> 03:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
know is that European Communism
 
03:08:10.750 --> 03:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
collapsed suddenly and unexpectedly
 
03:08:14.429 --> 03:08:14.439 align:start position:0%
after 1989 and um we never expected that
 
03:08:16.389 --> 03:08:16.399 align:start position:0%
never saw that coming never dreamed
 
03:08:17.750 --> 03:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
actually those of us who are long enough
 
03:08:19.710 --> 03:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
old enough to remember the 1980s never
 
03:08:23.309 --> 03:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
dreamed I didn't that suddenly communism
 
03:08:25.910 --> 03:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
would collapse and then suddenly it did
 
03:08:29.389 --> 03:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
in Europe so you never know what could
 
03:08:32.790 --> 03:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
happen um supposedly when the PRC
 
03:08:35.030 --> 03:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
absorbed Hong Kong in
 
03:08:38.469 --> 03:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
1997 uh Beijing was going to
 
03:08:41.550 --> 03:08:41.560 align:start position:0%
respect the free Traditions that marked
 
03:08:43.469 --> 03:08:43.479 align:start position:0%
Hong Kong's experiences was a British
 
03:08:45.550 --> 03:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
Crown Colony unfortunately the
 
03:08:47.870 --> 03:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
Communists riged on their agreements and
 
03:08:51.630 --> 03:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
now Hong Kong uh does not have what they
 
03:08:53.070 --> 03:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
were supposed to have which was a
 
03:08:55.790 --> 03:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
measure of autonomy a measure of
 
03:08:59.110 --> 03:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
Freedom so for now Taiwan needs and
 
03:09:01.830 --> 03:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
deserves support as it seeks to maintain
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
its island of
 
03:09:06.510 --> 03:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
freedom and this resolution affirms our
 
03:09:08.830 --> 03:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
support for that democracy if this
 
03:09:10.710 --> 03:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
resolution moves forward will anyone
 
03:09:13.510 --> 03:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
care or notice uh yes
 
03:09:15.710 --> 03:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh again I have no doubt this is this
 
03:09:19.469 --> 03:09:19.479 align:start position:0%
will be online uh that uh the folks in
 
03:09:23.670 --> 03:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
the PRC uh would be acutely aware of of
 
03:09:26.790 --> 03:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
my testimony and if this does uh move
 
03:09:29.150 --> 03:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
forward in the full house uh will it
 
03:09:32.550 --> 03:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
matter uh I think so those of us who
 
03:09:36.349 --> 03:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
visited Taiwan and and care about that
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
Nation not being taken over or ruined uh
 
03:09:44.030 --> 03:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
support support
 
03:09:46.510 --> 03:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
this so uh I hope that when this does
 
03:09:48.309 --> 03:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
get to Executive session that my
 
03:09:50.070 --> 03:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
honorable committee colleagues will give
 
03:09:52.190 --> 03:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
this resolution their fullest
 
03:09:54.269 --> 03:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
consideration and I'd be happy to take
 
03:09:56.710 --> 03:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
questions if there are
 
03:10:00.309 --> 03:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
any do we have any
 
03:10:02.510 --> 03:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
questions thank you to the chair and to
 
03:10:02.520 --> 03:10:03.229 align:start position:0%
questions thank you to the chair and to
the

03:10:03.229 --> 03:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:10:06.790 --> 03:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
chair um just just one question for you
 
03:10:10.229 --> 03:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
um in our effort to to improve relations
 
03:10:12.910 --> 03:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
around the world and to um expand our
 
03:10:15.510 --> 03:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know trade Horizons and our our um
 
03:10:18.950 --> 03:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
peace agreements can you envision um
 
03:10:20.710 --> 03:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
with with China being so hostile about
 
03:10:22.110 --> 03:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
the independence of Taiwan can you
 
03:10:25.229 --> 03:10:25.239 align:start position:0%
envision that the more that we um
 
03:10:27.150 --> 03:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
conduct relations with Taiwan that
 
03:10:30.030 --> 03:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
eventually if they were to to to gain
 
03:10:31.950 --> 03:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
independence completely from China that
 
03:10:34.389 --> 03:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
they would call for armed
 
03:10:36.590 --> 03:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
conflict that's a a good question thank
 
03:10:40.229 --> 03:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
you represent any further question um
 
03:10:42.710 --> 03:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is an election in taiwwan and
 
03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
has having been there I I'm tuned in a
 
03:10:45.990 --> 03:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
little bit to the Dynamics and the
 
03:10:48.750 --> 03:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
current Ru ruling party is much more
 
03:10:51.750 --> 03:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
independent-minded than the previous
 
03:10:55.830 --> 03:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
part of the Colman Tang who used to rule
 
03:11:02.349 --> 03:11:02.359 align:start position:0%
so if if the Pres ruling uh party wins
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
election tomorrow uh there is a movement
 
03:11:09.469 --> 03:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
there that wants to uh no longer claim
 
03:11:12.429 --> 03:11:12.439 align:start position:0%
that they're a province of Greater China
 
03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
that they would be an independent um
 
03:11:19.229 --> 03:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
nation and are are there folks who want
 
03:11:21.349 --> 03:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
that yes there are over there is that
 
03:11:25.550 --> 03:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
the best way to go I I don't know um I I
 
03:11:27.510 --> 03:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
think to your point that the people who
 
03:11:30.190 --> 03:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
want full autonomy know that the
 
03:11:32.030 --> 03:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
People's Republic of China said that
 
03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
that would be caused for war they're
 
03:11:36.990 --> 03:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
already threatening War so I don't know
 
03:11:37.000 --> 03:11:38.510 align:start position:0%
already threatening War so I don't know
if

03:11:38.510 --> 03:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:11:41.150 --> 03:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh we we'll know more after the election
 
03:11:43.710 --> 03:11:43.720 align:start position:0%
tomorrow but uh yes I think there are
 
03:11:47.150 --> 03:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
people that are ready for conflict and I
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
think most of us don't want to see
 
03:11:52.429 --> 03:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
that one one other point I need to make
 
03:11:53.910 --> 03:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
about Taiwan if you're not aware of this
 
03:11:57.429 --> 03:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
but Taiwan is like the the pl the place
 
03:11:59.990 --> 03:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
they're very smart about uh they the
 
03:12:03.070 --> 03:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
advanced semiconductors that everything
 
03:12:04.830 --> 03:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
depends on
 
03:12:08.590 --> 03:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
uh they manufacture like
 
03:12:13.190 --> 03:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
75% of the the entire world's uh uh
 
03:12:16.469 --> 03:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
supply of advanced semiconductors if if
 
03:12:19.950 --> 03:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
Taiwan went to war uh all of a sudden
 
03:12:22.950 --> 03:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
our computers microwaves anything that
 
03:12:26.190 --> 03:12:26.200 align:start position:0%
needs Advanced semiconductors uh would
 
03:12:30.190 --> 03:12:30.200 align:start position:0%
be in Jeopardy big big time so in a way
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's a a they call a silicon shield
 
03:12:34.830 --> 03:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
for Taiwan the fact that they
 
03:12:36.950 --> 03:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
manufacture manufacture these
 
03:12:39.309 --> 03:12:39.319 align:start position:0%
semiconductors that are crucial even red
 
03:12:41.670 --> 03:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
China needs these semiconductors so any
 
03:12:43.190 --> 03:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's another piece of it but thank you
 
03:12:47.830 --> 03:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:53.309 --> 03:12:53.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:56.070 --> 03:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:13:01.510 --> 03:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr M for taking my question um I I
 
03:13:06.389 --> 03:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
was in Hong Kong shortly uh before they
 
03:13:09.150 --> 03:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
uh Chinese took over there and uh I was
 
03:13:11.229 --> 03:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
talking with her he brought this up so I
 
03:13:12.990 --> 03:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
just give you a brief story I was
 
03:13:15.229 --> 03:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
talking with one of the local uh
 
03:13:18.870 --> 03:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
businessmen there and I asked him how he
 
03:13:21.550 --> 03:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
felt and if he thought this was possible
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
he says it like a light switch you flick
 
03:13:27.030 --> 03:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
the switch and the Chinese will take
 
03:13:29.309 --> 03:13:29.319 align:start position:0%
over tomorrow you've got a same
 
03:13:32.750 --> 03:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
situation in Taiwan which I also went to
 
03:13:36.670 --> 03:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
um and uh the most valuable part again
 
03:13:40.150 --> 03:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
is that uh those semiconductors that are
 
03:13:44.670 --> 03:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
are there um do you think that this is I
 
03:13:46.710 --> 03:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
think I will support your your your
 
03:13:49.990 --> 03:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
motion your uh bill here but do you
 
03:13:53.190 --> 03:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
think this is a little too late and the
 
03:13:55.269 --> 03:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
process is already starting for them to
 
03:13:57.550 --> 03:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
take over Taiwan thank you for your
 
03:14:01.309 --> 03:14:01.319 align:start position:0%
question uh the mainland Chinese have
 
03:14:03.590 --> 03:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
had War plans forever and those of you
 
03:14:05.469 --> 03:14:05.479 align:start position:0%
who've been in the military know that
 
03:14:07.469 --> 03:14:07.479 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of plans that are in
 
03:14:09.670 --> 03:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
place that often times will never be
 
03:14:12.030 --> 03:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
used uh and I've seen some of the
 
03:14:14.670 --> 03:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
defense plans on the War uh if the red
 
03:14:17.349 --> 03:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
Chinese were to attack uh this has been
 
03:14:20.710 --> 03:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
war game to death uh but one point I do
 
03:14:23.469 --> 03:14:23.479 align:start position:0%
want to make is that unlike Hong Kong
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
Taiwan has a very big anti-tank ditch
 
03:14:30.309 --> 03:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
around it uh kind of like England had
 
03:14:33.830 --> 03:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
during World War II um and so the
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
logistics and and the challenges of of
 
03:14:40.429 --> 03:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
Crossing 100 miles of ocean water um is
 
03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
really uh problematical uh so I I having
 
03:14:47.150 --> 03:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
been there and studied this a little bit
 
03:14:48.990 --> 03:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
I think that the Taiwanese have a
 
03:14:51.510 --> 03:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
defense plan in place they they've got
 
03:14:54.790 --> 03:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
some sophisticated uh air defenses and
 
03:14:56.510 --> 03:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
and they have some Advanced
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
Fighters uh so if red China did invade
 
03:15:05.710 --> 03:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
it would be uh very ugly uh so I think
 
03:15:07.830 --> 03:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's a little much it's much harder
 
03:15:10.190 --> 03:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
because of the Ocean than it was for
 
03:15:13.030 --> 03:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
Hong Kong and uh
 
03:15:15.190 --> 03:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
and I think the more time that goes by
 
03:15:17.550 --> 03:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
it's the harder it's going to be for
 
03:15:20.389 --> 03:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
demographic reasons for economic reasons
 
03:15:23.469 --> 03:15:23.479 align:start position:0%
uh for the Communist Chinese to to
 
03:15:26.469 --> 03:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
invade but um I know they have plans and
 
03:15:28.510 --> 03:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
we watch and wait and again tomorrow is
 
03:15:31.349 --> 03:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
the election and that'll we'll know a
 
03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:37.550 --> 03:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow yes go ahead thank you
 
03:15:41.389 --> 03:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
represent Vice chair Rollins
 
03:15:44.790 --> 03:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't going to let you get off the
 
03:15:47.710 --> 03:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
hook um follow up to representative
 
03:15:47.720 --> 03:15:50.510 align:start position:0%
hook um follow up to representative
pedmont

03:15:50.510 --> 03:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
pedmont
 
03:15:53.269 --> 03:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
um you know it with with we're doing
 
03:15:55.030 --> 03:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
this on the state
 
03:16:00.030 --> 03:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:01.990 --> 03:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
be very
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
well very well taken up in Congress if
 
03:16:06.790 --> 03:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
this is something we can get
 
03:16:08.790 --> 03:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
done thank you for the question do I
 
03:16:10.229 --> 03:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
think this is something that could be
 
03:16:12.349 --> 03:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
also taken up in Congress in addition to
 
03:16:16.269 --> 03:16:16.279 align:start position:0%
to here in conquer yes and I know that
 
03:16:19.110 --> 03:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
Congress for decades has played paid
 
03:16:22.269 --> 03:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
close attention to Taiwan and like the
 
03:16:25.229 --> 03:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
delegation that I was part of there were
 
03:16:26.670 --> 03:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
I was in a legislative delegation there
 
03:16:28.389 --> 03:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
are congressional delegations that are
 
03:16:32.510 --> 03:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
con con there uh speaker Pelosi famously
 
03:16:35.269 --> 03:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
made a stop in Taiwan that got uh even
 
03:16:38.910 --> 03:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
more attention than my trip gut uh and
 
03:16:41.710 --> 03:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
that makes a statement that that uh when
 
03:16:45.389 --> 03:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
we visit it that we are committed that
 
03:16:45.399 --> 03:16:46.189 align:start position:0%
we visit it that we are committed that
we

03:16:46.189 --> 03:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:16:50.229 --> 03:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
care and uh should something happen uh
 
03:16:53.030 --> 03:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
concurrently in DC I think so so yes I
 
03:16:54.870 --> 03:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
think it is in different ways just the
 
03:16:56.150 --> 03:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
fact that we have all these trade
 
03:16:59.550 --> 03:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
agreements in on the from Washington
 
03:17:03.950 --> 03:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
also from the state levels uh to include
 
03:17:06.510 --> 03:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
uh as I mentioned New Hampshire

chairman thank you for allowing me to
 
03:37:59.750 --> 03:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill HB 1179 has one
 
03:38:03.229 --> 03:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
purpose and that is to uh Grant
 
03:38:06.189 --> 03:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
complimentary access to retired
 
03:38:09.550 --> 03:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
military uh and uh the numbers here have
 
03:38:12.110 --> 03:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
provided come from Massachusetts and New
 
03:38:14.870 --> 03:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we use that because uh
 
03:38:18.349 --> 03:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
division of parks uh assumes that the
 
03:38:20.710 --> 03:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
majority of the visitors to the park use
 
03:38:25.070 --> 03:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
system is uh from those two
 
03:38:25.080 --> 03:38:28.389 align:start position:0%
system is uh from those two
states

03:38:28.389 --> 03:38:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:32.670 --> 03:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
uh the uh numbers that we used uh they
 
03:38:34.870 --> 03:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
averaged that the active duty visits
 
03:38:38.309 --> 03:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
were're running about 3,300 a year uh so
 
03:38:41.550 --> 03:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
we use that number to do our calculation
 
03:38:45.710 --> 03:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
uh and we come up with roughly
 
03:38:45.720 --> 03:38:49.269 align:start position:0%
uh and we come up with roughly
uh

03:38:49.269 --> 03:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:51.510 --> 03:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
15,8 potential
 
03:38:54.070 --> 03:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
retirees at a cost of I'm sorry that was
 
03:38:55.950 --> 03:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
$1 15,8
 
03:39:00.150 --> 03:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
16 uh uh out of uh
 
03:39:00.160 --> 03:39:02.389 align:start position:0%
16 uh uh out of uh
23,25

03:39:02.389 --> 03:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
23,25
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
retirees so if you look at the fiscal
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
note that was provided it says
 
03:39:09.239 --> 03:39:10.990 align:start position:0%
note that was provided it says
361,000

03:39:10.990 --> 03:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
361,000
 
03:39:14.550 --> 03:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
and I believe that number
 
03:39:18.269 --> 03:39:18.279 align:start position:0%
includes disabled veterans and other
 
03:39:20.510 --> 03:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
categories of veterans that are already
 
03:39:25.269 --> 03:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
being granted free access to deuse Parx
 
03:39:29.550 --> 03:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
our number that 16,000 or 15,000 deals
 
03:39:31.469 --> 03:39:31.479 align:start position:0%
strictly with the number of retired
 
03:39:35.070 --> 03:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
military members we want to add to the
 
03:39:39.469 --> 03:39:39.479 align:start position:0%
complimentary uh access to deuse box not
 
03:39:41.229 --> 03:39:41.239 align:start position:0%
a complicated Bill the numbers are not
 
03:39:44.189 --> 03:39:44.199 align:start position:0%
very big big and we're looking at
 
03:39:51.269 --> 03:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:51.279 --> 03:39:52.990 align:start position:0%
 
361,000

03:39:52.990 --> 03:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
361,000
 
03:39:55.750 --> 03:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay and can I are you ready for a
 
03:39:58.630 --> 03:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
question I am okay I'm I'm looking at
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
the uh the wording in in it's a very
 
03:40:04.510 --> 03:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
short measure but I see that the
 
03:40:08.070 --> 03:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
original from from this RSA
 
03:40:10.750 --> 03:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
2116-a 3-g
 
03:40:13.710 --> 03:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
uh section uh paragraph 1 Section B
 
03:40:16.870 --> 03:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's the line that was has been
 
03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
eliminated I think I understand why but
 
03:40:24.110 --> 03:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
is is now this would apply to any
 
03:40:25.990 --> 03:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
retired member of the Armed Forces as
 
03:40:28.150 --> 03:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
defining F Federal
 
03:40:31.990 --> 03:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
Regulations so by adding that I assume
 
03:40:32.000 --> 03:40:33.150 align:start position:0%
Regulations so by adding that I assume
that

03:40:33.150 --> 03:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:33.160 --> 03:40:35.030 align:start position:0%
that
that

03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:40:39.429 --> 03:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
makes section B uh that's been lined out
 
03:40:40.830 --> 03:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
makes that section
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:49.630 --> 03:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
say okay I'm looking not looking at the
 
03:40:53.070 --> 03:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
same item that you
 
03:40:55.550 --> 03:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
are but the
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh numbers we're dealing with is uh of
 
03:41:00.990 --> 03:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
retirees is
 
03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:02.510 align:start position:0%
retirees is
23,25

03:41:02.510 --> 03:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
23,25
 
03:41:06.550 --> 03:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
total uh using 300 uh 3,300 as the uh
 
03:41:09.389 --> 03:41:09.399 align:start position:0%
the number of visits we come up with a
 
03:41:09.399 --> 03:41:10.910 align:start position:0%
the number of visits we come up with a
cost

03:41:10.910 --> 03:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
cost
 
03:41:10.920 --> 03:41:13.710 align:start position:0%

03:43:29.149 --> 03:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:31.510 --> 03:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
welcome Good Friday afternoon thank you
 
03:43:31.520 --> 03:43:32.309 align:start position:0%
welcome Good Friday afternoon thank you
Mr

03:43:32.309 --> 03:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
chairman hopefully you're your day has
 
03:43:36.950 --> 03:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
gone smoothly so I'm here as a
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor proud co-sponsor of this to
 
03:43:40.830 --> 03:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
support our veterans and correct an
 
03:43:42.550 --> 03:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
unintentional carve out that we have an
 
03:43:44.670 --> 03:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
existing law so I think you're all
 
03:43:47.550 --> 03:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
familiar if you're an active active duty
 
03:43:49.349 --> 03:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
member of the Armed Forces you get
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
complimentary admission if you're over
 
03:43:53.309 --> 03:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
65 you get complimentary admission but
 
03:43:55.550 --> 03:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
if you're under 65 and hap happen to
 
03:43:57.309 --> 03:43:57.319 align:start position:0%
have happen to be one of those one in
 
03:44:00.389 --> 03:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
six roughly uh Armed Forces members who
 
03:44:02.990 --> 03:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
are actually retired status you don't
 
03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
get a free pass to our beautiful places
 
03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the state parks so it's
 
03:44:10.550 --> 03:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
a bit of a small uh about that I'm sure
 
03:44:12.189 --> 03:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
is there unintentionally and this bill
 
03:44:14.710 --> 03:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
corrects that it'll cost us actually my
 
03:44:16.510 --> 03:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
written testimony says it's about one
 
03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
sixth of the FIS fiscal note uh because
 
03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
we they used numbers that included all
 
03:44:26.309 --> 03:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
visitors from Mass and New Hampshire and
 
03:44:26.319 --> 03:44:27.149 align:start position:0%
visitors from Mass and New Hampshire and
so

03:44:27.149 --> 03:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:29.469 --> 03:44:29.479 align:start position:0%
$360,000 I think was the estimated cost
 
03:44:31.110 --> 03:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
and the number of those that are
 
03:44:32.990 --> 03:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
estimated to be actually retired status
 
03:44:36.189 --> 03:44:36.199 align:start position:0%
is about uh one and six I'm I've since
 
03:44:37.950 --> 03:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
been corrected it's actually less than
 
03:44:40.750 --> 03:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
that so really 152 ,000 is what we're
 
03:44:43.269 --> 03:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
talking about to allow some of our most
 
03:44:46.269 --> 03:44:46.279 align:start position:0%
valued members uh of the armed services
 
03:44:47.950 --> 03:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
those that have served 20 years and
 
03:44:50.510 --> 03:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
achieved retired status uh but who are
 
03:44:54.229 --> 03:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
still under 65 this will uh give them
 
03:44:56.110 --> 03:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
admission to enjoy those places the very
 
03:44:57.790 --> 03:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
places that many of them fought to
 
03:45:01.510 --> 03:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
defend so I think it's a a a fitting
 
03:45:03.110 --> 03:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
fitting thing to do for our veterans
 
03:45:06.550 --> 03:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
since they often uh gave great sacrifice
 
03:45:08.469 --> 03:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
for purposes of keeping those lands free
 
03:45:10.990 --> 03:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
and our land free so
 
03:45:14.550 --> 03:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh if I may ask
 
03:45:17.070 --> 03:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
you've already addressed this so the the
 
03:45:19.670 --> 03:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
$360,000 figure was a little bit of a
 
03:45:21.790 --> 03:45:21.800 align:start position:0%
attention getter but you explained that
 
03:45:24.269 --> 03:45:24.279 align:start position:0%
that's uh really not
 
03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
accurate you say it's really more like a
 
03:45:29.750 --> 03:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
six of that given the way it's figured
 
03:45:32.070 --> 03:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
even less so I did rough math figuring
 
03:45:34.030 --> 03:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
that about I I had learned that
 
03:45:35.950 --> 03:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
approximately one in six members
 
03:45:38.830 --> 03:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
actually achieve retired status so I
 
03:45:40.790 --> 03:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
just did quick math divided by six I'm
 
03:45:43.790 --> 03:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
told it's actually even less than that
 
03:45:45.590 --> 03:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh and that the LBA LBA will have a look
 
03:45:47.550 --> 03:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
at it and you know of course finance
 
03:45:50.950 --> 03:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
will consider very carefully dollar for
 
03:45:53.870 --> 03:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
dollar uh but it's considerably less and
 
03:45:55.750 --> 03:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
I think we've already known but didn't
 
03:45:57.070 --> 03:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
have time to have the fiscal note
 
03:45:59.790 --> 03:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
revised in terms of the uh the timing of
 
03:46:03.030 --> 03:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
introduction and whatnot um but I'm sure
 
03:46:05.030 --> 03:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
chairman wer will have a and his
 
03:46:06.630 --> 03:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
division chairman will have a close look
 
03:46:08.229 --> 03:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
at the actual number which I believe to
 
03:46:10.910 --> 03:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
be around $15 $20,000
 
03:46:13.670 --> 03:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for that because uh I
 
03:46:15.269 --> 03:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
it's significant to learn that the
 
03:46:19.269 --> 03:46:19.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal note overstated the uh the impact
 
03:46:23.110 --> 03:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
by uh over 80% that's that's pretty
 
03:46:24.870 --> 03:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
significant it honestly it was an
 
03:46:26.830 --> 03:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
attention grabber for me as a co-sponsor
 
03:46:29.070 --> 03:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
when I saw it because of course you
 
03:46:30.950 --> 03:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
generally agree to co-sponsor before you
 
03:46:32.630 --> 03:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
see the fiscal notes many times those
 
03:46:34.710 --> 03:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
come in well after you signed off on the
 
03:46:37.349 --> 03:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
bill yep such was the case here so it
 
03:46:39.429 --> 03:46:39.439 align:start position:0%
was a bit of a attention grabber for me
 
03:46:40.990 --> 03:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh and I did make a couple phone calls
 
03:46:42.229 --> 03:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
and said wait a minute what about this
 
03:46:43.830 --> 03:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
one in six I thought there weren't that
 
03:46:45.990 --> 03:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
many retirees that this actually
 
03:46:48.269 --> 03:46:48.279 align:start position:0%
affected and so I checked with my
 
03:46:51.870 --> 03:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
contacts at uh MOA and esac and and I'm
 
03:46:53.229 --> 03:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty pretty sure on the numbers
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
and I actually know there's at least
 
03:46:57.309 --> 03:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
another rep and another interested party
 
03:46:59.309 --> 03:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
uh behind me who will probably break
 
03:47:01.389 --> 03:47:01.399 align:start position:0%
that down in great
 
03:47:03.590 --> 03:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
detail well thank you for that any any
 
03:47:05.830 --> 03:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
other questions for represent M go yes
 
03:47:08.710 --> 03:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
represent Rollins thank you Mr chairman
 
03:47:11.309 --> 03:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
uh just a question from my constituents
 
03:47:12.910 --> 03:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
what will they have to show for ID in
 
03:47:15.309 --> 03:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
order to get into these state parks uh
 
03:47:17.189 --> 03:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I'm sure DD214
 
03:47:19.070 --> 03:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
would do it but I'm not really sure uh
 
03:47:20.590 --> 03:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
what else I I know there is another
 
03:47:22.510 --> 03:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
military idea but uh not having had the
 
03:47:24.830 --> 03:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
privilege of serving myself I think you
 
03:47:27.149 --> 03:47:27.159 align:start position:0%
just just the military ID and I bet
 
03:47:29.870 --> 03:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative Manion can tell me and
 
03:47:32.469 --> 03:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
certainly uh colon moffa could tell me
 
03:47:35.590 --> 03:47:35.600 align:start position:0%

going to read uh ver ver verbatim into
 
03:49:41.790 --> 03:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
the record here um every everything
 
03:49:44.110 --> 03:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's in here but um the general
 
03:49:46.269 --> 03:49:46.279 align:start position:0%
nature of uh what we're providing is
 
03:49:49.309 --> 03:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
informational purposes uh laying out the
 
03:49:51.750 --> 03:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
intent of uh the structure of the state
 
03:49:55.429 --> 03:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
park system uh in its uh self-funding
 
03:49:59.349 --> 03:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
model uh in in in essence uh so folks
 
03:50:02.389 --> 03:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
are familiar with uh our our whole
 
03:50:05.389 --> 03:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
entire operation is funded through the
 
03:50:07.710 --> 03:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
revenue that we receive through uh
 
03:50:10.110 --> 03:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
admission uh through the visitors who
 
03:50:12.670 --> 03:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
come to our Parks whether to visit deuse
 
03:50:14.910 --> 03:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
or to go camping or through concessions
 
03:50:17.910 --> 03:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
and other uh ancillary uh revenue
 
03:50:21.710 --> 03:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
streams um so we're we're very uh
 
03:50:24.670 --> 03:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
cognizant of uh taking a hard look
 
03:50:27.309 --> 03:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
through our fee package about the um
 
03:50:29.469 --> 03:50:29.479 align:start position:0%
both our rate structure uh and trying to
 
03:50:32.910 --> 03:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
maintain as uh uh an accessible Park
 
03:50:35.790 --> 03:50:35.800 align:start position:0%
system for both residents uh and
 
03:50:39.429 --> 03:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
visitors alike uh to to be able to um um
 
03:50:42.870 --> 03:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
have as lowcost entry as we can but also
 
03:50:46.189 --> 03:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
uh to support uh the the the cost of our
 
03:50:48.510 --> 03:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
operation to be able to maintain uh that
 
03:50:50.429 --> 03:50:50.439 align:start position:0%
Park system and improve on the park
 
03:50:55.349 --> 03:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
system um so um really the the testimony
 
03:50:57.269 --> 03:50:57.279 align:start position:0%
that's here today is just informational
 
03:51:00.429 --> 03:51:00.439 align:start position:0%
with respect to providing uh some uh
 
03:51:03.309 --> 03:51:03.319 align:start position:0%
examples of uh the the statutory
 
03:51:05.670 --> 03:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
language that that speaks to that uh
 
03:51:08.429 --> 03:51:08.439 align:start position:0%
while we're not in it's not set up to be
 
03:51:12.030 --> 03:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh en ly self-funded U that that is the
 
03:51:16.429 --> 03:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
reality of of it and um so anytime uh
 
03:51:19.830 --> 03:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
there's um an opportunity to look at um
 
03:51:22.590 --> 03:51:22.600 align:start position:0%
expanding our complimentary visitation
 
03:51:26.149 --> 03:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
for uh for other user groups um we we
 
03:51:27.269 --> 03:51:27.279 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we're just kind
 
03:51:28.830 --> 03:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
of you know taking a close look at that
 
03:51:30.349 --> 03:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
and understand the impact a couple of
 
03:51:32.309 --> 03:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
the things that I heard as I came into
 
03:51:34.990 --> 03:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
the room here where um one was in
 
03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
respect to uh the fiscal note um our our
 
03:51:39.950 --> 03:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
numbers there were were based on a
 
03:51:43.550 --> 03:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
methodology um of the maximum Financial
 
03:51:45.510 --> 03:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
impact that that could be imposed here I
 
03:51:48.469 --> 03:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
would agree uh with some of the the uh
 
03:51:51.870 --> 03:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
former the prior testimony there that um
 
03:51:54.269 --> 03:51:54.279 align:start position:0%
the the reality of that would be a much
 
03:51:58.269 --> 03:51:58.279 align:start position:0%
much less uh impact um than than the
 
03:52:00.469 --> 03:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
absolute maximum that we um put our
 
03:52:02.750 --> 03:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
methodology in the fiscal note on so um
 
03:52:04.950 --> 03:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
I think that's a a valid point to to
 
03:52:07.830 --> 03:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
bring up uh the other uh question uh
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you rep Rollins for asking
 
03:52:12.670 --> 03:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
um we could certainly use some clarity
 
03:52:15.309 --> 03:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
on uh what would be the inacceptable
 
03:52:18.429 --> 03:52:18.439 align:start position:0%
form of documentation for uh for
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
entrance into the park if this were to
 
03:52:22.469 --> 03:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
move forward one of the most challenging
 
03:52:25.229 --> 03:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
things that we face um and I've been
 
03:52:27.469 --> 03:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
there many times is actually sitting and
 
03:52:30.550 --> 03:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
serving in one of our uh Park entrance
 
03:52:33.830 --> 03:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
booths um and uh the variety of things
 
03:52:36.070 --> 03:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
that come at our staff for that in terms
 
03:52:38.630 --> 03:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
of um you know we're we're we're just
 
03:52:40.590 --> 03:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
coming in from you know the car that was
 
03:52:42.630 --> 03:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
in front of us or we have this pass or
 
03:52:44.389 --> 03:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
this different form of identification if
 
03:52:47.229 --> 03:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
it's not clear or concise it often
 
03:52:50.510 --> 03:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
results in um either an uncomfortable
 
03:52:53.469 --> 03:52:53.479 align:start position:0%
interaction us not having the ability to
 
03:52:55.510 --> 03:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
collect uh where we might have been
 
03:52:58.590 --> 03:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise or turning people around uh
 
03:53:00.229 --> 03:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
and and an impact on the visitor
 
03:53:03.429 --> 03:53:03.439 align:start position:0%
experience or um just kind of backing up
 
03:53:05.910 --> 03:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
the line to get into parks on a busy day
 
03:53:09.389 --> 03:53:09.399 align:start position:0%
as well too so if there is uh something
 
03:53:11.510 --> 03:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
a documentation or something that's
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
specific to retired uh military that
 
03:53:16.830 --> 03:53:16.840 align:start position:0%
could be added to the language uh that
 
03:53:18.590 --> 03:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
would absolutely be very helpful for us
 
03:53:19.590 --> 03:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:53:23.469 --> 03:53:23.479 align:start position:0%
too thank you for that questions for Mr
 
03:53:26.229 --> 03:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
Wilson uh representative levit so it
 
03:53:28.630 --> 03:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
says here that um it's it's I'm sorry
 
03:53:31.110 --> 03:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh by um chair mofet for
 
03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you so this is
 
03:53:37.750 --> 03:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
just for retirees veterans I mean I'm a
 
03:53:39.469 --> 03:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
bet I I show my card they like let me in
 
03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
it's just retirees don't get access to
 
03:53:45.070 --> 03:53:45.080 align:start position:0%
these our our our current fee package
 
03:53:48.269 --> 03:53:48.279 align:start position:0%
includes uh active military yeah uh and
 
03:53:51.469 --> 03:53:51.479 align:start position:0%
disabled veterans okay right so this
 
03:53:53.910 --> 03:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
would add I'm sorry I'm jumping in here
 
03:53:57.469 --> 03:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
but would add re retired and just
 
03:53:59.910 --> 03:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
veterans or disabled veterans I know
 
03:54:02.189 --> 03:54:02.199 align:start position:0%
disabled already get in I understand
 
03:54:04.070 --> 03:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
that but that's just for for the retired
 
03:54:06.510 --> 03:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
do not do not at this time correct okay
 
03:54:13.990 --> 03:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:17.630 --> 03:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:19.950 --> 03:54:19.960 align:start position:0%

Eric power I'm from the town of

Brookline and I also served in the uh
 
03:55:08.830 --> 03:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
the Air Force for 30 years um from 19
 
03:55:10.990 --> 03:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
1988 till
 
03:55:13.990 --> 03:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
2018 uh 28 of those years in the Air
 
03:55:15.790 --> 03:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
National Guard and two years in the Air
 
03:55:15.800 --> 03:55:16.670 align:start position:0%
National Guard and two years in the Air
Force

03:55:16.670 --> 03:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
Force
 
03:55:19.229 --> 03:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
Reserve um so I wanted to just go
 
03:55:20.550 --> 03:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
through a little bit of the calculation
 
03:55:22.229 --> 03:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
you had some you had some perspective
 
03:55:24.590 --> 03:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
here from some of the other testimony
 
03:55:26.590 --> 03:55:26.600 align:start position:0%
but um I'm going to talk through the gra
 
03:55:29.469 --> 03:55:29.479 align:start position:0%
this paper here that has the pie chart
 
03:55:30.870 --> 03:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
um so if you look at New Hampshire
 
03:55:30.880 --> 03:55:31.950 align:start position:0%
um so if you look at New Hampshire
veterans

03:55:31.950 --> 03:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
veterans
 
03:55:36.670 --> 03:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
today you see that only about 9,500 of
 
03:55:39.309 --> 03:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
the veterans are actually
 
03:55:39.319 --> 03:55:40.830 align:start position:0%
the veterans are actually
um

03:55:40.830 --> 03:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:43.110 --> 03:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
retirees active members under New
 
03:55:44.670 --> 03:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law under active members that
 
03:55:46.750 --> 03:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
are four years of service and continuing
 
03:55:49.349 --> 03:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
to serve are considered Veterans as well
 
03:55:52.070 --> 03:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
that that's about 3,800 or 3,900 and
 
03:55:54.189 --> 03:55:54.199 align:start position:0%
then you have about 85,000 that are
 
03:55:57.389 --> 03:55:57.399 align:start position:0%
veterans that are NE not active nor
 
03:55:59.750 --> 03:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
retired and then in down in the left I
 
03:56:01.550 --> 03:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
show that we have about 1,600 members
 
03:56:03.429 --> 03:56:03.439 align:start position:0%
that are active members of the military
 
03:56:04.670 --> 03:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
they're they haven't reached four years
 
03:56:06.790 --> 03:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
of service yet so they aren't quite
 
03:56:09.070 --> 03:56:09.080 align:start position:0%
veterans but uh just to keep it in mind
 
03:56:10.309 --> 03:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
that RSA
 
03:56:13.149 --> 03:56:13.159 align:start position:0%
2150 um describes and I have it listed
 
03:56:15.070 --> 03:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
here about who is a veteran in New
 
03:56:18.070 --> 03:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um
 
03:56:20.550 --> 03:56:20.560 align:start position:0%
currently active service members
 
03:56:22.510 --> 03:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of years of service get
 
03:56:24.389 --> 03:56:24.399 align:start position:0%
admission to the state parks the DAT the
 
03:56:27.309 --> 03:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
day use admission for free as du
 
03:56:27.319 --> 03:56:28.870 align:start position:0%
day use admission for free as du
disabled

03:56:28.870 --> 03:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
disabled
 
03:56:31.510 --> 03:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
veterans um just as a fact and I think
 
03:56:33.670 --> 03:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh one of the state reps had
 
03:56:36.030 --> 03:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned Nationwide into New
 
03:56:38.149 --> 03:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you when you join the
 
03:56:38.159 --> 03:56:39.910 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you when you join the
military

03:56:39.910 --> 03:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
military
 
03:56:42.189 --> 03:56:42.199 align:start position:0%
most people do not make it to retirement
 
03:56:44.110 --> 03:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
about 1 in six or 1 in seven actually
 
03:56:46.670 --> 03:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
makes it to the 20 years of service they
 
03:56:49.910 --> 03:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
qualify uh to uh be
 
03:56:51.870 --> 03:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
retired I just want to talk a little
 
03:56:53.309 --> 03:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
about the fiscal note they talk about
 
03:56:55.309 --> 03:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
the average number of visits per member
 
03:56:58.429 --> 03:56:58.439 align:start position:0%
being 2.65 it's really not a reasonable
 
03:57:00.550 --> 03:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
assumption um and I'll talk about that
 
03:57:02.750 --> 03:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
why in a minute based on some data that
 
03:57:04.429 --> 03:57:04.439 align:start position:0%
came from the park service itself in
 
03:57:04.439 --> 03:57:05.309 align:start position:0%
came from the park service itself in
prior

03:57:05.309 --> 03:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
prior
 
03:57:07.830 --> 03:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
testimony keep in mind that current
 
03:57:09.910 --> 03:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
National Guard member MERS that are E6
 
03:57:11.790 --> 03:57:11.800 align:start position:0%
and below that have retired just from
 
03:57:13.550 --> 03:57:13.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National Guard Army
 
03:57:18.110 --> 03:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
your air um Can currently get
 
03:57:21.429 --> 03:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
admission um no other retirees however
 
03:57:23.950 --> 03:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
can and we already talked about disabled
 
03:57:26.389 --> 03:57:26.399 align:start position:0%
veterans so there's some testimony and
 
03:57:28.030 --> 03:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
the the the the page from the testimony
 
03:57:30.750 --> 03:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
is on the last page but it shows that in
 
03:57:33.389 --> 03:57:33.399 align:start position:0%
the last year available data in
 
03:57:36.870 --> 03:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
2019 they uh State Park wide in New
 
03:57:39.670 --> 03:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 3,300 one complimentary
 
03:57:42.229 --> 03:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
entries were given to active military
 
03:57:44.910 --> 03:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that's in there also
 
03:57:46.910 --> 03:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
assumes that the rate that the active
 
03:57:49.550 --> 03:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
military would use the parks would scale
 
03:57:52.910 --> 03:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
to the same rate that the retirees would
 
03:57:54.269 --> 03:57:54.279 align:start position:0%
based on the number of active duty
 
03:57:56.910 --> 03:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
versus the number of
 
03:57:59.469 --> 03:57:59.479 align:start position:0%
retirees so the the data that you see
 
03:58:02.030 --> 03:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
here um shows and it comes from the
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
defense manow Data Center and it uses
 
03:58:07.149 --> 03:58:07.159 align:start position:0%
the same time frame the FY 2019 which
 
03:58:09.510 --> 03:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
ends in for New Hampshire is in June of
 
03:58:12.870 --> 03:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
2019 shows that um that between New
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Massachusetts where people
 
03:58:16.670 --> 03:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
agree it's a good assumption to say that
 
03:58:18.510 --> 03:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
most the visitors to our state parks are
 
03:58:20.550 --> 03:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
from those two states we would have
 
03:58:20.560 --> 03:58:22.269 align:start position:0%
from those two states we would have
about

03:58:22.269 --> 03:58:22.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:58:25.790 --> 03:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
24,2 44 active military during that time
 
03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
frame with only
 
03:58:32.750 --> 03:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
3,31 visits so it's not
 
03:58:37.389 --> 03:58:37.399 align:start position:0%
2.65 visits per member it's. 136 and
 
03:58:39.990 --> 03:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's the big discrepancy
 
03:58:42.590 --> 03:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
so then if you look at um you know the
 
03:58:44.469 --> 03:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
department of uh military Affairs and
 
03:58:47.710 --> 03:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
Veterans Services reports that 51% of
 
03:58:49.710 --> 03:58:49.720 align:start position:0%
our veterans are 65 years and older so
 
03:58:51.830 --> 03:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
the other group regardless of military
 
03:58:53.309 --> 03:58:53.319 align:start position:0%
affiliation if you're a New Hampshire
 
03:58:55.630 --> 03:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
resident and you're over age 65 you
 
03:58:58.550 --> 03:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
already get you already qualify for uh
 
03:59:00.670 --> 03:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
access so the the number of New
 
03:59:02.309 --> 03:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirees that would be would
 
03:59:05.229 --> 03:59:05.239 align:start position:0%
be about 49% of that current number of
 
03:59:08.790 --> 03:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
retirees in New Hampshire so about 4600
 
03:59:10.389 --> 03:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
we don't do that for Massachusetts so
 
03:59:12.110 --> 03:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
all their retirees would be eligible
 
03:59:12.120 --> 03:59:13.309 align:start position:0%
all their retirees would be eligible
about

03:59:13.309 --> 03:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:59:16.469 --> 03:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
177,000 and the state park has two
 
03:59:18.189 --> 03:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
different fees depending on which Park
 
03:59:20.550 --> 03:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's $4 sometimes it's $5
 
03:59:22.229 --> 03:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
using the upper bound of that we'll use
 
03:59:25.070 --> 03:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
$5 as the Assumption so if we look at
 
03:59:26.870 --> 03:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:59:29.229 --> 03:59:29.239 align:start position:0%
23,000 New Hampshire and Massachusetts
 
03:59:33.070 --> 03:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
new retirees times the 0.136 visits
 
03:59:36.110 --> 03:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
times $5 per visit you see about
 
03:59:40.110 --> 03:59:40.120 align:start position:0%
$15,200 of impact as an upper Bound for
 
03:59:43.630 --> 03:59:43.640 align:start position:0%
the uh for if you if you pass this bill
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
um and if you look at the the the last
 
03:59:47.870 --> 03:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
page again you can see they have um I
 
03:59:49.349 --> 03:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
don't think it shows it there but you
 
03:59:51.750 --> 03:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
can see it on the link they have a right
 
03:59:54.110 --> 03:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
now like in 2019 the numbers that were
 
03:59:56.670 --> 03:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
available they have just over $2 million
 
03:59:58.950 --> 03:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
of uh complimentary programs for
 
04:00:00.750 --> 04:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
everybody that can that's eligible not
 
04:00:02.910 --> 04:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
just the military so this would be an
 
04:00:06.389 --> 04:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
increase of about 3/4 of 1% a very tiny
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
increase for this group of
 
04:00:09.040 --> 04:00:10.630 align:start position:0%
increase for this group of
military

04:00:10.630 --> 04:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
military
 
04:00:12.870 --> 04:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
retirees on the third page I just there
 
04:00:14.670 --> 04:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
was a question that came up and I I have
 
04:00:19.469 --> 04:00:19.479 align:start position:0%
this here um talks about how would you
 
04:00:21.550 --> 04:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
qualify at the gate how would an State
 
04:00:23.950 --> 04:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
Park employee check a military
 
04:00:27.429 --> 04:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
retiree and I'm a military retiree so I
 
04:00:29.389 --> 04:00:29.399 align:start position:0%
do have and I'm so I do have the
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
military retired ID and you see an
 
04:00:33.950 --> 04:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
example fimile here uh that's on the top
 
04:00:37.710 --> 04:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
of that page um that currently shows
 
04:00:39.910 --> 04:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
where you you that you retired it also
 
04:00:40.990 --> 04:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
could say
 
04:00:43.550 --> 04:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
retired or you could say guard retired
 
04:00:45.429 --> 04:00:45.439 align:start position:0%
or Reserve retired depending on what
 
04:00:46.830 --> 04:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
what you were doing when you finished if
 
04:00:48.510 --> 04:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
you retired out of the Guard you retired
 
04:00:50.030 --> 04:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
out of the Reserve I retired out of the
 
04:00:53.710 --> 04:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
reserve so mine says retired Reserve but
 
04:00:56.070 --> 04:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
this this ID could be used very easily
 
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
to determine um if the person is
 
04:01:00.389 --> 04:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
eligible if they don't have that ID then
 
04:01:03.030 --> 04:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
they're not retired so veterans that
 
04:01:05.870 --> 04:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
haven't retired a achieved retirement
 
04:01:08.590 --> 04:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
status wouldn't have this ID and
 
04:01:10.670 --> 04:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
currently we have the laws you mentioned
 
04:01:13.429 --> 04:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
anybody that was that's retired from the
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire National Guard only and is
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
E6 gets complimentary admission that's
 
04:01:19.990 --> 04:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
kind of a challenge for the gate
 
04:01:21.790 --> 04:01:21.800 align:start position:0%
employee to say okay you got the retired
 
04:01:24.429 --> 04:01:24.439 align:start position:0%
Eve now prove to me okay your E6 and
 
04:01:25.990 --> 04:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
Below okay I understand that maybe I
 
04:01:27.950 --> 04:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what the O's are for officer
 
04:01:30.469 --> 04:01:30.479 align:start position:0%
but get that now prove to me you
 
04:01:31.750 --> 04:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
actually retired from the New Hampshire
 
04:01:33.229 --> 04:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
National Guard that's kind of making it
 
04:01:37.309 --> 04:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
more challenging so in in some sense
 
04:01:39.950 --> 04:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
this bill kind of simplifies the process
 
04:01:42.189 --> 04:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
for the gate employees because they know
 
04:01:44.189 --> 04:01:44.199 align:start position:0%
it makes it easier for them to
 
04:01:46.950 --> 04:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
understand what the ID requirements
 
04:01:49.510 --> 04:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
are um one other note I wanted to talk
 
04:01:51.590 --> 04:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
about just for comparison to a
 
04:01:53.389 --> 04:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
neighboring states in in Vermont in
 
04:01:56.670 --> 04:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
Maine they currently provide free State
 
04:01:58.910 --> 04:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
Park admission to all veterans in their
 
04:02:00.510 --> 04:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
states but you have to be a resident of
 
04:02:02.870 --> 04:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
Vermont for Vermont or resident of Maine
 
04:02:05.510 --> 04:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
for Maine just to keep that in mind so
 
04:02:07.550 --> 04:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
we're by adding retirees we're still not
 
04:02:09.910 --> 04:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
up to where where the neighboring states
 
04:02:11.510 --> 04:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
are and I'm not sure if we need to or
 
04:02:13.630 --> 04:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
want to but just as a data
 
04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
point um the other point is some people
 
04:02:19.149 --> 04:02:19.159 align:start position:0%
might say well do we want to include
 
04:02:21.630 --> 04:02:21.640 align:start position:0%
just New Hampshire military retirees
 
04:02:23.070 --> 04:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
because that could easily be verified by
 
04:02:24.750 --> 04:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
showing proof of residency like they do
 
04:02:27.750 --> 04:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
now for age 65 if you're not age 65 show
 
04:02:29.269 --> 04:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
that you're a military retiree that
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
could easily be done is that something
 
04:02:33.950 --> 04:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
we want to do if you only did it for New
 
04:02:35.229 --> 04:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of half of them
 
04:02:37.630 --> 04:02:37.640 align:start position:0%
already being eligible that impact would
 
04:02:41.389 --> 04:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
be less L than $3,200 a year so that
 
04:02:44.550 --> 04:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
would be very small but you know served
 
04:02:47.870 --> 04:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
in the military it's one team one fight
 
04:02:50.269 --> 04:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
all mil all mil military
 
04:02:52.149 --> 04:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
retirees regardless of state of
 
04:02:53.790 --> 04:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
residents have dedicated at least 20
 
04:02:57.269 --> 04:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
years of their life to service so while
 
04:02:58.670 --> 04:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
it sounds attractive you might want to
 
04:02:59.990 --> 04:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
think about that if you wanted to
 
04:03:01.590 --> 04:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
consider an amendment just to make it
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire retirees but I would
 
04:03:05.389 --> 04:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
support either one I think either one is
 
04:03:07.309 --> 04:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
reasonable but keep that in mind do we
 
04:03:09.590 --> 04:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
really want to exclude retirees that
 
04:03:13.309 --> 04:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
come from other states so in summary um
 
04:03:14.710 --> 04:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
providing complimentary State Park
 
04:03:16.429 --> 04:03:16.439 align:start position:0%
admission is a modest gesture it's four
 
04:03:19.469 --> 04:03:19.479 align:start position:0%
or5 dollar per visit this bill would
 
04:03:21.910 --> 04:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
simplify the retire ID check process for
 
04:03:24.990 --> 04:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
state employees that work at the State
 
04:03:28.389 --> 04:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
Parks military retirees are small group
 
04:03:29.950 --> 04:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
of veterans who have served in in
 
04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
sacrificed for at least two decades for
 
04:03:34.990 --> 04:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
our country and the the fiscal impact of
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
just about $155,000 is a very small
 
04:03:39.149 --> 04:03:39.159 align:start position:0%
increase to to the the state park
 
04:03:40.990 --> 04:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
complimentary and discounted entry
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
program for those reasons I recommend
 
04:03:45.630 --> 04:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
that you recommend a to pass or a to
 
04:03:48.030 --> 04:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
pass with Amendment on this Bill thank
 
04:03:50.510 --> 04:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
you for listening and I'll take any
 
04:03:52.389 --> 04:03:52.399 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr P that was
 
04:03:54.870 --> 04:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
helpful with the E6 part and also the uh
 
04:03:57.510 --> 04:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
the FN fiscal note uh background was
 
04:03:59.950 --> 04:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
helpful as well rep represent
 
04:04:02.590 --> 04:04:02.600 align:start position:0%
levit I'm astonished this up through the
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
cracks I mean you can have a army
 
04:04:09.550 --> 04:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
personnel complete active duta
 
04:04:11.990 --> 04:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
training uh complete his tour in four
 
04:04:18.469 --> 04:04:18.479 align:start position:0%

ridiculous this is a no-brainer I mean
 
04:04:38.870 --> 04:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
th this is all we can get into that in
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
the exec
 
04:04:43.349 --> 04:04:43.359 align:start position:0%

04:04:52.429 --> 04:04:52.439 align:start position:0%
questions ripson

Rollins thank you Mr chair um just
 
04:04:57.510 --> 04:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
another question for my constituents say
 
04:04:59.429 --> 04:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
a husband and wife go to a State Beach
 
04:05:01.630 --> 04:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
like sonop State Beach whatever whatever
 
04:05:04.750 --> 04:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
Park and the husband has the paperwork
 
04:05:06.870 --> 04:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
does the wife have to pay or does that
 
04:05:08.710 --> 04:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
include both of them
 
04:05:10.630 --> 04:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
right now the way the law the way that
 
04:05:12.630 --> 04:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is proposed is it only
 
04:05:14.349 --> 04:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
includes the military member themselves
 
04:05:16.189 --> 04:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
unless the spouse is also military
 
04:05:17.630 --> 04:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
member that's
 
04:05:20.110 --> 04:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
retired so I think a couple years ago
 
04:05:21.870 --> 04:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
there was a bill to to look at doing
 
04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
dependence of of of some of the people
 
04:05:26.429 --> 04:05:26.439 align:start position:0%
but I think that that was that made a
 
04:05:30.469 --> 04:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
much bigger number thank you other
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh thank you again

Rollins because I am going to uh
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:06.800 --> 04:06:22.590 align:start position:0%
 
measure

04:06:22.590 --> 04:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:23.950 --> 04:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
okay I'm now I'm going to open up the
 
04:06:25.830 --> 04:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
04:06:28.510 --> 04:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
1355 I'd like to ask uh representative
 
04:06:33.309 --> 04:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:35.950 --> 04:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr Vice
 
04:06:38.070 --> 04:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
chair okay you all have this meas in
 
04:06:40.149 --> 04:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
front of you and you there's just two
 
04:06:42.590 --> 04:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
things I want to point out about
 
04:06:45.389 --> 04:06:45.399 align:start position:0%
it uh the first one you you'll see that
 
04:06:47.510 --> 04:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
it adds the word
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
reenlistment to enlistment so this is be
 
04:06:54.030 --> 04:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
kind of becoming a recruiting and
 
04:06:57.149 --> 04:06:57.159 align:start position:0%
reenlistment measure and then the second
 
04:06:59.670 --> 04:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
part uh you'll see the cash incentive
 
04:07:01.790 --> 04:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
goes up to
 
04:07:04.670 --> 04:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
$6,000 and there is an of course an FN
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
that goes with
 
04:07:10.429 --> 04:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
that of course and um let me just speak
 
04:07:15.550 --> 04:07:15.560 align:start position:0%
to uh why there's a why this there's a
 
04:07:17.590 --> 04:07:17.600 align:start position:0%
need for this type of thing and the ad
 
04:07:19.309 --> 04:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
agitant General is here I know you have
 
04:07:21.630 --> 04:07:21.640 align:start position:0%
in and also there's one or two other
 
04:07:25.670 --> 04:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
cards uh Mr Vice chair that you have and
 
04:07:28.109 --> 04:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
they can speak to the uh recruitment
 
04:07:31.269 --> 04:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
part better I just I'll say at this
 
04:07:33.510 --> 04:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
point is if you don't know and I know
 
04:07:35.149 --> 04:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
most of you do because you're part of
 
04:07:36.830 --> 04:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
this committee where you just know
 
04:07:39.550 --> 04:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
what's going on uh recruiting military
 
04:07:43.269 --> 04:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
recruiting is uh probably having the
 
04:07:46.349 --> 04:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
most difficult time it's had since uh we
 
04:07:50.229 --> 04:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
went to an all volunteer force in
 
04:07:53.710 --> 04:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
1973 I remember 1973 because I turned
 
04:07:56.030 --> 04:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
just when I turned 18 they uh got rid of
 
04:08:00.149 --> 04:08:00.159 align:start position:0%
the draft and as as an aside they get
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
rid of the draft they lowered the
 
04:08:02.950 --> 04:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
drinking aged to 18 the day after I
 
04:08:05.790 --> 04:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
turned 18 so that's how I remember
 
04:08:08.910 --> 04:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
1973 so that's when the all volunteer
 
04:08:11.189 --> 04:08:11.199 align:start position:0%
force uh started we've had it for 50
 
04:08:14.070 --> 04:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
years ever since and at times it's uh
 
04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
missions have been met um right now uh
 
04:08:18.910 --> 04:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
for whatever combination of reasons some
 
04:08:21.269 --> 04:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
of them are demographic we're having a a
 
04:08:25.070 --> 04:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
very difficult time recruiting so that's
 
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
an important part of this as well is uh
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
this will hopefully help uh retention
 
04:08:32.750 --> 04:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
and recruiting so that's my introduction
 
04:08:35.710 --> 04:08:35.720 align:start position:0%
to the bill I will let the agitant
 
04:08:38.469 --> 04:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
general speak better to these d Dynamics
 
04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
but I would try to accept any questions
 
04:08:46.269 --> 04:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:50.710 --> 04:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
here Carri go ahead uh do you know if
 
04:08:53.550 --> 04:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
the current um program that we put in
 
04:08:56.750 --> 04:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
place has been effective and how did you
 
04:08:58.510 --> 04:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
come to the number that you are
 
04:09:01.830 --> 04:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
currently presenting so question was is
 
04:09:03.550 --> 04:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
what do I know about the effectiveness
 
04:09:05.710 --> 04:09:05.720 align:start position:0%
of what we have in place now and how do
 
04:09:08.910 --> 04:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
we come to this number rather than try
 
04:09:12.189 --> 04:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
to answer that as best I can I I would
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
like to defer to the agitant general
 
04:09:16.189 --> 04:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
because this is his world and he's in
 
04:09:19.349 --> 04:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
the midst of it and um so if you don't
 
04:09:23.710 --> 04:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
mind I I will defer to to
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
questions chair
 
04:09:34.109 --> 04:09:34.119 align:start position:0%
uh Mr representative M how do you know
 
04:09:36.590 --> 04:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
how uh this would impact the other
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
branches of the service
 
04:09:41.510 --> 04:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
that are having the same difficulty with
 
04:09:43.830 --> 04:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
recruitment how how might this impact
 
04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
other branches branches of service as
 
04:09:49.469 --> 04:09:49.479 align:start position:0%
well uh New Hampshire just has the uh
 
04:09:52.550 --> 04:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
the N Army National Guard and of course
 
04:09:54.630 --> 04:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
Air National Guard as well so the other
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
services uh would would not be impacted
 
04:10:00.030 --> 04:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
this is aimed at uh New Hampshire and
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire
 
04:10:04.870 --> 04:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
guard uh so I don't think it would help
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:13.630 --> 04:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
okay um but the uh New Hampshire
 
04:10:16.670 --> 04:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
National Guard picks from the same pool
 
04:10:20.389 --> 04:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
yes as individuals here that the other
 
04:10:25.149 --> 04:10:25.159 align:start position:0%
the other uh services do also um if I
 
04:10:27.269 --> 04:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
was to come in again and someone said to
 
04:10:29.349 --> 04:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
me I'm going to give you $6,000 instead
 
04:10:32.030 --> 04:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
of U you know living out in the woods
 
04:10:35.550 --> 04:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
for a couple of months um I would
 
04:10:39.469 --> 04:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:44.990 --> 04:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
yes in terms of of recruiting there are
 
04:10:47.070 --> 04:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
different and I'm I was never a
 
04:10:49.229 --> 04:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
recruiter although in a sense anybody
 
04:10:50.990 --> 04:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
who's ever in the military kind of is a
 
04:10:52.990 --> 04:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
recruiter if you believe in the military
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
you talk it up with people and you
 
04:10:57.269 --> 04:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
encourage them to consider it uh the
 
04:10:58.990 --> 04:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
Marine I was in the Marine Corps Marine
 
04:11:01.229 --> 04:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
Corp had less of a problem with
 
04:11:03.670 --> 04:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
recruiting and some of that goes to the
 
04:11:06.229 --> 04:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
culture that some people want believe it
 
04:11:07.870 --> 04:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
or not some people want to get their
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
butts kicked um in
 
04:11:15.469 --> 04:11:15.479 align:start position:0%
training if you're tracking me and in
 
04:11:17.389 --> 04:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
other people they want they're more
 
04:11:20.149 --> 04:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
about you know education benefits or uh
 
04:11:23.910 --> 04:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
or learning a trade or whatever
 
04:11:28.309 --> 04:11:28.319 align:start position:0%
so uh again I I really want to defer to
 
04:11:31.469 --> 04:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
the uh to the agitant general like I
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
said before to Ripon KY who's immersed
 
04:11:37.189 --> 04:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
in this because um he knows much more
 
04:11:40.550 --> 04:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:43.750 --> 04:11:43.760 align:start position:0%

04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
thankful for that um this reenlistment
 
04:12:41.510 --> 04:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
bonus it was like a referral program
 
04:12:43.349 --> 04:12:43.359 align:start position:0%
right so if you ref if you're currently
 
04:12:45.630 --> 04:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
serving Guardsman or retiree as an
 
04:12:47.149 --> 04:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
enlisted rank or up to the rank of
 
04:12:49.750 --> 04:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
Captain I could refer someone to join
 
04:12:51.510 --> 04:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National Guard army or
 
04:12:54.670 --> 04:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
Heir that was a $1,000 sort of uh uh
 
04:12:56.990 --> 04:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
enlistment incentive program we're
 
04:12:58.710 --> 04:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
typically a family business or a word of
 
04:13:00.750 --> 04:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
mouth business so that helped us with
 
04:13:02.429 --> 04:13:02.439 align:start position:0%
the employment with getting new soldiers
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
and Airmen into our formations so how do
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
you retain them uh the representative
 
04:13:09.510 --> 04:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
over here first like first and foremost
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
generally speaking people join for three
 
04:13:13.309 --> 04:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
reasons a sense of service to their
 
04:13:16.030 --> 04:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
country the educational benefits and
 
04:13:17.630 --> 04:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative maet actually nailed it
 
04:13:19.550 --> 04:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
the challenge of a military lifestyle
 
04:13:20.910 --> 04:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
those are the three primary reasons this
 
04:13:23.030 --> 04:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
next Generation joins how do you keep
 
04:13:23.040 --> 04:13:23.790 align:start position:0%
next Generation joins how do you keep
them

04:13:23.790 --> 04:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:13:27.710 --> 04:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
in so in our formations of about 2800
 
04:13:30.670 --> 04:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
Army and Airmen there's about a 100
 
04:13:33.030 --> 04:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
nocos non-commission officers both Army
 
04:13:35.550 --> 04:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
and air who for whatever reason are
 
04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
ineligible for a federal
 
04:13:37.680 --> 04:13:38.910 align:start position:0%
ineligible for a federal
retention

04:13:38.910 --> 04:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
retention
 
04:13:41.429 --> 04:13:41.439 align:start position:0%
bonus so this is a gap in the system
 
04:13:43.630 --> 04:13:43.640 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to cover so right so
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
when we look at the numbers um we feel
 
04:13:47.790 --> 04:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
like there's eligible pool of about a
 
04:13:49.550 --> 04:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
100 non-commission officers between
 
04:13:51.590 --> 04:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
their years of six and 20 years of
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
service we want to keep them in so
 
04:13:56.429 --> 04:13:56.439 align:start position:0%
that's the incentive here not double
 
04:13:58.550 --> 04:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
dipping if there's a federal retention
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
bonus they're eligible for that is for
 
04:14:02.469 --> 04:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
those who are ineligible for whatever
 
04:14:04.349 --> 04:14:04.359 align:start position:0%
reasons when you look at the past
 
04:14:07.510 --> 04:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
numbers of How It's impacted um our sort
 
04:14:09.950 --> 04:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
of say enlistment so uh representative
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
ker your question earlier was last
 
04:14:15.429 --> 04:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
calendar year we had approximately 20
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
referrals so we have 20 referrals in the
 
04:14:19.990 --> 04:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
Army National Guard for a for structure
 
04:14:23.229 --> 04:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
of 1800 that's moving the Neel over
 
04:14:27.389 --> 04:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
1% right so if we can keep five ncos in
 
04:14:30.149 --> 04:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
for $66,000 for up their six-year uh
 
04:14:33.030 --> 04:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
retention bonus um that's a big deal in
 
04:14:36.269 --> 04:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
our world so those are the broad reasons
 
04:14:38.590 --> 04:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
why you know you you address the lever
 
04:14:40.429 --> 04:14:40.439 align:start position:0%
for us for as a referral business to get
 
04:14:42.590 --> 04:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
people in the door now it's a retention
 
04:14:44.309 --> 04:14:44.319 align:start position:0%
issue to try to keep our service members
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
in specifically only non-commission
 
04:14:48.269 --> 04:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
officers between the ranks of uh between
 
04:14:50.950 --> 04:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
the eligible years of six to 20 years of
 
04:14:53.389 --> 04:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
service subject to your questions and I
 
04:14:55.630 --> 04:14:55.640 align:start position:0%

You representative Li thank you for
 
04:15:50.070 --> 04:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question Vice chair Rollins I
 
04:15:52.070 --> 04:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
don't see the downsides I mean
 
04:15:54.630 --> 04:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
recruiting is down by 30% um I'm not
 
04:15:57.309 --> 04:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
previewed to tell you why I think
 
04:16:00.750 --> 04:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
everybody does have a pretty good idea
 
04:16:05.269 --> 04:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
um you know $6,000 I mean you know for
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who's been
 
04:16:11.630 --> 04:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
um actively serving I is up to is is
 
04:16:13.630 --> 04:16:13.640 align:start position:0%
relatively small in comparison to the
 
04:16:17.830 --> 04:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
market out there now for um new
 
04:16:20.389 --> 04:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
employees um so you're looking for some
 
04:16:23.149 --> 04:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
money is that is that what we're here
 
04:16:26.590 --> 04:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
now sir right now we are comfortable
 
04:16:28.349 --> 04:16:28.359 align:start position:0%
with what the current you know what
 
04:16:30.510 --> 04:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
we're physically yes yeah we're we're
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable with our existing
 
04:16:33.910 --> 04:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
budget what we anticipate is a year or
 
04:16:36.030 --> 04:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
two once we get some data I don't want
 
04:16:37.309 --> 04:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
to mislead you we make come back to you
 
04:16:38.990 --> 04:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
and say Hey listen we might request some
 
04:16:40.830 --> 04:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
more money but right now we are willing
 
04:16:42.630 --> 04:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
to live within our means of the 50 have
 
04:16:43.750 --> 04:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
delate you want to be able to delegate
 
04:16:45.990 --> 04:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
the money to right now certain
 
04:16:47.870 --> 04:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
percentage or whatever it is to
 
04:16:50.109 --> 04:16:50.119 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and part of this is a
 
04:16:52.109 --> 04:16:52.119 align:start position:0%
financial incentive yeah so like for
 
04:16:53.950 --> 04:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
example so what's the downsize here
 
04:16:57.189 --> 04:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
what's the downsize uh we feel none okay
 
04:17:00.510 --> 04:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
right how about the in the um Community
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
the you know National Guard I mean
 
04:17:04.790 --> 04:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
they're all on page on this right uh yes
 
04:17:06.510 --> 04:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
sir and what about Cham off what does he
 
04:17:08.790 --> 04:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
feel about about that Cham off is he on
 
04:17:10.750 --> 04:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
page with that too I think so okay well
 
04:17:14.030 --> 04:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
good good cuz I'm I'm on his side okay
 
04:17:17.870 --> 04:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
so so just one clarification too um
 
04:17:20.510 --> 04:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
every service has a different bonus
 
04:17:22.550 --> 04:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
system right the Army Navy Air Force
 
04:17:24.229 --> 04:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
Marine Coast Guard space force everyone
 
04:17:25.630 --> 04:17:25.640 align:start position:0%
has a different service there was sort
 
04:17:27.750 --> 04:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
of a running joke that says um the
 
04:17:29.630 --> 04:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
Marine cord made their numbers and they
 
04:17:31.550 --> 04:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
don't offer a bonus and the com the
 
04:17:33.469 --> 04:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
Marine Corps recently said your bonuses
 
04:17:34.750 --> 04:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
with the ability to call yourself a
 
04:17:38.670 --> 04:17:38.680 align:start position:0%
marine right that's what they said each
 
04:17:41.070 --> 04:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
service has a different bonus system
 
04:17:43.229 --> 04:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
it's either to the assession to get
 
04:17:46.149 --> 04:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
people in or to retention pce we
 
04:17:48.229 --> 04:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
identified a gap of those who are
 
04:17:50.109 --> 04:17:50.119 align:start position:0%
ineligible and we're trying to fill that
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
Gap with um State resources to try to
 
04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:56.950 --> 04:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
Force follow
 
04:18:00.590 --> 04:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chair and thank you uh
 
04:18:03.910 --> 04:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um what what limited
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
it to uh
 
04:18:05.720 --> 04:18:07.309 align:start position:0%
it to uh
$6,000

04:18:07.309 --> 04:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
$6,000
 
04:18:08.910 --> 04:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
did you feel that that was something
 
04:18:11.710 --> 04:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
that would be uh affordable for your
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
budgets to to work or uh uh S I think it
 
04:18:18.510 --> 04:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
was twofold I think one is like live
 
04:18:19.790 --> 04:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
within your means within our budget
 
04:18:21.309 --> 04:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
constraints and then number two is when
 
04:18:23.070 --> 04:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
you compare to the federal bonuses out
 
04:18:25.349 --> 04:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
there you know for example um you know I
 
04:18:26.630 --> 04:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
think on the federal system there's
 
04:18:29.349 --> 04:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes 10 or $20,000 bonuses right
 
04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
and a bigger bonus for the The increased
 
04:18:34.149 --> 04:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
length of time in years so right now
 
04:18:37.389 --> 04:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
we're strategizing and says okay maybe
 
04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh was it uh $3,000 for three or four
 
04:18:44.670 --> 04:18:44.680 align:start position:0%
years of service and $6,000 for six you
 
04:18:47.910 --> 04:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
trying to incentivize the longer term
 
04:18:50.349 --> 04:18:50.359 align:start position:0%
okay have a
 
04:18:55.550 --> 04:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
followup go ahead yes uh very quickly um
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
I was offered a bonus of $10,000 to
 
04:19:01.870 --> 04:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
reinlist um that was back in
 
04:19:01.880 --> 04:19:04.990 align:start position:0%
reinlist um that was back in
196

04:19:04.990 --> 04:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:07.910 --> 04:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
19772 um then that was the reason I
 
04:19:10.910 --> 04:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
asked that question because back then
 
04:19:14.070 --> 04:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
they were offering x amount of dollars
 
04:19:17.229 --> 04:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
uh more than what you're asking for now
 
04:19:20.269 --> 04:19:20.279 align:start position:0%
and you Pro my opinion would probably be
 
04:19:23.910 --> 04:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
to increase that number I you know
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:32.229 --> 04:19:32.239 align:start position:0%
my representative pie um thank you again
 
04:19:34.269 --> 04:19:34.279 align:start position:0%
I just have one more followup I just uh
 
04:19:37.429 --> 04:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
thought of is this um is this program in
 
04:19:39.670 --> 04:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
um perpetuity or are we only talking
 
04:19:42.870 --> 04:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
about a specific funding for this fiscal
 
04:19:46.710 --> 04:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
year a perpetuity so I think if I
 
04:19:49.309 --> 04:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
understand it correctly um every year
 
04:19:51.750 --> 04:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
there's a $50,000 within our
 
04:19:54.189 --> 04:19:54.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's non-aps thing to
 
04:19:54.199 --> 04:19:55.510 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's non-aps thing to
continue

04:19:55.510 --> 04:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
continue
 
04:19:57.990 --> 04:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
on I I think I answer that
 
04:20:01.389 --> 04:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
correctly representative gagy thank you
 
04:20:05.990 --> 04:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you General uh 1966 I was offered
 
04:20:06.000 --> 04:20:07.550 align:start position:0%
thank you General uh 1966 I was offered
six

04:20:07.550 --> 04:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
six
 
04:20:12.750 --> 04:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
,000 and an upgrade from E4 to E5 if I
 
04:20:15.469 --> 04:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
reenlisted uh didn't do it obviously
 
04:20:17.710 --> 04:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
because my wife we wouldn't be married
 
04:20:21.510 --> 04:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
today uh have have you thought about
 
04:20:23.229 --> 04:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps you
 
04:20:26.070 --> 04:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
incentivizing in addition to the six
 
04:20:29.550 --> 04:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
four 3 to six grand that uh if the
 
04:20:31.790 --> 04:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
person is eligible for an upgrade in
 
04:20:35.510 --> 04:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
rank that that would be offered
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
also can you
 
04:20:41.910 --> 04:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
answer um so in in order for a soldier
 
04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
to promote say from E4 to E5 they have
 
04:20:46.109 --> 04:20:46.119 align:start position:0%
to have a certain number of years
 
04:20:47.910 --> 04:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
remaining in their contract usually that
 
04:20:51.790 --> 04:20:51.800 align:start position:0%
number is three so if they are already
 
04:20:53.670 --> 04:20:53.680 align:start position:0%
coming up on their ETS or end term
 
04:20:56.109 --> 04:20:56.119 align:start position:0%
service then they would be unable to
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
promote unless they extend it and they
 
04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
may fall under this if they already have
 
04:21:02.830 --> 04:21:02.840 align:start position:0%
enough years of service okay that's
 
04:21:05.070 --> 04:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
because I had uh at that time five and a
 
04:21:06.990 --> 04:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
half years two and a half res of time
 
04:21:08.229 --> 04:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
because I was still in high school and
 
04:21:10.550 --> 04:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
three years active so that's why I had
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
the time in okay thank
 
04:21:15.630 --> 04:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
04:21:18.750 --> 04:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
questions a Manion thank you Mr chair
 
04:21:19.990 --> 04:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question General do
 
04:21:21.389 --> 04:21:21.399 align:start position:0%
you guys do any kind of like an exit
 
04:21:23.990 --> 04:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
survey on why they wouldn't
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
reinlist yes we do do you want to
 
04:21:29.590 --> 04:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
discuss some of the exit survey data
 
04:21:33.309 --> 04:21:33.319 align:start position:0%
you usually the challenge is um what we
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
do exit surveys
 
04:21:39.149 --> 04:21:39.159 align:start position:0%
um generally speaking there's two or
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
three probably bigger rocks of why the
 
04:21:42.670 --> 04:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
exit surveys or service members are live
 
04:21:47.149 --> 04:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
in usually 6 to 10 years in um they're
 
04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
establishing their civilian jobs and
 
04:21:51.870 --> 04:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
they might be starting a family buying a
 
04:21:54.429 --> 04:21:54.439 align:start position:0%
house and I'll be honest and blunt a
 
04:21:56.590 --> 04:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
week and a month gets tiring right when
 
04:21:58.109 --> 04:21:58.119 align:start position:0%
you missing the birthday the holiday
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
this or like you know the anniversary
 
04:22:02.429 --> 04:22:02.439 align:start position:0%
this or that so generally speaking it's
 
04:22:04.990 --> 04:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
that Junior solders getting established
 
04:22:07.590 --> 04:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
in his civilian job 70% of our force
 
04:22:09.990 --> 04:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
parttime that shows you one number two
 
04:22:11.189 --> 04:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
is typically probably the college
 
04:22:14.030 --> 04:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
benefits 20 20% of our force is in
 
04:22:16.229 --> 04:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
college so that they understand with the
 
04:22:17.830 --> 04:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
free tuition waiver in the state of New
 
04:22:21.750 --> 04:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's your pathway to success
 
04:22:24.830 --> 04:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
and then probably the third reason is um
 
04:22:26.429 --> 04:22:26.439 align:start position:0%
it it's they might just say the military
 
04:22:29.429 --> 04:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
is not my my cup of tea I I did my term
 
04:22:32.590 --> 04:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
I'm okay I check that block but I I
 
04:22:34.349 --> 04:22:34.359 align:start position:0%
think those are generally the three
 
04:22:38.229 --> 04:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
broader reasons agree I I would agree
 
04:22:40.510 --> 04:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
that those are usually the reasons why
 
04:22:43.550 --> 04:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh service members ETS um I I I would
 
04:22:45.870 --> 04:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
say another piece of this is and this
 
04:22:48.189 --> 04:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
kind of covers it um one of our
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
populations that is not covered under
 
04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
the federal or not eligible for a
 
04:22:53.910 --> 04:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
federal retention bonus or reenlistment
 
04:22:57.630 --> 04:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
bonus is our dual status technicians so
 
04:23:02.030 --> 04:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
specifically our uh internal mechanics
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
not necessarily our AGR Force but the uh
 
04:23:07.149 --> 04:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
GS level or wage grade level Federal
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
technicians so we have a significant
 
04:23:12.189 --> 04:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
issue in retaining our trained uh
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
maintenance Force internally on the
 
04:23:17.790 --> 04:23:17.800 align:start position:0%
full-time side strictly because they may
 
04:23:20.229 --> 04:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
be able to go get a different job but
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
strict but be but simply because they
 
04:23:23.790 --> 04:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
are not eligible for those same
 
04:23:26.830 --> 04:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
reenlistment bonuses that's that their
 
04:23:30.229 --> 04:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
traditional uh Guardsmen are um eligible
 
04:23:32.469 --> 04:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
for so think of it like this we have
 
04:23:34.630 --> 04:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
four HR departments Human Resources
 
04:23:35.870 --> 04:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
departments one is for our state
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
civilian one is for the federal
 
04:23:39.309 --> 04:23:39.319 align:start position:0%
civilians one is for the Army one is for
 
04:23:41.550 --> 04:23:41.560 align:start position:0%
the Air Force right those Federal
 
04:23:42.790 --> 04:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
civilians can have a couple different
 
04:23:44.790 --> 04:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
statuses so that's I mean there's about
 
04:23:47.229 --> 04:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
a 100 people who are ineligible for a
 
04:23:50.550 --> 04:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
federal re uh retention bonus it's it's
 
04:23:54.590 --> 04:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:57.469 --> 04:23:57.479 align:start position:0%

pelum uh I'm introducing to nobody
 
04:27:04.429 --> 04:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
surprise an anti-war Bill uh HB 1338 a
 
04:27:06.309 --> 04:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
bill that with withholds state support
 
04:27:07.870 --> 04:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
for enforcement of Selective Service

time uh the withholding support section
 
04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
is modeled after other Sanctuary
 
04:27:27.670 --> 04:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
policies which I believe to be the duty
 
04:27:30.109 --> 04:27:30.119 align:start position:0%
of states to deny further expenditure of
 
04:27:32.550 --> 04:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money enforcing programs that
 
04:27:34.550 --> 04:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
federal government forces us uh forces
 
04:27:37.710 --> 04:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
upon us I did add a carve out to include
 
04:27:39.309 --> 04:27:39.319 align:start position:0%
the same language template from defend
 
04:27:41.109 --> 04:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
the guard unless war is formally
 
04:27:44.109 --> 04:27:44.119 align:start position:0%
declared pursuant to Article 1 Section 8
 
04:27:45.750 --> 04:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh which is probably nicer than I should
 
04:27:47.590 --> 04:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
be and uh some of the bill supporters
 
04:27:48.870 --> 04:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
would rather that language not be there
 
04:27:51.429 --> 04:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
at all uh removing the Selective Service
 
04:27:53.469 --> 04:27:53.479 align:start position:0%
awareness and compliance act uh was the
 
04:27:55.109 --> 04:27:55.119 align:start position:0%
original starting point for this bill
 
04:27:57.030 --> 04:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
since we currently have in statute a
 
04:27:59.389 --> 04:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
requirement that prospective college
 
04:28:01.429 --> 04:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
students be registered for the draft
 
04:28:02.910 --> 04:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
before they are admitted to State
 
04:28:05.309 --> 04:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
schools I find this unti entirely
 
04:28:07.070 --> 04:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
unnecessary in beyond the scope of what
 
04:28:09.149 --> 04:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
our college system should be enforcing
 
04:28:10.830 --> 04:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
if the feds care about it let them hand
 
04:28:12.910 --> 04:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
handle it via FASA or some other
 
04:28:15.109 --> 04:28:15.119 align:start position:0%
mechanism uh finally the conscientious
 
04:28:17.710 --> 04:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
objector check box I figured this was a
 
04:28:19.469 --> 04:28:19.479 align:start position:0%
straightforward way of flagging ahead of
 
04:28:21.030 --> 04:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
time that the next generation will not
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
comply with call-ups on an individual
 
04:28:25.070 --> 04:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
basis I was told the selective service
 
04:28:26.990 --> 04:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
system will not accept these which took
 
04:28:28.790 --> 04:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
me to by surprise because the federal
 
04:28:30.590 --> 04:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
government used used to enjoy
 
04:28:32.910 --> 04:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
warrantless bulk data collection and
 
04:28:34.229 --> 04:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
this information is voluntarily
 
04:28:36.429 --> 04:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
submitted uh regardless whether the feds
 
04:28:37.750 --> 04:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
will accept it I see no harm in
 
04:28:39.229 --> 04:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
providing an option of sending that
 
04:28:42.030 --> 04:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
information anyway I know esac
 
04:28:44.109 --> 04:28:44.119 align:start position:0%
unanimously opposes this bill I've been
 
04:28:45.590 --> 04:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
in attendance to their monthly meetings
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
and will continue to do so going forward
 
04:28:49.910 --> 04:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
a motivating factor for filing this and
 
04:28:52.070 --> 04:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
another bill was elicit elicit a
 
04:28:54.030 --> 04:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
response from them I wasn't completely
 
04:28:55.469 --> 04:28:55.479 align:start position:0%
surprised they opposed it but as a
 
04:28:57.269 --> 04:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
two-time combat veteran it continues to
 
04:28:58.630 --> 04:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
be disappointing that there are no
 
04:29:01.229 --> 04:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
anti-war veteran voices amongst svac
 
04:29:03.309 --> 04:29:03.319 align:start position:0%
voting members they simply do not
 
04:29:04.990 --> 04:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
represent me or an entire generation of
 
04:29:07.109 --> 04:29:07.119 align:start position:0%
veterans however the corrective measures
 
04:29:09.750 --> 04:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
via legislation are on the 2025 year
 
04:29:12.070 --> 04:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
we'll see what happens uh but as far as
 
04:29:15.030 --> 04:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh HB 1338 I hope uh you vote OTP and
 
04:29:17.830 --> 04:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to take any
 
04:29:22.229 --> 04:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
questions rep Cary so you mentioned that
 
04:29:26.389 --> 04:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
um in the public college system one must
 
04:29:28.510 --> 04:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
be registered in order to go to a public
 
04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
college is the same true private college
 
04:29:32.469 --> 04:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
I I believe it only affects the state
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
schools I I have to reread it but it
 
04:29:35.790 --> 04:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
actually I searched for the phrase
 
04:29:37.469 --> 04:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
Selective Service in RSA and that showed
 
04:29:39.229 --> 04:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
up and it was like you know it's been in
 
04:29:45.710 --> 04:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:51.070 --> 04:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:54.630 --> 04:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr chair um could you
 
04:29:57.389 --> 04:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
explain to me I'm a non-military person
 
04:30:00.590 --> 04:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
could you explain to me um lines 18 and
 
04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
19 of the bill yeah have let me bring it
 
04:30:06.750 --> 04:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
back up
 
04:30:08.750 --> 04:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
it says nothing in this chapter shall
 
04:30:11.429 --> 04:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
prohibit a government actor's entering
 
04:30:13.349 --> 04:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
of registrations with the selective
 
04:30:17.429 --> 04:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
service system as authorized by RSA
 
04:30:20.469 --> 04:30:20.479 align:start position:0%
20263 colon 5c so the information that
 
04:30:22.590 --> 04:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
you're filing when you check when we
 
04:30:24.269 --> 04:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
have our license registration there's a
 
04:30:26.429 --> 04:30:26.439 align:start position:0%
check box on there if you're like
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
younger you check it saying file this
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
information with the Selective Service I
 
04:30:31.870 --> 04:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
have an extra check box on there that
 
04:30:34.149 --> 04:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
simply says I'm I also wish to register
 
04:30:37.030 --> 04:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
as a um uh conscientious objector which
 
04:30:38.309 --> 04:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
I'm being told the selective service
 
04:30:40.030 --> 04:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
system won't accept it but I see no harm
 
04:30:42.269 --> 04:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
in sending them data the the federal
 
04:30:43.710 --> 04:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
government loves to collect our data I
 
04:30:44.630 --> 04:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
don't understand why they wouldn't
 
04:30:47.109 --> 04:30:47.119 align:start position:0%
accept this check box it seems like a
 
04:30:48.349 --> 04:30:48.359 align:start position:0%
dumb complaint from The Selective
 
04:30:48.359 --> 04:30:51.830 align:start position:0%
dumb complaint from The Selective
Service

04:30:51.830 --> 04:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:53.950 --> 04:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
System other questions for the prime
 
04:30:57.229 --> 04:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:59.870 --> 04:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
Sebert sorry thank you for taking my
 
04:31:02.670 --> 04:31:02.680 align:start position:0%
question um do you have what if you
 
04:31:06.070 --> 04:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
don't select the check box upon I might
 
04:31:07.429 --> 04:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
have missed that the first part The
 
04:31:08.910 --> 04:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
Selective Service that that's already
 
04:31:11.349 --> 04:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
like in RSA like u i mean not RSA that's
 
04:31:12.269 --> 04:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
already that's like a federal
 
04:31:14.309 --> 04:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
requirement that you're every abled body
 
04:31:15.790 --> 04:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
person is supposed to register for the
 
04:31:17.790 --> 04:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
draft well you're supposed to register
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
but if you're filling out your thing for
 
04:31:21.670 --> 04:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
your driver's license then you don't do
 
04:31:23.109 --> 04:31:23.119 align:start position:0%
the check box that's outside of the
 
04:31:24.349 --> 04:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
scope of what this bill is trying to do
 
04:31:25.750 --> 04:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's a that's a problem the
 
04:31:27.429 --> 04:31:27.439 align:start position:0%
federal government may have with you uh
 
04:31:28.950 --> 04:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
I do encourage people to not check that
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:34.560 --> 04:31:37.550 align:start position:0%
 
gotcha

04:31:37.550 --> 04:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
gotcha
 
04:31:40.630 --> 04:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
um you're good other questions for the
 
04:31:43.229 --> 04:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor repr fill you up it's
 
04:31:44.950 --> 04:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
unlikely you may have this data but what
 
04:31:47.109 --> 04:31:47.119 align:start position:0%
would be the percentage of people who
 
04:31:49.910 --> 04:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
would either fail to check the box or
 
04:31:52.030 --> 04:31:52.040 align:start position:0%
choose conscious objector do we have any
 
04:31:54.189 --> 04:31:54.199 align:start position:0%
data on that I'm not sure in the current
 
04:31:56.189 --> 04:31:56.199 align:start position:0%
state of affairs like uh I know for a
 
04:31:57.910 --> 04:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
fact uh there there's a Pew research
 
04:32:00.189 --> 04:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
poll about veterans specifically about
 
04:32:01.790 --> 04:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh individuals that think that the Iraq
 
04:32:04.349 --> 04:32:04.359 align:start position:0%
War was a mistake or I'm sorry not worth
 
04:32:06.870 --> 04:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
it so to speak only 33% of veterans
 
04:32:08.149 --> 04:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
thought that the Iraq War was a good
 
04:32:10.469 --> 04:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
idea and only 38% of Iraq and
 
04:32:12.750 --> 04:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan veterans thought that was a
 
04:32:14.269 --> 04:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
worth it and that was before the
 
04:32:15.870 --> 04:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
disastrous withdrawal so I guarantee
 
04:32:18.510 --> 04:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
that 38% is not the case anymore so that
 
04:32:20.550 --> 04:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
type of messaging should go forward I'm
 
04:32:22.630 --> 04:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
sure that it's bled out into the the the
 
04:32:24.189 --> 04:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
speaking with family members over turkey
 
04:32:25.750 --> 04:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
dinners and stuff like that like I've
 
04:32:30.670 --> 04:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:36.429 --> 04:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
04:32:38.750 --> 04:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
Manion I have two more cards here uh
 
04:32:40.910 --> 04:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative beler is here in support
 
04:32:44.910 --> 04:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill and uh Paul Mr Lloyd Paul
 
04:32:47.189 --> 04:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
Lloyd is still here uh from esvac
 
04:32:48.349 --> 04:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
opposing the bill those are the other
 
04:32:49.870 --> 04:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
two cards that I have if anyone else
 
04:32:52.830 --> 04:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
wants to submit a card they may so
 
04:32:55.990 --> 04:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:58.109 --> 04:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chair and members
 
04:33:00.830 --> 04:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee um I I was actually
 
04:33:01.950 --> 04:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
surprised to find that I wasn't a
 
04:33:03.830 --> 04:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this because I did assist
 
04:33:05.429 --> 04:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
with this bill and I am in favor of this
 
04:33:08.109 --> 04:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
bill um I would not actually identify
 
04:33:11.390 --> 04:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
myself as anti-war however I am not uh
 
04:33:14.390 --> 04:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
for fighting bad Wars for bad reasons
 
04:33:15.869 --> 04:33:15.879 align:start position:0%
and the way that we make sure we don't
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
fight bad Wars for bad reasons is we put
 
04:33:20.269 --> 04:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
that decision in the hands of the people
 
04:33:22.551 --> 04:33:22.561 align:start position:0%
representing the people themselves to
 
04:33:26.709 --> 04:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
make that decision um now we really need
 
04:33:26.719 --> 04:33:28.150 align:start position:0%
make that decision um now we really need
to

04:33:28.150 --> 04:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:33:30.830 --> 04:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
be uh we we need to understand our
 
04:33:33.310 --> 04:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
current circumstances as they exist
 
04:33:36.349 --> 04:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
right now geopolitically
 
04:33:38.830 --> 04:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh we're seeing what could reasonably be
 
04:33:40.949 --> 04:33:40.959 align:start position:0%
characterized as the opening phases of
 
04:33:43.949 --> 04:33:43.959 align:start position:0%
World War I we have fronts opened in
 
04:33:46.750 --> 04:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
Ukraine with Russia having invaded and
 
04:33:48.510 --> 04:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking at death tools over there
 
04:33:50.629 --> 04:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
with this new hyper lethal drone
 
04:33:53.590 --> 04:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
technology that are the last I heard
 
04:33:55.070 --> 04:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
they're approaching a million men
 
04:33:58.789 --> 04:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
between both armies we have possible
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
fronts opening in South America in
 
04:34:04.390 --> 04:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
Guyana with the perhaps invasion of
 
04:34:07.109 --> 04:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
Venezuela we have potential fronts
 
04:34:09.709 --> 04:34:09.719 align:start position:0%
opening soon with China that appears to
 
04:34:12.029 --> 04:34:12.039 align:start position:0%
be slated to move on Taiwan in the
 
04:34:13.869 --> 04:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
aftermath of an election that's due to
 
04:34:15.949 --> 04:34:15.959 align:start position:0%
happen this very week where the
 
04:34:17.629 --> 04:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
nationalists appear to look like they're
 
04:34:20.269 --> 04:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
going to carry Victory there so we need
 
04:34:21.629 --> 04:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
to be very clear about where we're
 
04:34:24.990 --> 04:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
headed as a country and as we enter this
 
04:34:27.910 --> 04:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily World historic dangerous
 
04:34:31.510 --> 04:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
time we also are at a nationally
 
04:34:33.709 --> 04:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
historic recruiting
 
04:34:36.990 --> 04:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
shortfall already we've heard from high
 
04:34:40.189 --> 04:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
up members of the military and uh
 
04:34:43.269 --> 04:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
civilian federal government that we will
 
04:34:45.470 --> 04:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
probably have to reinstitute a
 
04:34:47.949 --> 04:34:47.959 align:start position:0%
draft so we're talking about
 
04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
conscription if we have to go to war
 
04:34:52.429 --> 04:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
with any of these nations in fact I was
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
listening to some very good analysis
 
04:34:55.949 --> 04:34:55.959 align:start position:0%
this morning that suggested not for not
 
04:34:57.429 --> 04:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
even for lack of ships which we
 
04:34:59.150 --> 04:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
apparently don't have enough of but lack
 
04:35:02.109 --> 04:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
of personnel to staff ships that we
 
04:35:04.830 --> 04:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
probably don't even have the manpower to
 
04:35:04.840 --> 04:35:05.910 align:start position:0%
probably don't even have the manpower to
break

04:35:05.910 --> 04:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
break
 
04:35:08.990 --> 04:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
the likely blockade of Taiwan that is
 
04:35:10.510 --> 04:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
probably right around the
 
04:35:13.070 --> 04:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
corner so what's likely to happen in
 
04:35:16.029 --> 04:35:16.039 align:start position:0%
these circumstances is a draft again and
 
04:35:17.590 --> 04:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
all this is
 
04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
saying is that if we're going to take
 
04:35:22.470 --> 04:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
that extreme step where we're going to
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
send our boys and our girls into the
 
04:35:27.629 --> 04:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
brand new hyper lethal kind of warfare
 
04:35:29.429 --> 04:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing out of places like
 
04:35:31.670 --> 04:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
Ukraine that we actually have Congress
 
04:35:34.429 --> 04:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
take a vote on it thank you I'll take
 
04:35:34.439 --> 04:35:42.109 align:start position:0%
take a vote on it thank you I'll take
questions

04:35:42.109 --> 04:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:43.949 --> 04:35:43.959 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh Ron
 
04:35:47.670 --> 04:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
finny would you believe that since we've
 
04:35:49.990 --> 04:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
had an all volunteer Force for as long
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
as we've had now that isn't there a
 
04:35:54.590 --> 04:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
massive conflict with with federal
 
04:35:56.670 --> 04:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
government saying that you don't um
 
04:35:57.990 --> 04:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
you're not required to serve in the
 
04:35:59.949 --> 04:35:59.959 align:start position:0%
military but but you are required to
 
04:36:01.470 --> 04:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
basically sign up for the military
 
04:36:04.029 --> 04:36:04.039 align:start position:0%
through their system like like you know
 
04:36:05.470 --> 04:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
you know wouldn't we just make a you
 
04:36:08.429 --> 04:36:08.439 align:start position:0%
know conscription illegal
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
anyway so I'm I'm I'm of dual Minds on
 
04:36:13.189 --> 04:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
that I I understand the argument and
 
04:36:15.551 --> 04:36:15.561 align:start position:0%
perspective however I can also see an
 
04:36:18.349 --> 04:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
argument under a a truly existential
 
04:36:20.629 --> 04:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
threat such as an invasion of the
 
04:36:23.869 --> 04:36:23.879 align:start position:0%
Homeland by a considerable Force where
 
04:36:25.949 --> 04:36:25.959 align:start position:0%
it it could be a necessary thing and and
 
04:36:27.629 --> 04:36:27.639 align:start position:0%
from my perspective it could be a duty
 
04:36:30.629 --> 04:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
for any able-bodied person to to serve
 
04:36:33.029 --> 04:36:33.039 align:start position:0%
therein um assuming however they're not
 
04:36:34.709 --> 04:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
a conscience objector because we
 
04:36:36.230 --> 04:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
actually pretty pretty clear in the New
 
04:36:38.789 --> 04:36:38.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution that no conscien
 
04:36:45.789 --> 04:36:45.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:48.990 --> 04:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
Arms repres representative levit thank
 
04:36:51.189 --> 04:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
you chair MFA for taking my question so
 
04:36:53.349 --> 04:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
this is spin-off from the god bill
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
right uh I don't know if i' call it a
 
04:36:56.949 --> 04:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
spin-off some of it language is
 
04:36:58.709 --> 04:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
certainly inspired or well we're not
 
04:37:00.109 --> 04:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
going to argue with the term you know
 
04:37:01.949 --> 04:37:01.959 align:start position:0%
it's a term of endearing if you want to
 
04:37:03.750 --> 04:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
make look at it that way okay because
 
04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
you know I mean I'm service military so
 
04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
you know I been veteran but I mean where
 
04:37:10.869 --> 04:37:10.879 align:start position:0%
does it stop I mean I don't say this you
 
04:37:12.670 --> 04:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
know derogatorily I mean we're going to
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
have you know um the um
 
04:37:20.670 --> 04:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
um um the veter US Army Reserve next I
 
04:37:23.429 --> 04:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
mean it's we got to have some type of
 
04:37:26.109 --> 04:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
guidelines here and and I mean this I I
 
04:37:28.830 --> 04:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
need to know your position thank you
 
04:37:30.310 --> 04:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and a that's a very good
 
04:37:32.070 --> 04:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
question limiting principles are always
 
04:37:34.269 --> 04:37:34.279 align:start position:0%
very important so the limiting principle
 
04:37:36.349 --> 04:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
in this one is I I think fairly clearly
 
04:37:39.310 --> 04:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
outlined in the US Constitution which is
 
04:37:41.670 --> 04:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
that we should not be contri you know
 
04:37:44.150 --> 04:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
contributing troops to fight a foreign
 
04:37:47.109 --> 04:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
war save for an actual vote of Congress
 
04:37:48.310 --> 04:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
now this is something that hasn't
 
04:37:50.590 --> 04:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
actually happened since World War II
 
04:37:52.109 --> 04:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
because they've passed things like
 
04:37:53.869 --> 04:37:53.879 align:start position:0%
authorizations for the use of military
 
04:37:56.590 --> 04:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
force which are of questionable ultimate
 
04:37:59.470 --> 04:37:59.480 align:start position:0%
legality I think
 
04:38:01.629 --> 04:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
but that that's what the Constitution
 
04:38:02.949 --> 04:38:02.959 align:start position:0%
has to say so that's that's what I would
 
04:38:04.349 --> 04:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
say is is where we need to be going with
 
04:38:06.029 --> 04:38:06.039 align:start position:0%
this follow
 
04:38:06.039 --> 04:38:07.310 align:start position:0%
this follow
follow

04:38:07.310 --> 04:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
up what that's that's vague I mean you
 
04:38:14.830 --> 04:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
know you're say basically what you
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
interpret the Constitutions is saying I
 
04:38:20.230 --> 04:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
mean that's the truth of
 
04:38:23.230 --> 04:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
it U yes but I believe that's our job as
 
04:38:25.869 --> 04:38:25.879 align:start position:0%
a legislature to be coal the Federal
 
04:38:27.310 --> 04:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution you're saying that's our
 
04:38:28.990 --> 04:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
job as a legislator we serve the state
 
04:38:30.830 --> 04:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
not the
 
04:38:33.070 --> 04:38:33.080 align:start position:0%
bedroom well if I could just respond to
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
that that last point I I would say that
 
04:38:38.869 --> 04:38:38.879 align:start position:0%
um States created through our Federalist
 
04:38:40.750 --> 04:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
system the federal government to do the
 
04:38:43.189 --> 04:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
will of the states that couldn't be done
 
04:38:46.551 --> 04:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
individually by States and as a matter
 
04:38:50.029 --> 04:38:50.039 align:start position:0%
of a sort of co-ee equality all power is
 
04:38:52.189 --> 04:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
not strictly delegated to the federal
 
04:38:54.189 --> 04:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
government are reserved via the 10th
 
04:38:55.990 --> 04:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the states themselves which
 
04:38:59.189 --> 04:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
puts us relatively on par we're not
 
04:39:00.670 --> 04:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
we're not a sort of system where the
 
04:39:02.830 --> 04:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
federal government is above us they're
 
04:39:04.349 --> 04:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
just next to us and a little bit
 
04:39:06.670 --> 04:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
different than us so yes we do have the
 
04:39:09.109 --> 04:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
ability to um to push back a little bit
 
04:39:10.910 --> 04:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
if we believe they're making an error
 
04:39:12.869 --> 04:39:12.879 align:start position:0%
thank you for that explanation
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
sure uh representative I I do have a
 
04:39:17.910 --> 04:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
question uh for you or perhaps for the
 
04:39:21.189 --> 04:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor uh who I can ask because
 
04:39:24.109 --> 04:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
I'm the chair and I have that power uh
 
04:39:27.230 --> 04:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
and he's still here uh so as I read the
 
04:39:30.310 --> 04:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
analysis the bill prohibits state or
 
04:39:32.269 --> 04:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
local enforcement of the U Selective
 
04:39:34.150 --> 04:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
Service Act except in times of foreign
 
04:39:36.350 --> 04:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
military invasion of declared war
 
04:39:40.030 --> 04:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
so um so
 
04:39:43.910 --> 04:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
this me you I'll ask the prime again
 
04:39:48.190 --> 04:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
because I can um you're not favoring the
 
04:39:49.948 --> 04:39:49.958 align:start position:0%
elimination of the draft or The
 
04:39:53.150 --> 04:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
Selective Service or are you no it
 
04:39:54.910 --> 04:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're not I not no
 
04:39:58.868 --> 04:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
absolutely not and and Mr Prime sponsor
 
04:40:01.470 --> 04:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you because I can just for
 
04:40:03.470 --> 04:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
you're not the intent of this measure is
 
04:40:07.868 --> 04:40:07.878 align:start position:0%
not to eliminate the draft or or or
 
04:40:09.708 --> 04:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
advocate for the elimination of
 
04:40:12.270 --> 04:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
Selective Service you're it says it
 
04:40:14.910 --> 04:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
prohibits state or local enforcement so
 
04:40:17.990 --> 04:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
do you do do you support the elimination
 
04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the draft is I I personally do but
 
04:40:20.990 --> 04:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
this that's not what this bill is trying
 
04:40:22.708 --> 04:40:22.718 align:start position:0%
to do we can't do that there's Federal
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
uh Supremacy so the idea here is it's
 
04:40:27.628 --> 04:40:27.638 align:start position:0%
it's similar to all other um Sanctuary
 
04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
policies where we just won't expend like
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
State Police local police to help the
 
04:40:33.430 --> 04:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
feds apprehend draft Dodgers to speak
 
04:40:36.948 --> 04:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
okay got it thank thank you any other
 
04:40:39.350 --> 04:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative thank
 
04:40:42.430 --> 04:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr Lloyd is

hr21 house resolution 21 affirming the
 
04:42:32.230 --> 04:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:42:36.270 --> 04:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
militia Prime sponsor uh is here
 
04:42:37.430 --> 04:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
probably didn't know he was going to
 
04:42:39.270 --> 04:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
speak to the previous bill or maybe he
 
04:42:43.590 --> 04:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
did but uh here he is uh on schedule
 
04:42:47.430 --> 04:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
for introducing uh hr21 Prime sponsor
 
04:42:47.440 --> 04:42:55.788 align:start position:0%
for introducing uh hr21 Prime sponsor
representative

04:42:55.788 --> 04:42:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
beler thank you again Mr chairman and
 
04:43:00.830 --> 04:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
04:43:02.750 --> 04:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
committee and uh I don't know if I did
 
04:43:03.868 --> 04:43:03.878 align:start position:0%
this last time for the record
 
04:43:07.550 --> 04:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative vure Carol District
 
04:43:11.270 --> 04:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
4 um so I have a small packet going
 
04:43:12.510 --> 04:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
around that's got a few things we're
 
04:43:14.070 --> 04:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
going to take a quick look at if that's
 
04:43:17.670 --> 04:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
all right um the first page is my is my
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
testimony here today uh and it it opens
 
04:43:23.190 --> 04:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
with the portions from the New Hampshire
 
04:43:24.948 --> 04:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
Constitution the New Hampshire Bill of
 
04:43:27.270 --> 04:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
Rights that I believe are relevant to
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at
 
04:43:31.190 --> 04:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
today a well-regulated militia is the
 
04:43:33.990 --> 04:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
proper natural andure defense of a state
 
04:43:36.390 --> 04:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh article 24 you'll recognize that is
 
04:43:40.150 --> 04:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
the exact language you will find in the
 
04:43:43.550 --> 04:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
resolution it relates to uh article 25
 
04:43:44.910 --> 04:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
standing armies standing armies are
 
04:43:46.270 --> 04:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
dangerous to Liberty and ought not be
 
04:43:47.868 --> 04:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
raised or kept up without the consent of
 
04:43:47.878 --> 04:43:49.110 align:start position:0%
raised or kept up without the consent of
the

04:43:49.110 --> 04:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:43:52.550 --> 04:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
legislature and also to article 26 in
 
04:43:54.310 --> 04:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
all cases and at all times the military
 
04:43:55.990 --> 04:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
ought to be under strict subordination
 
04:43:58.750 --> 04:43:58.760 align:start position:0%
to and governed by the Civil
 
04:44:01.830 --> 04:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
power so these are all very important
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
things contextually to this proposed
 
04:44:06.590 --> 04:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
resolution tion um because we are
 
04:44:09.230 --> 04:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
talking about the state of New Hampshire
 
04:44:09.240 --> 04:44:10.670 align:start position:0%
talking about the state of New Hampshire
militia

04:44:10.670 --> 04:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
militia
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
here so why might we need a state of New
 
04:44:16.990 --> 04:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire militia now we already have
 
04:44:19.270 --> 04:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
one in theory and in law although I
 
04:44:21.070 --> 04:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
don't think there's any staffing of it
 
04:44:24.390 --> 04:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
at the moment but why might we need this
 
04:44:25.628 --> 04:44:25.638 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
04:44:27.948 --> 04:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
well we
 
04:44:30.750 --> 04:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
have Chinese military operations already
 
04:44:33.430 --> 04:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
occurring on us soil including drug
 
04:44:35.990 --> 04:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing distribution pipelines out
 
04:44:39.110 --> 04:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
of Maine BioWare biowarfare Research
 
04:44:40.788 --> 04:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
Laboratories out of
 
04:44:43.070 --> 04:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
California and an estimated division
 
04:44:45.670 --> 04:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
worth of soldiers already here that's
 
04:44:48.190 --> 04:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
from forward Observer group all of which
 
04:44:50.750 --> 04:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
can be turned to Insurgency and Guerilla
 
04:44:54.070 --> 04:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
Warfare operations on a moment's notice
 
04:44:57.948 --> 04:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
and are anticipated to do exactly that
 
04:45:00.270 --> 04:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
in the event of an American Chinese War
 
04:45:02.430 --> 04:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
which could very well PR be precipitated
 
04:45:06.510 --> 04:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:08.590 --> 04:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
second cartel activity including counter
 
04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
State operations drug distribution human
 
04:45:13.750 --> 04:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
trafficking and extreme violence the
 
04:45:16.110 --> 04:45:16.120 align:start position:0%
cartel is already the deao government
 
04:45:18.150 --> 04:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
Authority in multiple Southern border
 
04:45:20.948 --> 04:45:20.958 align:start position:0%
towns and has affected like the Chinese
 
04:45:23.470 --> 04:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
Communist Party Elite capture of
 
04:45:27.190 --> 04:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
Americans via bribery blackmail which
 
04:45:29.750 --> 04:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
can be reasonably forecast to lead to
 
04:45:32.310 --> 04:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
destabilization operations against the
 
04:45:34.270 --> 04:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
legitimate Republican government of the
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
several States as they have previously
 
04:45:38.628 --> 04:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
done in
 
04:45:40.990 --> 04:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
Mexico and another third reason
 
04:45:44.110 --> 04:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
infiltration of known malign actors and
 
04:45:46.510 --> 04:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
terrorists from such States as Russia
 
04:45:50.708 --> 04:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
China Iran Venezuela and more who are
 
04:45:53.350 --> 04:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
believed to be here to conduct agent
 
04:45:55.590 --> 04:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
sabator operations against critical
 
04:45:57.990 --> 04:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and as a note on that if
 
04:46:00.190 --> 04:46:00.200 align:start position:0%
anybody's been paying attention to this
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
um rather unlikely streak of exploding
 
04:46:06.868 --> 04:46:06.878 align:start position:0%
and burning pieces of American critical
 
04:46:10.350 --> 04:46:10.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure from refining capacity to
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
agriculture this might be something
 
04:46:14.550 --> 04:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
worth thinking a real hard look
 
04:46:17.110 --> 04:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
at so I would offer good members of the
 
04:46:19.110 --> 04:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
committee that we still require a
 
04:46:22.510 --> 04:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
militia today as much if not more so
 
04:46:24.070 --> 04:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
than we did at the founding of this
 
04:46:26.470 --> 04:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
nation we swore an oath before God to
 
04:46:29.030 --> 04:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
uphold this truth the militia is the
 
04:46:31.150 --> 04:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
shest and most proper defense of our
 
04:46:34.350 --> 04:46:34.360 align:start position:0%
state as is reasoned from natural law
 
04:46:35.948 --> 04:46:35.958 align:start position:0%
the right to self-defense and the right
 
04:46:35.958 --> 04:46:37.390 align:start position:0%
the right to self-defense and the right
to

04:46:37.390 --> 04:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:46:39.510 --> 04:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
self-determination now to offer some
 
04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
evidence and and pointers on this on the
 
04:46:44.990 --> 04:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
back of the first page we have a
 
04:46:47.628 --> 04:46:47.638 align:start position:0%
definition of the militia from federal
 
04:46:49.990 --> 04:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
law um which is important to note
 
04:46:52.510 --> 04:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
because the militia consists of all
 
04:46:54.670 --> 04:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
according to federal law all able-bodied
 
04:46:58.190 --> 04:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
males at lead 17 years of age and
 
04:47:00.830 --> 04:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
up now if we look to other conflicts in
 
04:47:02.670 --> 04:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
the world we might find that actually in
 
04:47:04.510 --> 04:47:04.520 align:start position:0%
terms of true existential credit say
 
04:47:06.230 --> 04:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
there is no person which the militia
 
04:47:09.030 --> 04:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
might not be expanded to
 
04:47:11.470 --> 04:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
Encompass it's also broken down into two
 
04:47:14.310 --> 04:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
categories the organized militia versus
 
04:47:16.788 --> 04:47:16.798 align:start position:0%
the unorganized militia there's a little
 
04:47:19.548 --> 04:47:19.558 align:start position:0%
bit of a debate on the organized part as
 
04:47:21.270 --> 04:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
to whether the National Guard is truly
 
04:47:23.030 --> 04:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
the militia of New Hampshire or the
 
04:47:24.230 --> 04:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
state guard is the militia of New
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for our purposes today we
 
04:47:27.270 --> 04:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about settling that
 
04:47:29.548 --> 04:47:29.558 align:start position:0%
conflict but it does
 
04:47:33.430 --> 04:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
exist next page this is the state guard
 
04:47:36.708 --> 04:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
as it exists in New Hampshire law this
 
04:47:40.190 --> 04:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
is at least a portion of the New
 
04:47:42.910 --> 04:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire organized militia it is under
 
04:47:44.990 --> 04:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
State Authority Under the authority of
 
04:47:45.000 --> 04:47:45.670 align:start position:0%
State Authority Under the authority of
the

04:47:45.670 --> 04:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:47.910 --> 04:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
governor currently as I said I don't
 
04:47:50.548 --> 04:47:50.558 align:start position:0%
believe it's staffed at the moment but
 
04:47:53.230 --> 04:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
it could be and it may be if we need to
 
04:47:55.030 --> 04:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
call it up at some point in
 
04:47:57.670 --> 04:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
time so if it's already here in law why
 
04:47:59.948 --> 04:47:59.958 align:start position:0%
do we even need a
 
04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
resolution moving on the state of

web the next two pages however the
Florida

04:48:25.830 --> 04:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
Florida
 
04:48:28.750 --> 04:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
guard when the Florida uh legislature
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
reinstituted their guard in
 
04:48:36.590 --> 04:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
2023 it was met with utter Fury and
 
04:48:40.150 --> 04:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
contempt from the federal government and
 
04:48:42.910 --> 04:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
from the media it was painted as a
 
04:48:45.948 --> 04:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
private Army it was painted as a
 
04:48:49.430 --> 04:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
vigilante militia and they made every
 
04:48:51.830 --> 04:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
effort they possibly could to shut this
 
04:48:55.430 --> 04:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
down and the end result was a severe
 
04:48:58.270 --> 04:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
limiting of the Staffing and capacity of
 
04:49:01.390 --> 04:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:03.628 --> 04:49:03.638 align:start position:0%
Florida that is the treatment we can
 
04:49:06.190 --> 04:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
expect effect if we find ourselves in
 
04:49:08.030 --> 04:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
the situation where we actually need to
 
04:49:12.310 --> 04:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:15.390 --> 04:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
reason and on the last page if you ask
 
04:49:18.470 --> 04:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
how timely is this bill well and I
 
04:49:19.990 --> 04:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
apologize because this didn't print well
 
04:49:22.110 --> 04:49:22.120 align:start position:0%
this is from Vice
 
04:49:24.708 --> 04:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
news and if you look at the
 
04:49:26.990 --> 04:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
date just
 
04:49:31.628 --> 04:49:31.638 align:start position:0%
yesterday the uh multiple congressmen at
 
04:49:34.190 --> 04:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
the federal level put a bill in that
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
would criminalize militia activity and
 
04:49:39.750 --> 04:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
as far as I can tell and I believe this
 
04:49:42.310 --> 04:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
is true that bill would criminalize the
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
training or calling up of the New
 
04:49:44.320 --> 04:49:45.948 align:start position:0%
training or calling up of the New
Hampshire

04:49:45.948 --> 04:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:49:50.548 --> 04:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
militia we as a state need to send a
 
04:49:52.750 --> 04:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
message to the federal
 
04:49:55.430 --> 04:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
government that they're encroaching on
 
04:49:58.190 --> 04:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
our state sovereignty here as I said
 
04:50:00.310 --> 04:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
before we are a dual Sovereign with the
 
04:50:02.310 --> 04:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
federal government it is right that the
 
04:50:04.190 --> 04:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
federal government have an army to
 
04:50:07.070 --> 04:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
protect us and from Invasion and it's
 
04:50:09.830 --> 04:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
also right that each state under its own
 
04:50:12.150 --> 04:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
Sovereign Authority control its own
 
04:50:15.470 --> 04:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
military to its own necessary ends that
 
04:50:17.270 --> 04:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
will vary from state to state and they
 
04:50:19.708 --> 04:50:19.718 align:start position:0%
look different from state to state
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:28.548 --> 04:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
04:50:31.030 --> 04:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
finny would you I don't know if it's
 
04:50:33.070 --> 04:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
more of a would you believe but do you
 
04:50:33.080 --> 04:50:34.430 align:start position:0%
more of a would you believe but do you
believe

04:50:34.430 --> 04:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:50:37.548 --> 04:50:37.558 align:start position:0%
from your own perspective that um the
 
04:50:40.270 --> 04:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
more like uh demonization of militias
 
04:50:41.590 --> 04:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the country not just in New
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has has something to do with
 
04:50:47.230 --> 04:50:47.240 align:start position:0%
the perceived idea that an organized
 
04:50:49.110 --> 04:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
group of civilians would somehow be able
 
04:50:51.868 --> 04:50:51.878 align:start position:0%
to overthrow the government or it's it's
 
04:50:55.430 --> 04:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
more of a secession thing or or it's a
 
04:50:57.548 --> 04:50:57.558 align:start position:0%
pretense to armed conflict with our own
 
04:51:00.430 --> 04:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
people would you believe that you know I
 
04:51:01.948 --> 04:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
think the demonization that has occurred
 
04:51:04.390 --> 04:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
around the militia concept has I think
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
it largely had to do with the veering
 
04:51:07.948 --> 04:51:07.958 align:start position:0%
away from the founders intent of the
 
04:51:10.190 --> 04:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
militia concept that occurred during
 
04:51:12.270 --> 04:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps the the mid part of the 20th
 
04:51:16.830 --> 04:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
century um where we saw if I'm honest a
 
04:51:19.990 --> 04:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
lot of yahoos and places who were kind
 
04:51:24.190 --> 04:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
of play acting or laring as soldiers who
 
04:51:26.590 --> 04:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
got some dangerous ideas in their heads
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
um but the reality is from the from the
 
04:51:31.030 --> 04:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
instantiation of this nation the militia
 
04:51:32.708 --> 04:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
has been considered the militia under
 
04:51:34.270 --> 04:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
the state control
 
04:51:35.670 --> 04:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
which consists of the whole body of the
 
04:51:37.070 --> 04:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
people because if you remember the
 
04:51:38.910 --> 04:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
concept of the Minute Men the idea was
 
04:51:42.670 --> 04:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
that that all men of of due age were to
 
04:51:47.548 --> 04:51:47.558 align:start position:0%
keep a musket powder balls and the
 
04:51:50.150 --> 04:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
training they needed to put them into
 
04:51:52.510 --> 04:51:52.520 align:start position:0%
effect rapidly to protect their
 
04:51:54.230 --> 04:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
communities and their state and their
 
04:51:57.190 --> 04:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
country and that is the militia concept
 
04:52:02.628 --> 04:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:05.230 --> 04:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
04:52:09.590 --> 04:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
levit thank you chair Mett it's just one
 
04:52:13.670 --> 04:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:16.190 --> 04:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
and I I understand what you're saying
 
04:52:17.628 --> 04:52:17.638 align:start position:0%
and where you're coming from here I
 
04:52:20.430 --> 04:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
sincerely do just the word a militia and
 
04:52:22.150 --> 04:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get a debate it does
 
04:52:24.270 --> 04:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
not have good following but why wouldn't
 
04:52:28.070 --> 04:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
I call up a highly trained highly
 
04:52:30.788 --> 04:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
weaponized highly organized
 
04:52:33.310 --> 04:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
organizations such as the New Hampshire
 
04:52:35.910 --> 04:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
National guard instead I'm not I don't
 
04:52:37.990 --> 04:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
mean derogatory instead of Joey down the
 
04:52:40.110 --> 04:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
road say hey call him up buddy we better
 
04:52:41.990 --> 04:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
get going here they're invading us it
 
04:52:43.990 --> 04:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
makes no sense thank you well I I
 
04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I'm actually very glad
 
04:52:47.070 --> 04:52:47.080 align:start position:0%
you asked that because that's something
 
04:52:49.150 --> 04:52:49.160 align:start position:0%
I should have touched on so there's
 
04:52:50.628 --> 04:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
there's two reasons that really stand
 
04:52:52.910 --> 04:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
out and if you look at the actual State
 
04:52:55.030 --> 04:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
Guard law which is on the page number
 
04:52:57.670 --> 04:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
three um what it does is it gives the
 
04:53:00.430 --> 04:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
governor the authority to create this
 
04:53:04.070 --> 04:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
callup Force this organized militia
 
04:53:05.750 --> 04:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
under circumstances where a National
 
04:53:06.750 --> 04:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
Guard are
 
04:53:09.150 --> 04:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
deployed so when they're not
 
04:53:11.830 --> 04:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
available this is the
 
04:53:13.990 --> 04:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
go-to the second
 
04:53:16.948 --> 04:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
reason is that the National Guard and
 
04:53:18.190 --> 04:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
this is that little bit of a debate I
 
04:53:20.110 --> 04:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
didn't want to get into is whether the
 
04:53:21.590 --> 04:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
National Guard actually is the militia
 
04:53:23.670 --> 04:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
or not it's defined as so under federal
 
04:53:25.788 --> 04:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
statute but it's a little less clear in
 
04:53:25.798 --> 04:53:27.230 align:start position:0%
statute but it's a little less clear in
state

04:53:27.230 --> 04:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:53:29.750 --> 04:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
law but the federal government has the
 
04:53:32.310 --> 04:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
ability to activate the National
 
04:53:36.470 --> 04:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
Guard so so what were to happen if say
 
04:53:38.230 --> 04:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
just as actually we're about to get a
 
04:53:40.830 --> 04:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
very good example of this in Texas
 
04:53:43.628 --> 04:53:43.638 align:start position:0%
yesterday the uh the governor of Texas
 
04:53:46.868 --> 04:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
Greg Abbott called up his National Guard
 
04:53:50.230 --> 04:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
to duty in the context of a militia and
 
04:53:52.990 --> 04:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
he actually took over a uh a section of
 
04:53:56.110 --> 04:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
the border and he expelled uh Federal
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
border patrol and he declared that
 
04:53:59.910 --> 04:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
Federal Border Patrol was actually
 
04:54:02.230 --> 04:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
assisting with an invasion force of the
 
04:54:04.590 --> 04:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
United States so so we have a situation
 
04:54:07.470 --> 04:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
here where there is the potential for a
 
04:54:09.948 --> 04:54:09.958 align:start position:0%
conflict between state and federal about
 
04:54:12.230 --> 04:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
who is in control of this
 
04:54:15.030 --> 04:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
organization and the militia concept is
 
04:54:16.948 --> 04:54:16.958 align:start position:0%
really ultimately designed to eliminate
 
04:54:19.470 --> 04:54:19.480 align:start position:0%
any doubt about who's in control of the
 
04:54:22.910 --> 04:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
organization so where the National Guard
 
04:54:24.750 --> 04:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
can be called up at the federal level
 
04:54:27.708 --> 04:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
and can be federalized the state militia
 
04:54:32.070 --> 04:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:35.830 --> 04:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:38.910 --> 04:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
explanation uh so represent Belcher uh I
 
04:54:42.110 --> 04:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
actually wrote down what you said uh
 
04:54:43.750 --> 04:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
federal government has the ability to
 
04:54:45.310 --> 04:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
activate the National
 
04:54:47.750 --> 04:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
Guard um it's interesting because we had
 
04:54:50.590 --> 04:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
to defend the guard bill that kind of uh
 
04:54:53.990 --> 04:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
goes to that uh notion or that statement
 
04:54:56.350 --> 04:54:56.360 align:start position:0%
that you just made about federal
 
04:54:57.628 --> 04:54:57.638 align:start position:0%
government has the ability to activate
 
04:55:00.868 --> 04:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
the National Guard uh if there's a
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
declaration of war that that's uh
 
04:55:06.110 --> 04:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
something that we're getting there's a
 
04:55:08.788 --> 04:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
lot of civics being learned uh thanks to
 
04:55:11.628 --> 04:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
these guard bills and militia bills uh a
 
04:55:13.990 --> 04:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
lot of people as the guard bill was
 
04:55:16.750 --> 04:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
being discussed they confused the guard
 
04:55:19.590 --> 04:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
with the militia what you're doing here
 
04:55:22.868 --> 04:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
is is useful I I think for sure it's
 
04:55:24.628 --> 04:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
helping it will help people understand
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
the difference there is a difference so
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
my my question is uh I I'm looking what
 
04:55:35.110 --> 04:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
you have out of FL Florida um which is
 
04:55:38.270 --> 04:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
very interesting um there's 48 other
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
states and you mentioned Texas as well
 
04:55:42.750 --> 04:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
can you point to any other states that
 
04:55:46.230 --> 04:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
have this dual guard militia structure
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
in place uh where the militia clearly is
 
04:55:52.310 --> 04:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
not under the purview of the feds and
 
04:55:53.830 --> 04:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
the National Guard we're we're still
 
04:55:55.230 --> 04:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
talking about that is there any state
 
04:55:56.350 --> 04:55:56.360 align:start position:0%
that has that
 
04:55:59.070 --> 04:55:59.080 align:start position:0%
duel there there is I'm struggling to
 
04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
remember the third state that has a
 
04:56:02.270 --> 04:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
there is a third state that has a
 
04:56:03.910 --> 04:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
specifically outlined in the law
 
04:56:05.390 --> 04:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
I I don't I'll have to get back to you
 
04:56:07.470 --> 04:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
on which state that is but you're
 
04:56:09.910 --> 04:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
getting that very well could be um but
 
04:56:11.628 --> 04:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
you're you're getting into also a very
 
04:56:14.510 --> 04:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
important sort of um sort of line of
 
04:56:17.350 --> 04:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
thought here about whether or not a the
 
04:56:19.190 --> 04:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
militia concept has to be defined in
 
04:56:23.070 --> 04:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
state law because a lot of States would
 
04:56:25.270 --> 04:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
not specifically necessarily have it in
 
04:56:27.868 --> 04:56:27.878 align:start position:0%
RSA or in their state law because they
 
04:56:29.470 --> 04:56:29.480 align:start position:0%
have Illusions to it in their
 
04:56:31.270 --> 04:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
constitution and it's also within the
 
04:56:31.280 --> 04:56:32.270 align:start position:0%
constitution and it's also within the
Federal

04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
04:56:35.070 --> 04:56:35.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution so every state since the
 
04:56:38.548 --> 04:56:38.558 align:start position:0%
Inception of America has had access to
 
04:56:40.708 --> 04:56:40.718 align:start position:0%
its own because they are sovereign
 
04:56:42.110 --> 04:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
basically the definition of a sovereign
 
04:56:43.390 --> 04:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
might as well be you get your own
 
04:56:46.510 --> 04:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
military force um so that's just been
 
04:56:48.070 --> 04:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
the way it has been ever since the
 
04:56:50.868 --> 04:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
foundations of this
 
04:56:55.430 --> 04:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
country if followup uh if if a militia
 
04:56:59.070 --> 04:56:59.080 align:start position:0%
on the state level is better defined um
 
04:57:02.150 --> 04:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
do you see a possibility of of a county
 
04:57:04.590 --> 04:57:04.600 align:start position:0%
wanting to organize some sort of a
 
04:57:04.600 --> 04:57:06.030 align:start position:0%
wanting to organize some sort of a
county

04:57:06.030 --> 04:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
county
 
04:57:09.390 --> 04:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
militia uh that that's going to heavily
 
04:57:12.510 --> 04:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
depend on what is in state law now there
 
04:57:14.510 --> 04:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
are places I believe in this country
 
04:57:17.350 --> 04:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
where such a thing would be um would be
 
04:57:20.830 --> 04:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
within the scope of their state law as
 
04:57:22.830 --> 04:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
or the Constitution that's laid out
 
04:57:25.150 --> 04:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire however there is no
 
04:57:28.230 --> 04:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
such um there is no such standard it's
 
04:57:31.628 --> 04:57:31.638 align:start position:0%
very clear in New Hampshire law that the
 
04:57:33.628 --> 04:57:33.638 align:start position:0%
militia is under the control control of
 
04:57:36.670 --> 04:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
the state not not a county level
 
04:57:38.628 --> 04:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
Authority the closest thing you could
 
04:57:40.590 --> 04:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
possibly get to at the county level is a
 
04:57:42.310 --> 04:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
is a is a policy that would be set up by
 
04:57:45.230 --> 04:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
a sheriff sure there you go and you you
 
04:57:47.590 --> 04:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
provided us some great uh background
 
04:57:49.788 --> 04:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
with the actual articles that speak to
 
04:57:52.708 --> 04:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
that any other questions for represent
 
04:57:54.190 --> 04:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
beler yes represent
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
Miller thank you Mr chair um in your
 
04:58:00.390 --> 04:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
resolution you mentioned asymmetric
 
04:58:02.910 --> 04:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
threats could you define what that means
 
04:58:07.590 --> 04:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
yes so asymmetric threats is is a phrase
 
04:58:10.230 --> 04:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
that comes from unconventional warfare
 
04:58:12.190 --> 04:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
and it basically it just means if you if
 
04:58:13.270 --> 04:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
you look for instance at what's
 
04:58:16.190 --> 04:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
currently happening over in um well
 
04:58:17.670 --> 04:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
actually we launched a bunch of missiles
 
04:58:20.510 --> 04:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
at uh Targets in Yemen last night at at
 
04:58:23.110 --> 04:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
the federal level now what was happening
 
04:58:26.830 --> 04:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
was they the Yemen were launching
 
04:58:29.390 --> 04:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
relatively inexpensive Iranian Source
 
04:58:33.430 --> 04:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
drone technology at commercial shipping
 
04:58:37.430 --> 04:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
and at our military vessels um and those
 
04:58:39.230 --> 04:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
things were they're cheap they're you
 
04:58:41.590 --> 04:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
know thousands of dollars each and we
 
04:58:43.310 --> 04:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
had to shoot each one of them down with
 
04:58:45.230 --> 04:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
missiles that cost more than millions of
 
04:58:48.750 --> 04:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
dollars each so the asymmetry in that
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
threat is something that is thought of
 
04:58:54.350 --> 04:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
in unconventional warfare terms as a
 
04:58:56.150 --> 04:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
GameChanger it's something that we
 
04:58:57.910 --> 04:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
cannot keep up in the long term because
 
04:58:59.788 --> 04:58:59.798 align:start position:0%
it would either bleed us dry financially
 
04:59:02.310 --> 04:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
or we would run out of these expensive
 
04:59:04.830 --> 04:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
things so asymmetric threats are things
 
04:59:07.788 --> 04:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
that are not they're not traditional
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
Warfare they're things that exploit uh
 
04:59:15.470 --> 04:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities um inexpensive uh newer
 
04:59:18.628 --> 04:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
Technologies um and they would even grow
 
04:59:22.910 --> 04:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
to Encompass things like um
 
04:59:25.990 --> 04:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
um the the sort of Special Forces type
 
04:59:28.910 --> 04:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
operations that are conducted by various
 
04:59:31.030 --> 04:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
countries on other Count's soil in order
 
04:59:36.430 --> 04:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:39.948 --> 04:59:39.958 align:start position:0%
that thank you for that other questions
 
04:59:41.628 --> 04:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
R of
 
04:59:44.750 --> 04:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
kry so just based on the testimony we've
 
04:59:47.470 --> 04:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
heard today about you know other bills
 
04:59:50.230 --> 04:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
where there's such difficulty recruiting
 
04:59:53.030 --> 04:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
and now we're offering big bonuses and
 
04:59:55.830 --> 04:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
incentives to get people to join how do
 
04:59:58.310 --> 04:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
you think a state militia might be
 
05:00:00.910 --> 05:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
peopled if we're having this much
 
05:00:03.910 --> 05:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
difficulty with our traditional services
 
05:00:05.310 --> 05:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
that's a good question but I don't think
 
05:00:08.150 --> 05:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
they're directly related because the
 
05:00:10.868 --> 05:00:10.878 align:start position:0%
unorganized militia is already defined
 
05:00:13.030 --> 05:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
it it is essentially the entire body of
 
05:00:14.750 --> 05:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
the people who is capable of wielding
 
05:00:19.190 --> 05:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
arms um which is why the militia is only
 
05:00:22.470 --> 05:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
utilized as typically in true
 
05:00:25.510 --> 05:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
existential threats um for instance you
 
05:00:27.750 --> 05:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
Ukraine has been invaded by Russia and
 
05:00:30.310 --> 05:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
they have now dipped into deep into the
 
05:00:31.948 --> 05:00:31.958 align:start position:0%
barrel to pull everyone they possibly
 
05:00:34.990 --> 05:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
can out to defend the Homeland uh that's
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
the sort of circumstance where you see a
 
05:00:40.110 --> 05:00:40.120 align:start position:0%
militia uh being employed uh or
 
05:00:42.510 --> 05:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
alternatively here in the US our
 
05:00:46.628 --> 05:00:46.638 align:start position:0%
military size is such that if we had if
 
05:00:49.510 --> 05:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
we had these known uh Bad actors who
 
05:00:50.788 --> 05:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
were all over the country who are you
 
05:00:52.750 --> 05:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
know foreign military aged males from
 
05:00:54.750 --> 05:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
various countries that don't like us if
 
05:00:56.350 --> 05:00:56.360 align:start position:0%
they had a protracted unconventional
 
05:00:58.788 --> 05:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
warfare threat where they targeted our
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
critical infrastructure choke points
 
05:01:04.310 --> 05:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
Logistics the there is no possible way
 
05:01:06.310 --> 05:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
that with the size of our military we
 
05:01:08.708 --> 05:01:08.718 align:start position:0%
could keep this entire country safe and
 
05:01:10.990 --> 05:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
that's where this decentralized uh
 
05:01:12.110 --> 05:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
concept of
 
05:01:15.230 --> 05:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
militia um both within state law and the
 
05:01:16.590 --> 05:01:16.600 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution in the Second
 
05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's where that
 
05:01:20.310 --> 05:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
decentralized capability comes from
 
05:01:21.990 --> 05:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
where if something like that were to
 
05:01:24.350 --> 05:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
happen and we were getting hit all over
 
05:01:26.190 --> 05:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
the country and we didn't have the
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
Personnel to respond with the
 
05:01:30.590 --> 05:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
professional military we would need
 
05:01:32.310 --> 05:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
things like the state militia we would
 
05:01:35.310 --> 05:01:35.320 align:start position:0%
need things like sherff
 
05:01:37.868 --> 05:01:37.878 align:start position:0%
posies could I just follow up follow how
 
05:01:40.670 --> 05:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
do we I mean how would we be trained so
 
05:01:42.750 --> 05:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
essentially it's a draft right we're
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
drafted into the state mil militia and
 
05:01:48.230 --> 05:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
then how we're not
 
05:01:52.788 --> 05:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
trained it's it's not strictly a draft
 
05:01:55.470 --> 05:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's more of a callup and because
 
05:01:56.510 --> 05:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
this is under the New Hampshire
 
05:01:58.230 --> 05:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution the ability to withdraw
 
05:02:00.708 --> 05:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
based on um con change objector status
 
05:02:03.430 --> 05:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
would still apply um but how they would
 
05:02:04.910 --> 05:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
be trained well that's a very good
 
05:02:06.868 --> 05:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
question now it's identified that the
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
unorganized militia exists of all
 
05:02:11.708 --> 05:02:11.718 align:start position:0%
able-bodied people in in the founders
 
05:02:13.510 --> 05:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
time the revolutionary period we had
 
05:02:15.070 --> 05:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
things like the Minuteman we had people
 
05:02:18.350 --> 05:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
who kept themselves trained and ready in
 
05:02:20.030 --> 05:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
case they needed to be called in the
 
05:02:21.788 --> 05:02:21.798 align:start position:0%
service by their Community or by their
 
05:02:24.628 --> 05:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
country today it's not exactly the same
 
05:02:26.270 --> 05:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
but we certainly have things like Sig
 
05:02:29.390 --> 05:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
sour Academy we have police officers who
 
05:02:31.948 --> 05:02:31.958 align:start position:0%
are trained for such tasks we have
 
05:02:34.350 --> 05:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
people with the skills necessary and
 
05:02:35.708 --> 05:02:35.718 align:start position:0%
they continue to need to be able to
 
05:02:38.230 --> 05:02:38.240 align:start position:0%
build those skills necessary that if
 
05:02:39.788 --> 05:02:39.798 align:start position:0%
they are ever needed in such a
 
05:02:41.590 --> 05:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
circumstance that the state can count on
 
05:02:44.590 --> 05:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
them in the event of a call
 
05:02:49.230 --> 05:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:51.110 --> 05:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you representative
 
05:02:53.270 --> 05:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
beler I have a card here from Warren
 
05:02:56.030 --> 05:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
Perry who is here he's not representing
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
esvac but when he sits down he can uh
 
05:03:02.110 --> 05:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
explain to the clerk uh who he is
 
05:03:02.120 --> 05:03:05.670 align:start position:0%
explain to the clerk uh who he is
representing

05:03:05.670 --> 05:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:07.910 --> 05:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Perry thank you Mr chair
 
05:03:09.150 --> 05:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Warren Perry
 
05:03:10.350 --> 05:03:10.360 align:start position:0%
I'm the deputy Adent general for the
 
05:03:11.510 --> 05:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
05:03:13.430 --> 05:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
veteran services I work
 
05:03:16.868 --> 05:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
foror General Dave mtis I just wanted to
 
05:03:19.670 --> 05:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
make I heard one part of the honorable
 
05:03:21.110 --> 05:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative's testimony just wanted
 
05:03:24.830 --> 05:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
to be clear that the National Guard in
 
05:03:27.510 --> 05:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
State statue is defined as a militia so
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
if you go to 110b
 
05:03:33.708 --> 05:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
1A uh it says the the statute reads the
 
05:03:35.110 --> 05:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
militia shall be divided into three
 
05:03:38.310 --> 05:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
classes namely the National Guard the
 
05:03:40.708 --> 05:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
state guard and the unorganized militia
 
05:03:43.628 --> 05:03:43.638 align:start position:0%
so the statute is very clear that it is
 
05:03:45.910 --> 05:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
part of the militia New Hampshire
 
05:03:49.990 --> 05:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
statute is very clear so I just want to
 
05:03:51.910 --> 05:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
Mr could you could you repeat that
 
05:03:53.548 --> 05:03:53.558 align:start position:0%
article just so I can make a note of it
 
05:03:56.190 --> 05:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
it's 110 B1
 
05:04:01.230 --> 05:04:01.240 align:start position:0%
110-b colon Das a composition of the
 
05:04:04.590 --> 05:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
militia so other parts of the statute
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
just for if if you'll allow me to be
 
05:04:10.868 --> 05:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
clear chapter uh 110 or RSA one I'm
 
05:04:16.670 --> 05:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
sorry 111 defines and uh uh outlines the
 
05:04:18.990 --> 05:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
role of the state guard which is one
 
05:04:21.548 --> 05:04:21.558 align:start position:0%
another of the three parts and then the
 
05:04:23.990 --> 05:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
unorganized militia is as defined by the
 
05:04:26.030 --> 05:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative who preceded me the
 
05:04:28.430 --> 05:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
able-bodied men over the able-bodied
 
05:04:32.190 --> 05:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
residents it doesn't say men so thank
 
05:04:33.910 --> 05:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
you so much for that clarification
 
05:04:36.350 --> 05:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
that's very helpful um would you take
 
05:04:39.310 --> 05:04:39.320 align:start position:0%

does anyone have any questions for uh
 
05:04:41.440 --> 05:04:43.868 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions for uh
the

05:04:43.868 --> 05:04:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:48.470 --> 05:04:48.480 align:start position:0%

05:04:54.270 --> 05:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
with no one else appearing interested in
 
05:04:56.230 --> 05:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
speaking to this measure I
 
05:04:59.910 --> 05:04:59.920 align:start position:0%

representative of Wendy Thomas and I
 
05:05:37.110 --> 05:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
serve the town of marac Hillsboro uh
 
05:05:40.030 --> 05:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
District 12 I've been a resident of the
 
05:05:43.310 --> 05:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
town for 33 years we have six children
 
05:05:44.830 --> 05:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
that were raised in
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
marac um I also have a degree in medical
 
05:05:49.788 --> 05:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
biology and have worked as a clinical
 
05:05:51.910 --> 05:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
microbiologist that information will
 
05:05:55.510 --> 05:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
come in uh in later I am one of the
 
05:05:59.548 --> 05:05:59.558 align:start position:0%
water Warriors who have been ringing or
 
05:06:03.270 --> 05:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh ringing the past Bell since 20 2016
 
05:06:03.280 --> 05:06:04.150 align:start position:0%
uh ringing the past Bell since 20 2016
in

05:06:04.150 --> 05:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:06:07.868 --> 05:06:07.878 align:start position:0%
marac I'm introducing house resolution
 
05:06:13.590 --> 05:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
28 which if you look has triartisan
 
05:06:15.670 --> 05:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
support so there's going to be three
 
05:06:18.230 --> 05:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
parts to my presentation and I know it's
 
05:06:19.990 --> 05:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
been a long day and I'm sorry and I'll
 
05:06:21.548 --> 05:06:21.558 align:start position:0%
try to work through it as quickly as I
 
05:06:23.470 --> 05:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
can but there's a lot of information
 
05:06:25.510 --> 05:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
here I'm going to talk about the
 
05:06:27.270 --> 05:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
resolution I'm going to tell you why we
 
05:06:28.830 --> 05:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
need the resolution and then I'm going
 
05:06:30.868 --> 05:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
to bring you down to a micro level of
 
05:06:32.628 --> 05:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
what it what it's like to live in in a
 
05:06:34.868 --> 05:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
past contaminated
 
05:06:37.990 --> 05:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
town so if you look at the house
 
05:06:40.868 --> 05:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
resolution um in lines one and two we
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
talk about past chemicals when I there's
 
05:06:47.230 --> 05:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
going to be two specific P past
 
05:06:49.548 --> 05:06:49.558 align:start position:0%
chemicals that I'll talk to about later
 
05:06:51.948 --> 05:06:51.958 align:start position:0%
I'll reference but when I talk about
 
05:06:53.948 --> 05:06:53.958 align:start position:0%
past chemicals I'm actually talking
 
05:06:56.510 --> 05:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
about a class of over
 
05:07:00.670 --> 05:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
14,000 chemicals so uh it's not just an
 
05:07:03.868 --> 05:07:03.878 align:start position:0%
individual thing
 
05:07:06.750 --> 05:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh in my town There's a high incidence
 
05:07:09.750 --> 05:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
of cancer medical monitoring costs and
 
05:07:12.830 --> 05:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
water and environmental
 
05:07:16.030 --> 05:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
damage the the the corporation that has
 
05:07:18.990 --> 05:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
done this is called St gobain originally
 
05:07:22.868 --> 05:07:22.878 align:start position:0%
they located in Bennington Vermont and
 
05:07:25.270 --> 05:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
they they housed a Plastics facility
 
05:07:27.868 --> 05:07:27.878 align:start position:0%
there contaminated did exactly what they
 
05:07:29.628 --> 05:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
did in New Hampshire contaminated the
 
05:07:32.590 --> 05:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
town contaminated the water contaminated
 
05:07:32.600 --> 05:07:33.350 align:start position:0%
town contaminated the water contaminated
the

05:07:33.350 --> 05:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:07:36.270 --> 05:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
soil then they decided Vermont kicked
 
05:07:38.708 --> 05:07:38.718 align:start position:0%
them out uh they decided to go to HK
 
05:07:42.030 --> 05:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
Falls in New York state they this is
 
05:07:43.670 --> 05:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to sound familiar they
 
05:07:45.990 --> 05:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
contaminated the water they contaminated
 
05:07:48.470 --> 05:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
the soil they contaminated the
 
05:07:52.470 --> 05:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
air uh both
 
05:07:55.030 --> 05:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh both of those let me see if I can
 
05:07:58.868 --> 05:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh both states have sued Sano
 
05:08:07.750 --> 05:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh for damages and um I'll have to find
 
05:08:10.470 --> 05:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
I'll have to find the the number but um
 
05:08:12.430 --> 05:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
billions billions of dollars to each of
 
05:08:15.670 --> 05:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:18.750 --> 05:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
remediation so sanco Bain has announced
 
05:08:20.868 --> 05:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
that they're going to leave marac uh
 
05:08:24.548 --> 05:08:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:27.548 --> 05:08:27.558 align:start position:0%
2024 what does this mean for our town I
 
05:08:30.190 --> 05:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
mean we have these forever chemicals and
 
05:08:31.350 --> 05:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
the reason they're called Forever
 
05:08:33.910 --> 05:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
chemicals is the the chemical bond is so
 
05:08:36.990 --> 05:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
strong it's not broken in nature there
 
05:08:38.990 --> 05:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
are it can be broken under high
 
05:08:41.910 --> 05:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
temperature uh situations but once it
 
05:08:44.590 --> 05:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
escapes into the wild you cannot get rid
 
05:08:45.708 --> 05:08:45.718 align:start position:0%
of these
 
05:08:48.430 --> 05:08:48.440 align:start position:0%
chemicals uh so there it's been causing
 
05:08:52.030 --> 05:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
all kinds of problems in my town um
 
05:08:54.190 --> 05:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
Senco ban is currently in discussion
 
05:08:57.788 --> 05:08:57.798 align:start position:0%
with Dees about closing down the
 
05:09:01.750 --> 05:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
Plant um however there are problems with
 
05:09:01.760 --> 05:09:02.670 align:start position:0%
Plant um however there are problems with
S

05:09:02.670 --> 05:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
S
 
05:09:06.190 --> 05:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
because they continually lie and I don't
 
05:09:09.670 --> 05:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
say that lightly um I will give you some
 
05:09:12.750 --> 05:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
some instances of their constant
 
05:09:16.990 --> 05:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
lying um s Cain said that they did not
 
05:09:22.110 --> 05:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
use uh full strength pooa 100% pooa
 
05:09:25.708 --> 05:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
chemicals when um they approached Dees
 
05:09:25.718 --> 05:09:28.110 align:start position:0%
chemicals when um they approached Dees
in

05:09:28.110 --> 05:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:31.788 --> 05:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
2016 um they they had self-reported that
 
05:09:35.150 --> 05:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
there was past in the tap water at at
 
05:09:39.070 --> 05:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
the uh in the building uh when Dees
 
05:09:41.670 --> 05:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
investigated this and they got uh
 
05:09:44.350 --> 05:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
documentation from from uh Senco Bain
 
05:09:46.910 --> 05:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
and Senco Bain sent over 990,000 pages
 
05:09:50.270 --> 05:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
of documentation the documentation did
 
05:09:55.708 --> 05:09:55.718 align:start position:0%
not list that they used 100% pooa
 
05:09:59.788 --> 05:09:59.798 align:start position:0%
chemicals um prior to 2004 they just
 
05:10:01.910 --> 05:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
they just uh Dees says they never got
 
05:10:01.920 --> 05:10:03.708 align:start position:0%
they just uh Dees says they never got
the

05:10:03.708 --> 05:10:03.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
information so they lied about that um
 
05:10:07.600 --> 05:10:09.270 align:start position:0%
information so they lied about that um
they

05:10:09.270 --> 05:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:10:14.548 --> 05:10:14.558 align:start position:0%
uh in in a in 200 in a 2016 letter to
 
05:10:16.750 --> 05:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
State Regulators s Goan wrote that it
 
05:10:20.430 --> 05:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
never used peoa as raw material at any
 
05:10:23.708 --> 05:10:23.718 align:start position:0%
point in time in marac and in 2014 they
 
05:10:25.750 --> 05:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
told the EPA that it is not and has
 
05:10:29.470 --> 05:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
never been a user of pooa per anywhere
 
05:10:31.830 --> 05:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
in the United States but the documents
 
05:10:34.948 --> 05:10:34.958 align:start position:0%
that were released at the lawsuit um it
 
05:10:36.590 --> 05:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
was a lawsuit in the state of New
 
05:10:39.548 --> 05:10:39.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire showed that s Cay knew it used
 
05:10:42.868 --> 05:10:42.878 align:start position:0%
pooa many years
 
05:10:45.948 --> 05:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
before a former State gobain Attorney
 
05:10:47.830 --> 05:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
who is now a whistleblower testified
 
05:10:50.310 --> 05:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
that sales records from 3M which sold
 
05:10:53.030 --> 05:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
pooa to Senco Bain show that the company
 
05:10:55.670 --> 05:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
brought hundreds if not thousands of
 
05:10:59.548 --> 05:10:59.558 align:start position:0%
pounds of pure pooa the 3M sales records
 
05:11:02.190 --> 05:11:02.200 align:start position:0%
are under seal in the class action suit
 
05:11:04.390 --> 05:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
and a Salesman for Dupont which also
 
05:11:06.910 --> 05:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
sold past products to St gobain last
 
05:11:09.110 --> 05:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
year testified that he had learned they
 
05:11:12.350 --> 05:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
were using pure pooa and adding it to
 
05:11:16.670 --> 05:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:20.270 --> 05:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
products uh s Cain no longer denies that
 
05:11:24.628 --> 05:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
it was using pure foa a pure peoa they
 
05:11:27.590 --> 05:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
they were caught lying and they they now
 
05:11:30.470 --> 05:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
admit that they used
 
05:11:35.750 --> 05:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:38.948 --> 05:11:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh in in a an a company executive stated
 
05:11:42.868 --> 05:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
in 2006 that stco Bain quote ought to
 
05:11:45.310 --> 05:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
downplay the potential health risks of
 
05:11:48.628 --> 05:11:48.638 align:start position:0%
pooa relative to other PS chemicals and
 
05:11:50.628 --> 05:11:50.638 align:start position:0%
argued that there are no proven health
 
05:11:54.910 --> 05:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
risks but a 1995 Company menu memo
 
05:11:57.070 --> 05:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
showed that management had issued a
 
05:12:01.190 --> 05:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
decree to stop using poo because quote
 
05:12:04.948 --> 05:12:04.958 align:start position:0%
of its to toxicity and long
 
05:12:08.190 --> 05:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
halflife the company also in 2006
 
05:12:10.750 --> 05:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
conducted blood tests for pooa on its
 
05:12:13.110 --> 05:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
employees but the results remain under
 
05:12:15.830 --> 05:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
seal and the plant's previous owner in
 
05:12:18.948 --> 05:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
1980 investigated why its male employees
 
05:12:22.830 --> 05:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
were experiencing impetus impotence and
 
05:12:27.910 --> 05:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
polymer fever so these guys have been
 
05:12:31.310 --> 05:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh being dishonest uh with the town of
 
05:12:34.628 --> 05:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:38.070 --> 05:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
years uh let me see
 
05:12:44.230 --> 05:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
um okay so so why do we need a a house
 
05:12:47.430 --> 05:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
resolution like this it's because uh
 
05:12:50.948 --> 05:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
recently irch uh which is a division of
 
05:12:54.990 --> 05:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh the World Health Organization H uh wh
 
05:12:59.230 --> 05:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
has concluded that pooa is carcinogenic
 
05:13:06.030 --> 05:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
it is a it a and uh P fos is is likely
 
05:13:08.910 --> 05:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
carcinogenic I've talked to Dees I've
 
05:13:11.110 --> 05:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
talked to our town manager I've talked
 
05:13:14.430 --> 05:13:14.440 align:start position:0%
to other people um Dees believes that
 
05:13:16.708 --> 05:13:16.718 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh Senco Bain is going to
 
05:13:18.470 --> 05:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
declare bankruptcy this is what these
 
05:13:20.830 --> 05:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
chemical companies do and move to
 
05:13:23.270 --> 05:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
another location I've also heard that
 
05:13:26.628 --> 05:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
they might Lo move to Ireland I've heard
 
05:13:28.670 --> 05:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
that they may close this facility and
 
05:13:31.390 --> 05:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
move somewhere else in New Hampshire
 
05:13:33.190 --> 05:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
we're not not getting the information
 
05:13:35.670 --> 05:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
from this closure and again this is not
 
05:13:37.910 --> 05:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
about a McDonald's closing down in our
 
05:13:41.670 --> 05:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
town this is about a a a corporation
 
05:13:44.590 --> 05:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
that has been spewing carcinogenic
 
05:13:48.190 --> 05:13:48.200 align:start position:0%
chemicals in our town for years and that
 
05:13:50.150 --> 05:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
this is not the first time this is their
 
05:13:52.830 --> 05:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
method of operating they did this in
 
05:13:55.070 --> 05:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
Vermont Vermont kicked them out they did
 
05:13:57.430 --> 05:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
this in hak Falls they are responsible
 
05:13:59.750 --> 05:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
for billions of pay of dollars for
 
05:14:02.708 --> 05:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
Remediation in those two places
 
05:14:04.948 --> 05:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
um another reason we need this is that
 
05:14:06.830 --> 05:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
there are no stakeholders at these
 
05:14:09.628 --> 05:14:09.638 align:start position:0%
discussions between Dees and St goang
 
05:14:11.868 --> 05:14:11.878 align:start position:0%
closing we don't have any elected
 
05:14:13.868 --> 05:14:13.878 align:start position:0%
officials we don't have any Town
 
05:14:16.948 --> 05:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
officials um we have not been invited to
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
the table we have no Advocates that have
 
05:14:21.868 --> 05:14:21.878 align:start position:0%
been working on this problem for years
 
05:14:26.750 --> 05:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
and lastly there's timing um what what
 
05:14:29.628 --> 05:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
are we going to do if this company which
 
05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
is headquartered in Paris us they're not
 
05:14:34.510 --> 05:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
even an American company this is a
 
05:14:36.708 --> 05:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
French company what are we going to do
 
05:14:39.350 --> 05:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
if they leave the United States we have
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
all this remediation we discover things
 
05:14:46.150 --> 05:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
down the line uh that more Health uh
 
05:14:48.230 --> 05:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
effects how are we going to go after
 
05:14:53.430 --> 05:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
them so this uh house
 
05:14:56.788 --> 05:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
resolution it outlines the the history
 
05:15:00.990 --> 05:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
of Senco Bain what what it has done how
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
it has been Bad actors for our town how
 
05:15:09.948 --> 05:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:14.190 --> 05:15:14.200 align:start position:0%
resolution is to go to President
 
05:15:17.070 --> 05:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
Biden um and President Biden because of
 
05:15:19.948 --> 05:15:19.958 align:start position:0%
his moonshot cancer program um because
 
05:15:22.110 --> 05:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
this is a cancer cluster in Southern New
 
05:15:25.150 --> 05:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it will go to uh Senator
 
05:15:28.030 --> 05:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
Shaheen Senator Hassen representative
 
05:15:31.070 --> 05:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
kuster representative papis and I'm
 
05:15:32.788 --> 05:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
asking for her a copy of this resolution
 
05:15:35.788 --> 05:15:35.798 align:start position:0%
to go to the president of France this
 
05:15:39.070 --> 05:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
company comes to the United States
 
05:15:43.670 --> 05:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
destroys our environment creates cancer
 
05:15:46.350 --> 05:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
quite frankly and they do it in the
 
05:15:49.030 --> 05:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
United States because France has very
 
05:15:50.830 --> 05:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
very strong Environmental Protection
 
05:15:53.510 --> 05:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
laws and they would not be allowed to do
 
05:15:55.230 --> 05:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
this in France so they come to the
 
05:15:57.990 --> 05:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
United States to do
 
05:15:58.000 --> 05:16:00.510 align:start position:0%
United States to do
this

05:16:00.510 --> 05:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:16:00.520 --> 05:16:02.548 align:start position:0%
this
um

05:16:02.548 --> 05:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:04.230 --> 05:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
just quickly I'm going to drill down
 
05:16:06.430 --> 05:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
into real life what this actually means
 
05:16:07.868 --> 05:16:07.878 align:start position:0%
because we're talking a little bit in
 
05:16:10.310 --> 05:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals it's very difficult to
 
05:16:12.110 --> 05:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
understand what these chemicals are what
 
05:16:15.150 --> 05:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
the effects are um we have a private
 
05:16:18.830 --> 05:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
well my well um was tested in
 
05:16:23.150 --> 05:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
2016 the levels were so high for past
 
05:16:25.510 --> 05:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
chemicals just a constellation of them
 
05:16:28.230 --> 05:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
we had to shut down our well in 2016
 
05:16:30.230 --> 05:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
we've not been able to use our well
 
05:16:32.430 --> 05:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
since then we have a whole house
 
05:16:35.070 --> 05:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
filtration system um that cost about
 
05:16:39.510 --> 05:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
$5,000 to install uh it costs about $500
 
05:16:42.310 --> 05:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
a year to replace the
 
05:16:42.320 --> 05:16:43.990 align:start position:0%
a year to replace the
filters

05:16:43.990 --> 05:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
filters
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
um there are I live in an in a on a
 
05:16:48.788 --> 05:16:48.798 align:start position:0%
street that AB buts an older
 
05:16:51.110 --> 05:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
neighborhood so we have four houses on
 
05:16:53.548 --> 05:16:53.558 align:start position:0%
my street that have private Wells four
 
05:16:56.070 --> 05:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
the other houses are in public water in
 
05:16:58.270 --> 05:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
house number one the dad has died of
 
05:17:01.708 --> 05:17:01.718 align:start position:0%
kidney cancer in house number two the
 
05:17:04.350 --> 05:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
dad and the adult son have died of colon
 
05:17:08.110 --> 05:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
cancer in house number three the dad is
 
05:17:10.230 --> 05:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
dying right now with stage four prostate
 
05:17:12.190 --> 05:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
cancer these are all cancers that are
 
05:17:14.830 --> 05:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
linked to pest exposure house number
 
05:17:17.350 --> 05:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
four that's my house I was diagnosed
 
05:17:20.430 --> 05:17:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:23.628 --> 05:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
2022 it's interesting breast cancer
 
05:17:25.868 --> 05:17:25.878 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of it around once you're
 
05:17:28.470 --> 05:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with breast cancer they start
 
05:17:30.750 --> 05:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
investigating any family history of
 
05:17:33.510 --> 05:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
breast cancer nope I got four sisters my
 
05:17:36.070 --> 05:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
mom no breast cancer they did the
 
05:17:37.868 --> 05:17:37.878 align:start position:0%
genetic workup on me to see if there's
 
05:17:41.670 --> 05:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
any mutations no mutations no genes that
 
05:17:45.150 --> 05:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
are adding to uh that would compel my
 
05:17:48.110 --> 05:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
body to have breast cancer uh I was
 
05:17:49.788 --> 05:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
talking with the environmental working
 
05:17:51.750 --> 05:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
group which was an advocacy group in
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
Washington DC and they suggested I get
 
05:17:57.470 --> 05:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
my blood tested for past chemicals now
 
05:17:59.390 --> 05:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
remember I'm one of these water Warriors
 
05:18:02.230 --> 05:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
I've been working on this since 200 16
 
05:18:04.910 --> 05:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
we put in a filtration system we went
 
05:18:06.948 --> 05:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
you know I protected my kids as much as
 
05:18:09.628 --> 05:18:09.638 align:start position:0%
I could we thought we were protecting
 
05:18:13.150 --> 05:18:13.160 align:start position:0%
our family my blood results showed that
 
05:18:16.868 --> 05:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
I have 12 past chemicals in my body that
 
05:18:18.990 --> 05:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
are over the toxic limit that's allowed
 
05:18:20.948 --> 05:18:20.958 align:start position:0%
for humans
 
05:18:24.990 --> 05:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
12 I have my constellation of
 
05:18:30.070 --> 05:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
p uh I have um my pooa chemicals I have
 
05:18:33.070 --> 05:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
38 times what normal people and the
 
05:18:35.708 --> 05:18:35.718 align:start position:0%
national average have in my in my blood
 
05:18:37.990 --> 05:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
my posos I have more than
 
05:18:43.030 --> 05:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
99% based now the P fos chemicals or the
 
05:18:45.270 --> 05:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
pooa chemicals are related to breast
 
05:18:48.190 --> 05:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
cancer and the physicians at darmouth
 
05:18:50.150 --> 05:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock believe that there's such a
 
05:18:52.510 --> 05:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
tie that they have said that my breast
 
05:18:54.830 --> 05:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
cancer is environmentally triggered by
 
05:18:54.840 --> 05:18:56.150 align:start position:0%
cancer is environmentally triggered by
environmental

05:18:56.150 --> 05:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
05:18:59.590 --> 05:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
toxins um because the posos chemicals
 
05:19:02.590 --> 05:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
were so high in my blood those attack
 
05:19:05.070 --> 05:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
your ovaries and your fallopian tubes so
 
05:19:07.350 --> 05:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
I had to go and have my ovaries and my
 
05:19:10.990 --> 05:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
Fallopian tubes removed prophylactically
 
05:19:13.510 --> 05:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
to try to keep ahead of the cancer
 
05:19:15.910 --> 05:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
that's what it means to live in a town
 
05:19:17.470 --> 05:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
that is contaminated with these
 
05:19:20.270 --> 05:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
chemicals we have to amputate parts of
 
05:19:23.110 --> 05:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
our bodies to stay ahead of the
 
05:19:26.230 --> 05:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
cancers this is the price that we
 
05:19:30.590 --> 05:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
pay my husband when he was 55 years old
 
05:19:30.600 --> 05:19:32.110 align:start position:0%
pay my husband when he was 55 years old
55

05:19:32.110 --> 05:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
55
 
05:19:34.150 --> 05:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
um he had several heart attacks and he
 
05:19:36.270 --> 05:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
ended up having a quadruple
 
05:19:40.310 --> 05:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
bypass cardiac issues are linked to past
 
05:19:43.030 --> 05:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
exposure um he's had two kidney
 
05:19:46.310 --> 05:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
operations kidney issues are linked to P
 
05:19:49.510 --> 05:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
exposure he has high cholesterol it has
 
05:19:51.910 --> 05:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with what he eats this is
 
05:19:56.350 --> 05:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
something that comes from from P um my
 
05:19:59.390 --> 05:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
my six children we have autoimmune
 
05:20:01.670 --> 05:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
disease young guys they're they're
 
05:20:03.990 --> 05:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
they're adults in their late uh mid 20s
 
05:20:07.708 --> 05:20:07.718 align:start position:0%
to early 30s cardiac issues reproductive
 
05:20:10.868 --> 05:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
issues cholesterol immune
 
05:20:13.390 --> 05:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
dysfunction and I've just last summer
 
05:20:16.750 --> 05:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
put down my fourth dog to
 
05:20:21.230 --> 05:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
cancer we live in a hot spot we have no
 
05:20:25.390 --> 05:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
idea what we're going to do the costs
 
05:20:27.390 --> 05:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
for healthc care there was an article
 
05:20:31.708 --> 05:20:31.718 align:start position:0%
today that came out in Yahoo news 250 50
 
05:20:34.190 --> 05:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
billion dollar is being spent in the
 
05:20:36.628 --> 05:20:36.638 align:start position:0%
United States because of pasas related
 
05:20:39.708 --> 05:20:39.718 align:start position:0%
health issues 250
 
05:20:39.718 --> 05:20:41.310 align:start position:0%
health issues 250
billion

05:20:41.310 --> 05:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
billion
 
05:20:44.830 --> 05:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
now I mean we're just a microcosm we're
 
05:20:47.628 --> 05:20:47.638 align:start position:0%
a we're one little family in one little
 
05:20:51.430 --> 05:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
neighborhood in our town I can tell you
 
05:20:53.750 --> 05:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
that even with insurance when you have a
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
disease like cancer you spend a lot of
 
05:21:00.590 --> 05:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
money it is very expensive to to try to
 
05:21:03.628 --> 05:21:03.638 align:start position:0%
stay healthy when these corporations are
 
05:21:06.990 --> 05:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
dumping these chemicals into our into
 
05:21:07.000 --> 05:21:08.670 align:start position:0%
dumping these chemicals into our into
our

05:21:08.670 --> 05:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:21:11.510 --> 05:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
environment um one thing I wanted to
 
05:21:14.030 --> 05:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
just point out there was a mistake on
 
05:21:17.868 --> 05:21:17.878 align:start position:0%
page let me see where is it on page page
 
05:21:19.868 --> 05:21:19.878 align:start position:0%
two line
 
05:21:24.310 --> 05:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
13 it says that it um the stacks failed
 
05:21:27.750 --> 05:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
and they did fail um and when they did
 
05:21:31.510 --> 05:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
fail uh s Cobain had installed a a
 
05:21:34.510 --> 05:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
secret bypass stack that Dees didn't
 
05:21:37.310 --> 05:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
know about so when the stacks failed
 
05:21:42.390 --> 05:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
they they subverted the the uh the fumes
 
05:21:43.750 --> 05:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
into this
 
05:21:47.948 --> 05:21:47.958 align:start position:0%
nonfiltered stack um which was which was
 
05:21:50.390 --> 05:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
not allowed that's another lie that they
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
did they said that they um that they
 
05:21:56.310 --> 05:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
that we knew about it but we didn't
 
05:21:59.070 --> 05:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
anyway um when when the stacks were put
 
05:22:02.628 --> 05:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
when they failed 17b of pest chemicals
 
05:22:04.150 --> 05:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
went through these filters they're
 
05:22:07.548 --> 05:22:07.558 align:start position:0%
called RTO filters and Senco Bain is
 
05:22:10.750 --> 05:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
very proud that only two pounds of the P
 
05:22:13.350 --> 05:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
chemicals were directly released into
 
05:22:19.548 --> 05:22:19.558 align:start position:0%
our town one liquid drop of past in 20
 
05:22:22.830 --> 05:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
Olympic pools is enough to make that
 
05:22:26.910 --> 05:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
water carcinogenic and they are proud
 
05:22:31.150 --> 05:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
that they only put forward 2 lbs of this
 
05:22:35.430 --> 05:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
stuff into our town every night they
 
05:22:37.868 --> 05:22:37.878 align:start position:0%
they burn the refu because you we don't
 
05:22:40.470 --> 05:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
know how to get rid of peas um but
 
05:22:43.190 --> 05:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
remember those those uh bonds are so
 
05:22:45.750 --> 05:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
strong that many of them don't break and
 
05:22:48.548 --> 05:22:48.558 align:start position:0%
so whenever they they burn the refu the
 
05:22:51.310 --> 05:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
soot particulate comes down on our town
 
05:22:53.708 --> 05:22:53.718 align:start position:0%
it covers our it covers our Lawns it
 
05:22:57.030 --> 05:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
covers our cars it covers everything the
 
05:22:59.628 --> 05:22:59.638 align:start position:0%
rain drives this down into the ground
 
05:23:02.990 --> 05:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
and the produce uptakes it we have
 
05:23:06.150 --> 05:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
P excuse me we have p in our apples we
 
05:23:10.990 --> 05:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
have p in our tomatoes in fact Dees has
 
05:23:14.030 --> 05:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
has advised the condo association that
 
05:23:16.470 --> 05:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
is directly across the street from Sinco
 
05:23:20.510 --> 05:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
Bain to not do any
 
05:23:23.190 --> 05:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
gardening this is what it's like to live
 
05:23:27.030 --> 05:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
in a town like this and so this house
 
05:23:31.310 --> 05:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
resolution is it documents what ST Bain
 
05:23:34.788 --> 05:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
has done to our town and I am simply
 
05:23:34.798 --> 05:23:37.110 align:start position:0%
has done to our town and I am simply
asking

05:23:37.110 --> 05:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
asking
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
for people to people in authority to
 
05:23:44.510 --> 05:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
come to the table to look out and
 
05:23:47.510 --> 05:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
protect the residents of my town and
 
05:23:49.670 --> 05:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's not even my town it's it's Bedford
 
05:23:53.430 --> 05:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
Lichfield Amherst Hollis NASA all of
 
05:23:55.868 --> 05:23:55.878 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire I just want to
 
05:23:57.670 --> 05:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're getting the
 
05:24:00.868 --> 05:24:00.878 align:start position:0%
information we need if uh president
 
05:24:02.830 --> 05:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
Biden can do something with with his
 
05:24:05.670 --> 05:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
cancer program that would be great if
 
05:24:07.708 --> 05:24:07.718 align:start position:0%
the Senators and the representatives can
 
05:24:09.910 --> 05:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
find any kind of funding that we we
 
05:24:12.270 --> 05:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
could use for cleanup if they could pull
 
05:24:15.910 --> 05:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the EPA we need help in our town and
 
05:24:17.948 --> 05:24:17.958 align:start position:0%
we're not getting it right now and so
 
05:24:19.868 --> 05:24:19.878 align:start position:0%
that's what this house resolution is
 
05:24:22.750 --> 05:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
asking thank you and I'll take
 
05:24:25.590 --> 05:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative so
 
05:24:28.230 --> 05:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the last page and this
 
05:24:30.470 --> 05:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
kind of goes to what you just touched on
 
05:24:32.750 --> 05:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
about these things that need to be done
 
05:24:35.548 --> 05:24:35.558 align:start position:0%
um for example the the P contaminated
 
05:24:37.230 --> 05:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
products materials from the closing of
 
05:24:39.310 --> 05:24:39.320 align:start position:0%
the St gobain site shall be dispos of
 
05:24:42.510 --> 05:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
properly that's one of the res after all
 
05:24:45.270 --> 05:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
the warehouses that's one of the
 
05:24:45.280 --> 05:24:46.948 align:start position:0%
the warehouses that's one of the
resolves

05:24:46.948 --> 05:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
resolves
 
05:24:50.110 --> 05:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
so do you want to say it just says that
 
05:24:51.990 --> 05:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
they should be disposed of properly you
 
05:24:54.750 --> 05:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
don't say by whom or when or
 
05:24:57.470 --> 05:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
how um is
 
05:24:57.480 --> 05:24:59.670 align:start position:0%
how um is
that

05:24:59.670 --> 05:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:25:02.230 --> 05:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
General it's a little bit generally
 
05:25:05.830 --> 05:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
vague do you is you just want to leave
 
05:25:07.708 --> 05:25:07.718 align:start position:0%
if this resolution goes forward then the
 
05:25:11.750 --> 05:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
details will be worked out uh later
 
05:25:17.030 --> 05:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
by by whomever yeah well see it's all
 
05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's all relatively new I mean we're
 
05:25:21.548 --> 05:25:21.558 align:start position:0%
finding new information every day we
 
05:25:23.750 --> 05:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
don't know how to dispose of this stuff
 
05:25:25.590 --> 05:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
we don't know whether to put it in you
 
05:25:28.470 --> 05:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
know it all goes into a lined landfill
 
05:25:31.470 --> 05:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
um even that's dangerous um so I think
 
05:25:33.948 --> 05:25:33.958 align:start position:0%
that that's one of the things um I could
 
05:25:36.270 --> 05:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
try to make it more specific but I think
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
that um it should be General because
 
05:25:41.110 --> 05:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's one of the discussion points that
 
05:25:43.270 --> 05:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
that that needs to be
 
05:25:47.070 --> 05:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
addressed right so in trying to have a
 
05:25:50.590 --> 05:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
resolution that will be more effective
 
05:25:52.230 --> 05:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
or has some teeth for
 
05:25:52.240 --> 05:25:54.548 align:start position:0%
or has some teeth for
example

05:25:54.548 --> 05:25:54.558 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:25:57.110 --> 05:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
um that the
 
05:25:59.708 --> 05:25:59.718 align:start position:0%
uh closing of the St gobain site should
 
05:26:01.150 --> 05:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
be disposed of
 
05:26:04.590 --> 05:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
properly if to me if it's said uh by
 
05:26:09.708 --> 05:26:09.718 align:start position:0%
whom you know who like uh by the by a
 
05:26:13.270 --> 05:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
certain um entity whether it's St gobain
 
05:26:16.270 --> 05:26:16.280 align:start position:0%
uh a federal program I don't know I'm
 
05:26:20.708 --> 05:26:20.718 align:start position:0%
just trying to look at this and I for
 
05:26:23.310 --> 05:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
example if it said that something will
 
05:26:25.868 --> 05:26:25.878 align:start position:0%
happen by a certain date by a certain
 
05:26:28.030 --> 05:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
entity then that's clear in people's
 
05:26:30.070 --> 05:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
minds okay this is what the resolution
 
05:26:32.548 --> 05:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
ca for this has to happen by this person
 
05:26:37.948 --> 05:26:37.958 align:start position:0%
by this time uh and and you explained it
 
05:26:40.910 --> 05:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
you know by being a little bit General
 
05:26:43.708 --> 05:26:43.718 align:start position:0%
that in some ways that's easier so uh
 
05:26:46.590 --> 05:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sure if this moves forward it will
 
05:26:49.750 --> 05:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
definitely raise awareness uh raised our
 
05:26:52.750 --> 05:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
awareness just now um so anyway my my
 
05:26:55.310 --> 05:26:55.320 align:start position:0%
question is we and we have time we can
 
05:26:58.110 --> 05:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
you can we can uh work on some of the
 
05:26:59.868 --> 05:26:59.878 align:start position:0%
wording but that's that's my question do
 
05:27:01.868 --> 05:27:01.878 align:start position:0%
you want it to be vague or or would it
 
05:27:04.150 --> 05:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
be helpful if it was more specific um if
 
05:27:05.750 --> 05:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of time I can
 
05:27:08.390 --> 05:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
certainly do some research but I'm not a
 
05:27:11.628 --> 05:27:11.638 align:start position:0%
scientist um I I mean I have a medical
 
05:27:15.310 --> 05:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
biology degree but um I I can I can put
 
05:27:18.390 --> 05:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
some examples um and not dictate a a
 
05:27:20.190 --> 05:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
course of action but I could certainly
 
05:27:22.708 --> 05:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
find some examples of ways to dispose of
 
05:27:25.390 --> 05:27:25.400 align:start position:0%
it I mean that's a that's a valid point
 
05:27:28.150 --> 05:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure it's up to me to decide
 
05:27:29.350 --> 05:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure I have the
 
05:27:33.270 --> 05:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge on how how to dispose of
 
05:27:36.788 --> 05:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
pest right or if you said uh who should
 
05:27:39.910 --> 05:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
do it again I'm just this this is first
 
05:27:41.590 --> 05:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
time we we've really drilled down to
 
05:27:43.910 --> 05:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
look at the the the
 
05:27:48.390 --> 05:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
wording um if it said s go ban should be
 
05:27:51.030 --> 05:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
responsible then that makes it clear
 
05:27:53.350 --> 05:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
again this is a resolution it's not a
 
05:27:53.360 --> 05:27:55.110 align:start position:0%
again this is a resolution it's not a
statute

05:27:55.110 --> 05:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:27:57.670 --> 05:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh so we're going to start executing
 
05:27:59.590 --> 05:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
some of these next week but I think this
 
05:28:03.350 --> 05:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
is one that we we have we have time um
 
05:28:07.708 --> 05:28:07.718 align:start position:0%
if if you want to uh it's up to you and
 
05:28:10.510 --> 05:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
and and in the other co-sponsors or in
 
05:28:12.430 --> 05:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
some of us on the committee if you
 
05:28:12.440 --> 05:28:13.390 align:start position:0%
some of us on the committee if you
wanted

05:28:13.390 --> 05:28:13.400 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
05:28:18.030 --> 05:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
to uh think about perhaps some different
 
05:28:19.788 --> 05:28:19.798 align:start position:0%
wording or more effective specific
 
05:28:22.430 --> 05:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
wording towards the end uh those are
 
05:28:23.990 --> 05:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
just some of my thoughts not really a
 
05:28:25.948 --> 05:28:25.958 align:start position:0%
questioning other than would you want to
 
05:28:28.590 --> 05:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
think about uh if if we if you had time
 
05:28:31.030 --> 05:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
to work on the language
 
05:28:34.030 --> 05:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
um to your point I would be happy to say
 
05:28:36.830 --> 05:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
that s Cain is responsible for disposing
 
05:28:40.670 --> 05:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
of everything and that includes um in um
 
05:28:43.430 --> 05:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh equipment that's inside the facility
 
05:28:46.548 --> 05:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
that is also dirty that that might be
 
05:28:48.948 --> 05:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
helpful because in reading this uh you
 
05:28:52.270 --> 05:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
know is the is the town of marac is the
 
05:28:53.910 --> 05:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
county of Hillsboro is the state of New
 
05:28:55.910 --> 05:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is it St gobain is it some
 
05:29:00.510 --> 05:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
other entity that uh is needs to take
 
05:29:02.708 --> 05:29:02.718 align:start position:0%
action here I that I don't know it's
 
05:29:05.110 --> 05:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get a handle on I I
 
05:29:06.470 --> 05:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
think though that the point you're
 
05:29:09.150 --> 05:29:09.160 align:start position:0%
getting at and one of my one of my
 
05:29:11.948 --> 05:29:11.958 align:start position:0%
advocacy points is that the residents of
 
05:29:14.430 --> 05:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire should not be paying one
 
05:29:18.110 --> 05:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:21.750 --> 05:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
cleanup and that perhaps might be if if
 
05:29:24.230 --> 05:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
we continue to work on the wording that
 
05:29:26.750 --> 05:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
I think that would be helpful in moving
 
05:29:28.990 --> 05:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
this resolution forward if if that what
 
05:29:30.910 --> 05:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
you just said about
 
05:29:33.150 --> 05:29:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh the residents from New Hampshire
 
05:29:36.990 --> 05:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
should should not be uh held responsible
 
05:29:40.390 --> 05:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
for Mal Fe that they did not commit
 
05:29:42.270 --> 05:29:42.280 align:start position:0%
right be very happy to work on an
 
05:29:45.430 --> 05:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
amendment um just for clarification for
 
05:29:47.788 --> 05:29:47.798 align:start position:0%
this is my first house resolution is it
 
05:29:50.350 --> 05:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
the committee that will do the amendment
 
05:29:52.670 --> 05:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
or because it's a house resolution is
 
05:29:53.590 --> 05:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
that my
 
05:29:56.470 --> 05:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility well the the committee
 
05:29:58.948 --> 05:29:58.958 align:start position:0%
owns these measures after they submitted
 
05:30:01.910 --> 05:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
um but uh if if you want to uh pick
 
05:30:06.150 --> 05:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
someone uh any of us uh if you want to
 
05:30:08.270 --> 05:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
uh improve improve the language or
 
05:30:11.350 --> 05:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
change the language um as chair I I
 
05:30:14.390 --> 05:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
would say I we we can give give you time
 
05:30:16.350 --> 05:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
for that you know this is only January
 
05:30:19.910 --> 05:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
12 yeah so um I'm sure you're going to
 
05:30:23.110 --> 05:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
get some more questions and input uh but
 
05:30:25.708 --> 05:30:25.718 align:start position:0%
uh that was my question and thought was
 
05:30:28.270 --> 05:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
uh the the wording and being more
 
05:30:30.030 --> 05:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
specific and and I like what you just
 
05:30:34.190 --> 05:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
said said about uh you know not holding
 
05:30:36.590 --> 05:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh obviously it it appears that the
 
05:30:38.830 --> 05:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
corporation is is
 
05:30:42.948 --> 05:30:42.958 align:start position:0%
responsible and uh so okay so there's
 
05:30:44.750 --> 05:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
that so that I'll leave that to you and
 
05:30:47.750 --> 05:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
you can Circle back yes uh represent
 
05:30:50.750 --> 05:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
massila sure thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:30:52.548 --> 05:30:52.558 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking me
 
05:30:55.788 --> 05:30:55.798 align:start position:0%
question so am I correct in saying that
 
05:30:59.030 --> 05:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
you did this as a resolution as opposed
 
05:31:01.910 --> 05:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
to a bill to get the attention of the
 
05:31:04.628 --> 05:31:04.638 align:start position:0%
feds as opposed to getting direct action
 
05:31:07.910 --> 05:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
from the state that's correct that is
 
05:31:10.708 --> 05:31:10.718 align:start position:0%
correct I want I want Federal oversight
 
05:31:13.708 --> 05:31:13.718 align:start position:0%
on this um and again because we're not
 
05:31:16.030 --> 05:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
closing down a McDonald's we're closing
 
05:31:19.270 --> 05:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
down a multi-billion doll company
 
05:31:22.708 --> 05:31:22.718 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollars in fact they they
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
had um the European Anti-Trust
 
05:31:29.470 --> 05:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
commission finded s Cain 1.3 million oh
 
05:31:33.390 --> 05:31:33.400 align:start position:0%
1.3 billion pounds so these are Big
 
05:31:37.548 --> 05:31:37.558 align:start position:0%
players um and they also have a whole
 
05:31:39.868 --> 05:31:39.878 align:start position:0%
slate of lawyers they have more lawyers
 
05:31:42.230 --> 05:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
than God you know and so every time we
 
05:31:45.390 --> 05:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
try to do anything we get pushed back
 
05:31:46.948 --> 05:31:46.958 align:start position:0%
from the lawyers because they've got the
 
05:31:49.750 --> 05:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
money they've got the the
 
05:31:52.990 --> 05:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
resources you're welcome to follow up on
 
05:31:55.948 --> 05:31:55.958 align:start position:0%
that uh again this is new as well but
 
05:32:00.070 --> 05:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
the you just mentioned that you in resp
 
05:32:02.030 --> 05:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
respon to repes representative Miller
 
05:32:04.590 --> 05:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
that she wanted the feds to be aware of
 
05:32:08.430 --> 05:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
this uh it doesn't really say that here
 
05:32:10.350 --> 05:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
uh you you you want copies to go to the
 
05:32:11.830 --> 05:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
president United States and the
 
05:32:15.030 --> 05:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
Congressional Delegation uh again
 
05:32:17.830 --> 05:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps if you specifically mention the
 
05:32:21.190 --> 05:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
EPA uh that might make it a stronger
 
05:32:23.670 --> 05:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
resolution um just to follow up on on
 
05:32:25.670 --> 05:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
the previous question other questions I
 
05:32:28.270 --> 05:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
saw hands representative
 
05:32:30.910 --> 05:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
pman U thank you Mr
 
05:32:32.670 --> 05:32:32.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative to Tak my
 
05:32:35.070 --> 05:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
question what products do they make to
 
05:32:36.788 --> 05:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
use these
 
05:32:41.270 --> 05:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
chemicals facility um so uh prior to S
 
05:32:44.270 --> 05:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
Cain it was a company called chemfab and
 
05:32:46.350 --> 05:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
what they do is they make chemically
 
05:32:49.350 --> 05:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
coated fabrics and this is through their
 
05:32:51.190 --> 05:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
plastic divisions so
 
05:32:53.670 --> 05:32:53.680 align:start position:0%
these we call them Plastics but they're
 
05:32:55.830 --> 05:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
really like Teflon chemicals you know
 
05:32:57.430 --> 05:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
the the stuff that's on your pans that
 
05:33:00.110 --> 05:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
are non-stick and so they coat these
 
05:33:04.230 --> 05:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
Fabrics with this Teflon Teflon plastic
 
05:33:06.868 --> 05:33:06.878 align:start position:0%
and then those Fabrics are used for
 
05:33:08.708 --> 05:33:08.718 align:start position:0%
radar shields you know those big domes
 
05:33:12.110 --> 05:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
that are on Radars um some stadiums have
 
05:33:16.470 --> 05:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
those foldable um roofs that that that's
 
05:33:19.070 --> 05:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's uh chemfab they're also used in
 
05:33:21.230 --> 05:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
biohazard suits because they're
 
05:33:23.350 --> 05:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
impermeable that's the whole thing with
 
05:33:26.590 --> 05:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
these chemicals um they don't breathe um
 
05:33:28.430 --> 05:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
and they're used in astronaut suits as
 
05:33:31.150 --> 05:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
well so there is is a need for these
 
05:33:32.990 --> 05:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
chemicals and there's a need for these
 
05:33:35.910 --> 05:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
products however I mean I I mentioned
 
05:33:38.110 --> 05:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
earlier I used to work as a clinical bi
 
05:33:40.910 --> 05:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
biologist I've worked with biohazardous
 
05:33:43.470 --> 05:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
material and there there's a way to
 
05:33:45.510 --> 05:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
handle this you don't just throw it into
 
05:33:47.628 --> 05:33:47.638 align:start position:0%
our Rivers you don't just you know burn
 
05:33:49.830 --> 05:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
it and let it go out into the air there
 
05:33:52.430 --> 05:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
are ways to contain these these
 
05:33:56.230 --> 05:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
chemicals a followup Mr uh followup and
 
05:33:58.868 --> 05:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
then representative levit
 
05:34:01.270 --> 05:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
afterwards how
 
05:34:01.280 --> 05:34:07.270 align:start position:0%
afterwards how
the

05:34:07.270 --> 05:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:09.548 --> 05:34:09.558 align:start position:0%
ground some of it is being poured
 
05:34:11.548 --> 05:34:11.558 align:start position:0%
directly but the majority of it remember
 
05:34:13.628 --> 05:34:13.638 align:start position:0%
I said earlier they burn and when they
 
05:34:16.590 --> 05:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
burn at night all of this soot which is
 
05:34:19.948 --> 05:34:19.958 align:start position:0%
is unbroken pfast chemicals falls down
 
05:34:22.628 --> 05:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
onto our town and the surrounding towns
 
05:34:24.910 --> 05:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
which is why we're starting to see
 
05:34:28.150 --> 05:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
contamination um and the rain drives it
 
05:34:30.590 --> 05:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
down but the thing is I mean we're
 
05:34:32.628 --> 05:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
advising people that if you have a an
 
05:34:34.548 --> 05:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
outside dog if you have your dog out in
 
05:34:37.110 --> 05:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
your yard you should wipe their paws off
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
before bringing them into the house you
 
05:34:41.670 --> 05:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
should vacuum your carpets on a regular
 
05:34:44.990 --> 05:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
basis I mean people should anyway but um
 
05:34:47.670 --> 05:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
because you're tracking in pest all the
 
05:34:51.110 --> 05:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
time you know we filter our water but
 
05:34:53.150 --> 05:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
the water at Dunkin Donuts is not
 
05:34:55.430 --> 05:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
filtered the water at the restaurant
 
05:34:57.590 --> 05:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
that that cooks our pasta is not
 
05:35:01.590 --> 05:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
filtered you know it's a huge
 
05:35:01.600 --> 05:35:04.510 align:start position:0%
filtered you know it's a huge
problem

05:35:04.510 --> 05:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:35:08.430 --> 05:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
cyber odds I mean I guess pretty huge
 
05:35:12.110 --> 05:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
but um is there are they looking at
 
05:35:15.310 --> 05:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
people from across the state that have
 
05:35:17.548 --> 05:35:17.558 align:start position:0%
large amounts of pest in their systems
 
05:35:19.110 --> 05:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
just like you like say you stop at the
 
05:35:21.350 --> 05:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
Dunkin Donuts you know in marac on your
 
05:35:24.590 --> 05:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
way to work but you live up north you
 
05:35:26.788 --> 05:35:26.798 align:start position:0%
know farther up north
 
05:35:29.548 --> 05:35:29.558 align:start position:0%
um the thing is you cannot assume that
 
05:35:30.910 --> 05:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
you're you're not contaminated with
 
05:35:33.150 --> 05:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
pasas until you test just like you
 
05:35:35.510 --> 05:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
cannot assume your water is clean unless
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
you test P you can't see it you can't
 
05:35:41.390 --> 05:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
smell it you can't taste it in your
 
05:35:46.350 --> 05:35:46.360 align:start position:0%
water so um in my first term in 2018
 
05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
2020 we passed a bill that um mandated
 
05:35:53.030 --> 05:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
that insurance paid for past blood
 
05:35:55.470 --> 05:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
testing so that's and that's available
 
05:35:58.390 --> 05:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
to anyone in the in um in New Hampshire
 
05:36:01.390 --> 05:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so you can and I can get
 
05:36:03.470 --> 05:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
you the the code of the the test that
 
05:36:05.510 --> 05:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be ordered because that that's
 
05:36:06.990 --> 05:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
another thing too is a lot of the
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
Physicians um don't have experience and
 
05:36:11.190 --> 05:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
don't have knowledge about how to treat
 
05:36:14.110 --> 05:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
pest that's in fact I'll just tell you a
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
quick story my um the surgeon that did
 
05:36:18.390 --> 05:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
my um
 
05:36:21.030 --> 05:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
mastectomy um I after I had my blood
 
05:36:23.150 --> 05:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
work done I came with the results
 
05:36:25.548 --> 05:36:25.558 align:start position:0%
showing that I had these 12 chemicals
 
05:36:27.910 --> 05:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
that were over the toxic limit and I
 
05:36:29.670 --> 05:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
tried to give her the results of the
 
05:36:31.230 --> 05:36:31.240 align:start position:0%
chemical and without even looking at
 
05:36:32.910 --> 05:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
them she pushed them back and she said
 
05:36:34.628 --> 05:36:34.638 align:start position:0%
I'm just a surgeon I don't I don't need
 
05:36:37.868 --> 05:36:37.878 align:start position:0%
to know about p and I said well you're
 
05:36:40.548 --> 05:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
no longer my surgeon
 
05:36:43.830 --> 05:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
then representative Le thank you chair M
 
05:36:46.270 --> 05:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
let be sure I admire you admire your
 
05:36:48.628 --> 05:36:48.638 align:start position:0%
strength and courage in this I really do
 
05:36:50.390 --> 05:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
um and and I sincerely mean that I mean
 
05:36:52.390 --> 05:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
I could never fathom me having to worry
 
05:36:56.948 --> 05:36:56.958 align:start position:0%
about wiping my dogs paws off or um you
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
know the drinking water 32 times I mean
 
05:37:03.548 --> 05:37:03.558 align:start position:0%
this is something that needs
 
05:37:07.230 --> 05:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
to be brought to attention as soon as
 
05:37:10.628 --> 05:37:10.638 align:start position:0%
possible I mean this isn't you know this
 
05:37:12.990 --> 05:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
is you're doing I'm going to make this
 
05:37:15.470 --> 05:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
brief is you got the ball rolling on
 
05:37:17.750 --> 05:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
this and this is something that I you
 
05:37:19.270 --> 05:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
know as far as I'm concerned lastly is
 
05:37:21.708 --> 05:37:21.718 align:start position:0%
that I'd be suing the hell out of them
 
05:37:26.510 --> 05:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry apologize I'm I but the town
 
05:37:29.030 --> 05:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
needs to get take an effective approach
 
05:37:32.830 --> 05:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
on this and um I hope this goes forward
 
05:37:35.390 --> 05:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
in a positive way because um the word's
 
05:37:38.670 --> 05:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
out now yep and and that's the point of
 
05:37:41.150 --> 05:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
this is to to raise awareness because a
 
05:37:42.350 --> 05:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
lot of people have been hearing about
 
05:37:44.190 --> 05:37:44.200 align:start position:0%
pest they've never seen the whole
 
05:37:47.628 --> 05:37:47.638 align:start position:0%
picture it is devastating to our town
 
05:37:50.788 --> 05:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
this situation is
 
05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
devastating any other questions for the
 
05:37:56.030 --> 05:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this
 
05:37:58.628 --> 05:37:58.638 align:start position:0%
resolution okay again I would just say
 
05:38:00.110 --> 05:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh if you want if you want to work on
 
05:38:02.230 --> 05:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
the wording we we won't exec this for a
 
05:38:04.868 --> 05:38:04.878 align:start position:0%
while uh we'll give us some time and uh
 
05:38:07.670 --> 05:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
if you want to if you know any of us uh
 
05:38:10.350 --> 05:38:10.360 align:start position:0%
that you uh looks like you know someone
 
05:38:12.548 --> 05:38:12.558 align:start position:0%
that you can uh work with on and then
 
05:38:14.868 --> 05:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
that person that rep Committee Member
 
05:38:17.150 --> 05:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
can um bring forward the amended
 
05:38:19.510 --> 05:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
language then we could uh go from there
 
05:38:21.190 --> 05:38:21.200 align:start position:0%

in support of the bill in support of the
 
05:38:37.270 --> 05:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
resolution it's not a bill it's a house
 
05:38:39.708 --> 05:38:39.718 align:start position:0%

hr28 my name is Maria Perez I'm a state
 
05:38:50.190 --> 05:38:50.200 align:start position:0%
representative from Dix 43 in Milford
 
05:38:52.510 --> 05:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
the reason that I'm supporting and I'm
 
05:38:54.468 --> 05:38:54.478 align:start position:0%
uh co-sponsoring this resolution is
 
05:38:58.110 --> 05:38:58.120 align:start position:0%
because sovin has two buildings in
 
05:39:00.788 --> 05:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
Milford we already have super siiz and
 
05:39:03.548 --> 05:39:03.558 align:start position:0%
Mur that we for many
 
05:39:07.030 --> 05:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
years has to deal with it uh our soil
 
05:39:09.830 --> 05:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
has been contaminated with other um
 
05:39:12.868 --> 05:39:12.878 align:start position:0%
chemicals we have to buy water from
 
05:39:14.310 --> 05:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
panacha water in
 
05:39:17.230 --> 05:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
NASA um and then we already have issues
 
05:39:20.590 --> 05:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
buying water from Pena because we have
 
05:39:23.270 --> 05:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh pipes that's so old that now we have
 
05:39:25.230 --> 05:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
uh Brown drinking
 
05:39:28.270 --> 05:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
water my issue with single vein being in
 
05:39:30.510 --> 05:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
Milford is that I've been asking when
 
05:39:33.708 --> 05:39:33.718 align:start position:0%
they saw the first building that it was
 
05:39:37.390 --> 05:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
like no one knew it was like one day
 
05:39:39.670 --> 05:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
single vein was there and the next day
 
05:39:40.868 --> 05:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
the building was
 
05:39:43.750 --> 05:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
sold I've been asking for
 
05:39:45.788 --> 05:39:45.798 align:start position:0%

05:39:47.468 --> 05:39:47.478 align:start position:0%

05:41:11.628 --> 05:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
taking a sample of the soil there to see
 
05:41:12.468 --> 05:41:12.478 align:start position:0%
what's in
 
05:41:15.510 --> 05:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
it I've been asking the T Miler the
 
05:41:17.868 --> 05:41:17.878 align:start position:0%
water department many times and some
 
05:41:21.830 --> 05:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
residents sent me emails um as told them
 
05:41:23.390 --> 05:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
me that they've been asking the water
 
05:41:26.030 --> 05:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
department for reports and they haven't
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
heard anything back I've been waiting
 
05:41:30.110 --> 05:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
for an email or call back back and I
 
05:41:31.670 --> 05:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
haven't get it call back on email from
 
05:41:33.750 --> 05:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
the water department as
 
05:41:38.070 --> 05:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
well any other questions for the
 
05:41:39.868 --> 05:41:39.878 align:start position:0%
representative seean thank you
 
05:41:42.230 --> 05:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative Perez uh the final card
 
05:41:44.948 --> 05:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
on hr28 is Katherine corkery from
 
05:41:48.868 --> 05:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
conquered in the New Hampshire Sierra
 
05:41:51.670 --> 05:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
Club oh
 
05:41:56.708 --> 05:41:56.718 align:start position:0%
yes a rip some SEL uh it it said 21 but
 
05:42:00.150 --> 05:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
you it you meant 28 and is is uh I have
 
05:42:02.510 --> 05:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
kathern corker's name is Katherine
 
05:42:06.390 --> 05:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:12.548 --> 05:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:15.708 --> 05:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
representative sorry long day um for you
 
05:42:17.390 --> 05:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
two um I'm representative Laurence
 
05:42:19.230 --> 05:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
seelig I represent Durham New Hampshire
 
05:42:22.070 --> 05:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
which is straford county 10 um last year
 
05:42:23.910 --> 05:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
or two years ago I learned about pasas
 
05:42:27.150 --> 05:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
at peas um which is in Portsmouth um
 
05:42:28.590 --> 05:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
which was detected when a number of
 
05:42:30.350 --> 05:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
children in one of their daycare centers
 
05:42:32.150 --> 05:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
became unexpectedly ill and they had a
 
05:42:34.990 --> 05:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
very high child pediatric cancer cluster
 
05:42:37.868 --> 05:42:37.878 align:start position:0%
they discovered that the uh firefighting
 
05:42:39.548 --> 05:42:39.558 align:start position:0%
foam that had been used at the Air Force
 
05:42:42.868 --> 05:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
Base was full of these chemicals um and
 
05:42:44.670 --> 05:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
all of these children were getting sick
 
05:42:46.350 --> 05:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
so they then tested and discovered that
 
05:42:49.350 --> 05:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
every well um within a specific radius
 
05:42:52.948 --> 05:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
of P's was deeply infect infested with
 
05:42:56.150 --> 05:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
the p and p foas and p other things
 
05:42:57.468 --> 05:42:57.478 align:start position:0%
there's a reason I wasn't a science
 
05:43:00.948 --> 05:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
major um and so um my understanding is
 
05:43:02.750 --> 05:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
that the Air Force Base is having to do
 
05:43:03.830 --> 05:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
most of the cleanup but they've
 
05:43:05.150 --> 05:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
obviously had to do all kinds of things
 
05:43:07.548 --> 05:43:07.558 align:start position:0%
to bring water into that area I also
 
05:43:09.868 --> 05:43:09.878 align:start position:0%
know the town of Durham um a few years
 
05:43:12.670 --> 05:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
ago was tasked with extending the town's
 
05:43:14.430 --> 05:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
public water supply out to the Lee
 
05:43:16.910 --> 05:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
Traffic Circle because that was another
 
05:43:19.030 --> 05:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
area that was discovered to be um deeply
 
05:43:20.670 --> 05:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
infested with very dangerous water it
 
05:43:21.788 --> 05:43:21.798 align:start position:0%
was discovered someone was trying to
 
05:43:24.230 --> 05:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
sell a property and when the water was
 
05:43:26.070 --> 05:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
tested it came back so high for
 
05:43:28.030 --> 05:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
chemicals that um the businesses in that
 
05:43:30.350 --> 05:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
area which included Dunkin Donuts
 
05:43:31.868 --> 05:43:31.878 align:start position:0%
Wendy's McDonald's and four other
 
05:43:35.270 --> 05:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
restaurants all had to temporarily pause
 
05:43:37.150 --> 05:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
to get water brought in to make it safe
 
05:43:39.830 --> 05:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
so um I just I very strongly support
 
05:43:42.350 --> 05:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
this resolution and I know that there's
 
05:43:44.430 --> 05:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
been some work at peas already about how
 
05:43:45.990 --> 05:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
to address some of issues and trying to
 
05:43:48.270 --> 05:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
05:43:51.230 --> 05:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
Solutions thank you
 
05:43:51.240 --> 05:43:53.430 align:start position:0%
Solutions thank you
representative

05:43:53.430 --> 05:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:43:56.230 --> 05:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
and if no one has a pressing question
 
05:43:58.390 --> 05:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
Katherine corkery from the Sierra Club
 
05:44:03.990 --> 05:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:06.708 --> 05:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
hello thank you so much for taking my
 
05:44:11.190 --> 05:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
testimony and um allowing me to share um
 
05:44:13.590 --> 05:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
just some more information uh New
 
05:44:15.990 --> 05:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Sierra Club supports the
 
05:44:17.750 --> 05:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
spirit of this
 
05:44:20.150 --> 05:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
resolution um
 
05:44:26.150 --> 05:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
and appreciate the um the ENC that the
 
05:44:28.390 --> 05:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
bill encourages or the resolution
 
05:44:31.750 --> 05:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
encourages is uh the communication
 
05:44:35.510 --> 05:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
between all of these entities
 
05:44:39.468 --> 05:44:39.478 align:start position:0%
um I want to I have some handouts uh I
 
05:44:41.990 --> 05:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
know this is a committee that doesn't
 
05:44:46.150 --> 05:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
normally talk about water quality or uh
 
05:44:48.948 --> 05:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
pollution and so I have some handouts
 
05:44:51.310 --> 05:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
about uh this
 
05:44:55.708 --> 05:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
contaminant um pasas and pooa the same
 
05:45:00.910 --> 05:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
one um these chemicals are um inorganic
 
05:45:04.548 --> 05:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
and they're uh human-made
 
05:45:08.270 --> 05:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
manufactured and um they
 
05:45:12.548 --> 05:45:12.558 align:start position:0%
are called Forever chemicals for reason
 
05:45:17.230 --> 05:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
um I I I I will be brief but I did want
 
05:45:22.230 --> 05:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
to um highlight um for your
 
05:45:27.868 --> 05:45:27.878 align:start position:0%
um uh research um uh a few movies uh
 
05:45:30.830 --> 05:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
that highlight uh these issues one is
 
05:45:34.270 --> 05:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
dark Waters and it is about the first
 
05:45:37.670 --> 05:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
class action lawsuit uh that was filed
 
05:45:41.390 --> 05:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
against Dupont for these chemicals uh
 
05:45:44.230 --> 05:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
dark Waters is the name of it and then
 
05:45:46.910 --> 05:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's another one uh called the devil
 
05:45:50.750 --> 05:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
we know and that documents uh these
 
05:45:56.150 --> 05:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
chemicals and and it's you know uh it is
 
05:46:01.070 --> 05:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
very um heavy uh there's some very
 
05:46:04.350 --> 05:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
serious conditions that that you'll
 
05:46:08.750 --> 05:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
learn about uh just as we have with
 
05:46:13.868 --> 05:46:13.878 align:start position:0%
representative um Wendy Thomas um and
 
05:46:16.990 --> 05:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
the this is a serious pollutant um this
 
05:46:19.708 --> 05:46:19.718 align:start position:0%
is a chemical that has been brought to
 
05:46:24.070 --> 05:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
our communities uh through various uh
 
05:46:30.628 --> 05:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and uses um and I it it's
 
05:46:33.708 --> 05:46:33.718 align:start position:0%
it's really devastating uh I I'll just
 
05:46:36.430 --> 05:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
repeat that um so we do support the
 
05:46:38.868 --> 05:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
spirit of the bill I have some handouts
 
05:46:43.390 --> 05:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
and um I am certainly not as expertised
 
05:46:47.430 --> 05:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
as our uh honor or as the representative
 
05:46:49.628 --> 05:46:49.638 align:start position:0%
but uh I would be happy to take any
 
05:46:53.150 --> 05:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
questions um oh wait I had a suggestion
 
05:46:59.070 --> 05:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh about um language for the uh page
 
05:47:04.590 --> 05:47:04.600 align:start position:0%
three um I think um in considering how
 
05:47:07.670 --> 05:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
to dispose of these chemicals oversite
 
05:47:13.750 --> 05:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
from the AG um is pretty important um as
 
05:47:16.350 --> 05:47:16.360 align:start position:0%
well as the Department of Justice
 
05:47:20.110 --> 05:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
because there are a number of uh class
 
05:47:23.948 --> 05:47:23.958 align:start position:0%
action and legal matters involved with
 
05:47:27.190 --> 05:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
this as well so you heard my ear earlier
 
05:47:28.910 --> 05:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
comments to the prime sponsor about the
 
05:47:31.150 --> 05:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
language that what prompted okay good
 
05:47:34.430 --> 05:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so you can presumably work with
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely Aaron Brockovich is that a
 
05:47:39.230 --> 05:47:39.240 align:start position:0%
name that's you've ever heard of sure
 
05:47:43.628 --> 05:47:43.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:43.638 --> 05:47:45.628 align:start position:0%
 
here

05:47:45.628 --> 05:47:45.638 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:47:48.708 --> 05:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
uh any question for Katherine uh
 
05:47:48.718 --> 05:47:50.150 align:start position:0%
uh any question for Katherine uh
representative

05:47:50.150 --> 05:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:47:52.990 --> 05:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
carry uh Katherine is this something
 
05:47:55.590 --> 05:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
that uh maybe the federal brownfields
 
05:47:57.788 --> 05:47:57.798 align:start position:0%
program might be engaged to do be
 
05:47:59.510 --> 05:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
involved in the clean
 
05:48:03.990 --> 05:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's definitely um there is a
 
05:48:07.948 --> 05:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
division uh it's like the
 
05:48:07.958 --> 05:48:09.708 align:start position:0%
division uh it's like the
chemicals

05:48:09.708 --> 05:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
chemicals
 
05:48:12.948 --> 05:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
soils and some development I think it's
 
05:48:18.230 --> 05:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
called in the EPA that uh CL deals with
 
05:48:21.628 --> 05:48:21.638 align:start position:0%
um brownfields and also the superf fund
 
05:48:25.750 --> 05:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
sites and um I I think it's called rra
 
05:48:27.868 --> 05:48:27.878 align:start position:0%
they you know they have all sorts of
 
05:48:27.878 --> 05:48:29.230 align:start position:0%
they you know they have all sorts of
abbreviations

05:48:29.230 --> 05:48:29.240 align:start position:0%
abbreviations
 
05:48:32.310 --> 05:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
the whole alphabet um but uh that
 
05:48:34.788 --> 05:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
division is is likely the one that you
 
05:48:39.270 --> 05:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
want to talk to represent L thank you
 
05:48:41.750 --> 05:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
chair M so this is going to take a
 
05:48:44.430 --> 05:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
village you know as legislators you know
 
05:48:45.788 --> 05:48:45.798 align:start position:0%
we can bring this to the Forefront in
 
05:48:47.110 --> 05:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
our committee even bring it to the house
 
05:48:50.510 --> 05:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
floor and we know if we have bipartisan
 
05:48:52.430 --> 05:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
support probably will we're going to get
 
05:48:56.230 --> 05:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
this done but my Stern advice is we need
 
05:48:58.310 --> 05:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
to get the towns involved we need to get
 
05:48:59.910 --> 05:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
the State involved other than the
 
05:49:01.910 --> 05:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislative part we have you know two
 
05:49:04.270 --> 05:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
other branches here that the executive
 
05:49:08.030 --> 05:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
and judicial so I mean I understand and
 
05:49:10.190 --> 05:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
again I admire your strength and courage
 
05:49:12.070 --> 05:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
and in coming up here but this has come
 
05:49:14.190 --> 05:49:14.200 align:start position:0%
to a point where you you know where
 
05:49:16.868 --> 05:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
people are definitely dying because of
 
05:49:19.468 --> 05:49:19.478 align:start position:0%
this I mean you know and we need a
 
05:49:21.590 --> 05:49:21.600 align:start position:0%

05:49:49.070 --> 05:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
of the day
 
05:49:51.590 --> 05:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
CA I heard somebody chering it's been a
 
05:49:57.190 --> 05:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
long day uh uh cacr 13 uh Constitutional
 
05:49:59.948 --> 05:49:59.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment concurrent resolu ution 13
 
05:50:02.910 --> 05:50:02.920 align:start position:0%
relating to slavery and involuntary
 
05:50:06.190 --> 05:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
servitude and the prime sponsor is here
 
05:50:09.750 --> 05:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Balden before uh
 
05:50:12.310 --> 05:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
before you start um let me just share
 
05:50:14.030 --> 05:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
quickly uh I spoke with representative
 
05:50:18.190 --> 05:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
Balden on the phone last night and uh we
 
05:50:19.830 --> 05:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
were asking about we were talking about
 
05:50:21.390 --> 05:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
the timing and they said well this is
 
05:50:23.110 --> 05:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
the last bill of the day round three and
 
05:50:25.430 --> 05:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing following this bill so
 
05:50:30.030 --> 05:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
we have plenty of time on it and uh I
 
05:50:32.150 --> 05:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
need to be careful about making those
 
05:50:35.750 --> 05:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
statements because um I didn't want to
 
05:50:38.590 --> 05:50:38.600 align:start position:0%
apply to representative Bolen that we uh
 
05:50:41.030 --> 05:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
this is an interesting measure we we can
 
05:50:42.948 --> 05:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
be here all night that's kind of what I
 
05:50:44.910 --> 05:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
conveyed because nobody's coming in
 
05:50:48.350 --> 05:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
after us problem is I've been advised uh
 
05:50:51.670 --> 05:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
for example our our uh researcher
 
05:50:54.110 --> 05:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
Christina and uh there's all kinds of
 
05:50:55.830 --> 05:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
staff that needs to stay here at the
 
05:50:57.948 --> 05:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
State House and the lob until we finish
 
05:51:00.590 --> 05:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
so lesson for me to be next next week
 
05:51:02.990 --> 05:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
our last bill will be at one instead of
 
05:51:05.750 --> 05:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
three so uh everybody who's here looking
 
05:51:07.868 --> 05:51:07.878 align:start position:0%
forward to thank you for coming in
 
05:51:09.468 --> 05:51:09.478 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to say we're going to
 
05:51:11.390 --> 05:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
hear you out but as we told the folks
 
05:51:13.788 --> 05:51:13.798 align:start position:0%
this morning if someone has already made
 
05:51:16.350 --> 05:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
a specific point that you want to make
 
05:51:18.868 --> 05:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
if if you cannot repeat that so that we
 
05:51:21.910 --> 05:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
can keep moving uh for the folks that
 
05:51:24.070 --> 05:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
are waiting on us this Friday night so
 
05:51:26.750 --> 05:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
all that said we're ready to go uh
 
05:51:28.350 --> 05:51:28.360 align:start position:0%
representative B thanks so much looking
 
05:51:30.230 --> 05:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
move forward to your
 
05:51:32.628 --> 05:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
introduction thanks um for the record
 
05:51:34.910 --> 05:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
I'm Amanda Balin a representative from
 
05:51:36.708 --> 05:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District
 
05:51:39.708 --> 05:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
25 um and for what it's worth all the
 
05:51:42.110 --> 05:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
folks who've showed up to testify and
 
05:51:43.868 --> 05:51:43.878 align:start position:0%
support of this legislation today are
 
05:51:46.468 --> 05:51:46.478 align:start position:0%
aware that three minutes or less is the
 
05:51:49.390 --> 05:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
best way to hold a person's attention
 
05:51:50.708 --> 05:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I have a little bit more
 
05:51:52.910 --> 05:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
testimony than that so I'll be breaking
 
05:51:58.350 --> 05:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
the rule but um so uh this bill uh would
 
05:52:01.788 --> 05:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
would uh the cacr would enshrine the
 
05:52:03.868 --> 05:52:03.878 align:start position:0%
abolition of slavery in the state
 
05:52:08.110 --> 05:52:08.120 align:start position:0%
constitution pretty simple um I'm I'd be
 
05:52:09.910 --> 05:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
interested to hear if there are any
 
05:52:12.270 --> 05:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
questions uh later on
 
05:52:15.190 --> 05:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
about the legislation and why it might
 
05:52:17.030 --> 05:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
not be simple to some but I think it's
 
05:52:19.070 --> 05:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily simple and I really like
 
05:52:21.910 --> 05:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
legislation like that um a little
 
05:52:27.590 --> 05:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
history of um slavery New Hampshire so
 
05:52:29.910 --> 05:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
before the Civil War um you know around
 
05:52:32.030 --> 05:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
the time of the American Revolution our
 
05:52:33.548 --> 05:52:33.558 align:start position:0%
state was in the habit
 
05:52:38.030 --> 05:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
of purchasing uh humans um and uh
 
05:52:41.830 --> 05:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
forcing them to work in the military um
 
05:52:44.788 --> 05:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
because they had trouble uh recruiting
 
05:52:47.548 --> 05:52:47.558 align:start position:0%
people um for the to fight the American
 
05:52:50.230 --> 05:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
Revolution and um in response to that
 
05:52:54.468 --> 05:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
there were some folks in 1779 about 20
 
05:52:57.390 --> 05:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
slaves who submitted a petition to this
 
05:52:59.310 --> 05:52:59.320 align:start position:0%
same body
 
05:53:01.948 --> 05:53:01.958 align:start position:0%
but we were meeting in exiter back then
 
05:53:03.430 --> 05:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
um and they were asking for their
 
05:53:06.468 --> 05:53:06.478 align:start position:0%
freedom and that petition has some
 
05:53:10.548 --> 05:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
really poetic content for example um P
 
05:53:12.670 --> 05:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
private or public tyranny and slavery
 
05:53:15.910 --> 05:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
are alike detestable to Minds conscious
 
05:53:19.310 --> 05:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
of the equal Dignity of human nature um
 
05:53:21.070 --> 05:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
and then another part I really
 
05:53:23.390 --> 05:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
appreciated said uh through ignorance
 
05:53:25.948 --> 05:53:25.958 align:start position:0%
and brutish violence of their countrymen
 
05:53:28.430 --> 05:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
and by the Sinister design of others
 
05:53:30.830 --> 05:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
children incapable of self-defense whose
 
05:53:33.468 --> 05:53:33.478 align:start position:0%
infancy might have prompted protection
 
05:53:35.590 --> 05:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
were seized imprisoned and transported
 
05:53:37.670 --> 05:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
from their native country where they are
 
05:53:39.390 --> 05:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
compelled to drag on their lives in
 
05:53:42.190 --> 05:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
miserable servitude thus often is the
 
05:53:44.430 --> 05:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
parents cheek wet for the loss of a
 
05:53:46.628 --> 05:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
child torn by the cruel hand of violence
 
05:53:49.310 --> 05:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
from her aching bosom so is this really
 
05:53:52.628 --> 05:53:52.638 align:start position:0%
poetic uh petition and we as a
 
05:53:55.390 --> 05:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
legislature ignored it and never never
 
05:53:57.310 --> 05:53:57.320 align:start position:0%
granted their freedom uh to those 20
 
05:53:59.590 --> 05:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
slaves and it was only until 2014 that
 
05:54:02.868 --> 05:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
Senator Martha Phil Clark put in uh a
 
05:54:05.430 --> 05:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
legislation to grant them their freedom
 
05:54:06.750 --> 05:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
obviously post
 
05:54:09.750 --> 05:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
humously um so a few year four years
 
05:54:13.270 --> 05:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
after that petition was put in in 1779
 
05:54:14.990 --> 05:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh the con the state constitution was
 
05:54:16.910 --> 05:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
drafted I went to the state archives for
 
05:54:19.310 --> 05:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
my birthday uh last month and I actually
 
05:54:22.590 --> 05:54:22.600 align:start position:0%
get to hold the Constitution and I
 
05:54:24.430 --> 05:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
highly recommend that activity to anyone
 
05:54:25.990 --> 05:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
Ashley Miller the state archist is
 
05:54:27.788 --> 05:54:27.798 align:start position:0%
really nice and really excited to show
 
05:54:27.798 --> 05:54:28.670 align:start position:0%
really nice and really excited to show
people

05:54:28.670 --> 05:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:54:30.430 --> 05:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
actual pieces of history that you can
 
05:54:33.948 --> 05:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
hold in your bare hands um so that
 
05:54:35.868 --> 05:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh read in part that all
 
05:54:37.510 --> 05:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
men are born equal and independent with
 
05:54:39.430 --> 05:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
natural rights among which are enjoying
 
05:54:40.708 --> 05:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
and defending life and Liberty and I'm
 
05:54:42.628 --> 05:54:42.638 align:start position:0%
sure in your first bill this morning you
 
05:54:45.190 --> 05:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of terminology like
 
05:54:48.830 --> 05:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
that um at the time in 1783 there was
 
05:54:50.190 --> 05:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
some debate as to whether or not that
 
05:54:53.150 --> 05:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
ban slavery but obviously in 1790 the
 
05:54:55.310 --> 05:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
census counted over 150 slaves in the
 
05:54:57.430 --> 05:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so the
 
05:54:59.350 --> 05:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution at that time did not ban
 
05:55:03.350 --> 05:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
slavery in 1857 the state uh this
 
05:55:05.548 --> 05:55:05.558 align:start position:0%
legislature passed a law that assessed a
 
05:55:07.590 --> 05:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
penalty for enslaving another person it
 
05:55:10.110 --> 05:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
was one to five years of hard
 
05:55:14.030 --> 05:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
labor um this law is so old that I
 
05:55:15.830 --> 05:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't even find the wording until I
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
found it in a in an article in a South
 
05:55:21.670 --> 05:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
Carolina newspaper published in 1857
 
05:55:23.430 --> 05:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
where they quoted the the law that was
 
05:55:25.430 --> 05:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
passed by the New Hampshire legislature
 
05:55:26.830 --> 05:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
and they essentially said if we can't
 
05:55:28.750 --> 05:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
bring our slaves to new hampsh Hampshire
 
05:55:30.310 --> 05:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire shouldn't visit South
 
05:55:34.190 --> 05:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
Carolina so they were not having it um
 
05:55:37.190 --> 05:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
and uh but other than that the the law
 
05:55:38.830 --> 05:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
did not explicitly abolish slavery
 
05:55:40.510 --> 05:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
didn't ban slavery it just assessed a
 
05:55:42.628 --> 05:55:42.638 align:start position:0%
small penalty of one to five years of
 
05:55:44.468 --> 05:55:44.478 align:start position:0%
hard labor the type of penalty we don't
 
05:55:45.670 --> 05:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
even Implement
 
05:55:49.150 --> 05:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
today um and uh so it didn't actually
 
05:55:50.548 --> 05:55:50.558 align:start position:0%
guarantee freedom to all New Hampshire
 
05:55:53.868 --> 05:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
citizens but a few years later Civil War
 
05:55:57.150 --> 05:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
ended 13th Amendment um abolished
 
05:55:58.670 --> 05:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
private ens slav
 
05:56:01.110 --> 05:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
um you know Nationwide and that was that
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
and very few States followed up with
 
05:56:05.070 --> 05:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
mirroring the 13th Amendment in their
 
05:56:07.270 --> 05:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
own state constitutions but in recent
 
05:56:08.548 --> 05:56:08.558 align:start position:0%
years there has been a nationwide
 
05:56:10.510 --> 05:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
movement especially in light of the
 
05:56:14.468 --> 05:56:14.478 align:start position:0%
state of national politics to embed a
 
05:56:15.990 --> 05:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
reflection of the 13th Amendment in
 
05:56:17.670 --> 05:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
individual state constitutions and I'd
 
05:56:19.150 --> 05:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
say about half the country's done it so
 
05:56:21.510 --> 05:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
far at this point and I think it's time
 
05:56:24.070 --> 05:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
for n Hamshire to join in that effort
 
05:56:25.750 --> 05:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
and in particular I think in light of
 
05:56:29.590 --> 05:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
the first bill that you heard today
 
05:56:32.708 --> 05:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
if if slavery is abolished in New
 
05:56:36.468 --> 05:56:36.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of the federal 13th
 
05:56:38.910 --> 05:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment what happens if one day
 
05:56:42.190 --> 05:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
something like this morning's first bill
 
05:56:45.430 --> 05:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
passes it's hard to say
 
05:56:49.350 --> 05:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
um and I think uh oh by the way so I
 
05:56:52.150 --> 05:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um you know those 20
 
05:56:54.190 --> 05:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
slaves were finally freed post humously
 
05:56:56.708 --> 05:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
but I think even then um you know how
 
05:56:58.708 --> 05:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
long did that take I'm not interested in
 
05:57:00.150 --> 05:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
doing the math right now but overall I
 
05:57:02.070 --> 05:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
could say that for 300 years New
 
05:57:04.430 --> 05:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's kind of avoided addressing
 
05:57:06.030 --> 05:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
the issue and it's worth noting that
 
05:57:07.350 --> 05:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
like we were the last state to
 
05:57:09.868 --> 05:57:09.878 align:start position:0%
acknowledge Martin Luther King Jr day
 
05:57:11.468 --> 05:57:11.478 align:start position:0%
and um you know there's a lot to
 
05:57:13.070 --> 05:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate about a citizen legislature
 
05:57:15.708 --> 05:57:15.718 align:start position:0%
but sometimes I think when your populace
 
05:57:18.990 --> 05:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
is just so distinctly of one type of
 
05:57:21.510 --> 05:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
person it can be hard to sympathize with
 
05:57:22.910 --> 05:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
the experiences of people in another
 
05:57:26.590 --> 05:57:26.600 align:start position:0%
part of the country and to stand by them
 
05:57:29.110 --> 05:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
um and so on a personal note I come from
 
05:57:32.390 --> 05:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
slave owning people um this was kind of
 
05:57:34.270 --> 05:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
a shock to me I I mean I kind of assumed
 
05:57:37.150 --> 05:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
but I didn't know the extent of it my
 
05:57:39.548 --> 05:57:39.558 align:start position:0%
11th great grandfather came from England
 
05:57:43.150 --> 05:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
to Virginia in the 1600s in Jamestown
 
05:57:45.468 --> 05:57:45.478 align:start position:0%
and uh his like great great great great
 
05:57:47.390 --> 05:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
grandson my fifth great-grandfather was
 
05:57:49.830 --> 05:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
a congressman us Congressman for
 
05:57:53.310 --> 05:57:53.320 align:start position:0%
Virginia and he argued passionately in
 
05:57:55.430 --> 05:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
favor of slavery it was the 1800s before
 
05:57:58.310 --> 05:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
the Civil War um I've read transcript of
 
05:58:00.468 --> 05:58:00.478 align:start position:0%
his speeches in Congress and he
 
05:58:02.190 --> 05:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
literally said it's a man's natural
 
05:58:06.070 --> 05:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
right to own another man um he was also
 
05:58:07.910 --> 05:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
super irritated with women who would get
 
05:58:09.948 --> 05:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
involved in politics at the time there
 
05:58:11.830 --> 05:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
was some women who prepared a petition
 
05:58:13.910 --> 05:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
and submitted it to Congress calling for
 
05:58:16.990 --> 05:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
the end of slavery and um in his remarks
 
05:58:18.270 --> 05:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
on the floor he said if they were
 
05:58:19.708 --> 05:58:19.718 align:start position:0%
married they'd have something better to
 
05:58:22.390 --> 05:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
do with their time um so I don't think
 
05:58:23.750 --> 05:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
he would like me but you guys wouldn't
 
05:58:24.830 --> 05:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
like him either because he was
 
05:58:26.590 --> 05:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
definitely the kind of lawmaker that
 
05:58:28.430 --> 05:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
when he started talking you'd leave for
 
05:58:30.990 --> 05:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
a bathroom break very long-winded more
 
05:58:35.150 --> 05:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
than me um he would go on and on so I'm
 
05:58:36.270 --> 05:58:36.280 align:start position:0%
confident that my fifth great
 
05:58:38.350 --> 05:58:38.360 align:start position:0%
grandfather Thomas Tyler Balin would be
 
05:58:39.670 --> 05:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
very disappointed to know that just a
 
05:58:43.548 --> 05:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
few years after he died
 
05:58:47.708 --> 05:58:47.718 align:start position:0%
um the the US ban slavery um private
 
05:58:50.230 --> 05:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
enslavement with the 13th Amendment and
 
05:58:51.590 --> 05:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
I think especially he'd be disappointed
 
05:58:52.830 --> 05:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
because between him and his brother
 
05:58:55.230 --> 05:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
James they owned over 40 slaves at the
 
05:58:59.948 --> 05:58:59.958 align:start position:0%
time um and you know at the time slavery
 
05:59:01.670 --> 05:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
was framed as a states rights issue the
 
05:59:02.910 --> 05:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
Democrats were the party of states
 
05:59:04.468 --> 05:59:04.478 align:start position:0%
rights they wanted to leave it up to
 
05:59:08.150 --> 05:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
individual states and um and as a result
 
05:59:09.430 --> 05:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
with the passage of the 13th Amendment
 
05:59:11.070 --> 05:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
it was assumed that this was applicable
 
05:59:14.070 --> 05:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
in all states um but again going back to
 
05:59:15.468 --> 05:59:15.478 align:start position:0%
if something like the first bill that
 
05:59:17.510 --> 05:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
you heard today were to actually pass at
 
05:59:19.628 --> 05:59:19.638 align:start position:0%
any point in the future where would we
 
05:59:19.638 --> 05:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
any point in the future where would we
be

05:59:20.680 --> 05:59:20.690 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:59:20.690 --> 05:59:21.910 align:start position:0%
be
[Music]

05:59:21.910 --> 05:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:59:27.190 --> 05:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
um so it is my hope today that uh we can
 
05:59:29.788 --> 05:59:29.798 align:start position:0%
reject everything my ancestors stood for
 
05:59:31.548 --> 05:59:31.558 align:start position:0%
and pass full abolition at the state
 
05:59:34.190 --> 05:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
level enshrine it in the Constitution um
 
05:59:36.070 --> 05:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
and more specifically allow our voters
 
05:59:38.030 --> 05:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
to band together to enshrine this basic
 
05:59:40.270 --> 05:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
freedom in the State Constitution and
 
05:59:41.750 --> 05:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully make Thomas Tyler Balin roll
 
05:59:42.788 --> 05:59:42.798 align:start position:0%
over in his
 
05:59:46.990 --> 05:59:47.000 align:start position:0%
grave and a note about his grave um my
 
05:59:49.750 --> 05:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
ancestor Thomas Tyler Bolton is the only
 
05:59:52.868 --> 05:59:52.878 align:start position:0%
Congressman uh the only person to die in
 
05:59:55.628 --> 05:59:55.638 align:start position:0%
the Congressional Chambers um I'm not as
 
05:59:57.190 --> 05:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
nervous right now as I might be at the
 
05:59:59.110 --> 05:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
well or in front of a senate committee
 
06:00:01.468 --> 06:00:01.478 align:start position:0%
but apparently Thomas Tyler Balin was
 
06:00:03.468 --> 06:00:03.478 align:start position:0%
standing at the well speaking when he
 
06:00:05.070 --> 06:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
literally dropped dead mids sentence
 
06:00:07.788 --> 06:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
which means his last words are recorded
 
06:00:11.468 --> 06:00:11.478 align:start position:0%
uh they're just not coherent and um he
 
06:00:13.590 --> 06:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
was I guess everyone felt so sorry for
 
06:00:16.110 --> 06:00:16.120 align:start position:0%
him that even the president at the time
 
06:00:18.670 --> 06:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
turned out for his funeral um Andrew
 
06:00:21.788 --> 06:00:21.798 align:start position:0%
Jackson so somewhere in someone's pocket
 
06:00:24.110 --> 06:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
is a likeness of a guy who attended my
 
06:00:25.750 --> 06:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
fifth great grandfather's
 
06:00:28.030 --> 06:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
funeral um
 
06:00:31.150 --> 06:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
you know and when he died there were
 
06:00:32.948 --> 06:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
many things that I experienced today
 
06:00:35.708 --> 06:00:35.718 align:start position:0%
that were inconceivable for him um the
 
06:00:38.708 --> 06:00:38.718 align:start position:0%
idea that I would be able to own
 
06:00:42.830 --> 06:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
property or get divorced or Vote or
 
06:00:45.868 --> 06:00:45.878 align:start position:0%
serve in public office um were
 
06:00:47.948 --> 06:00:47.958 align:start position:0%
inconceivable to my fifth grade
 
06:00:50.910 --> 06:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
grandfather um so I hope that you will
 
06:00:53.628 --> 06:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
join with me in deeply upsetting his
 
06:00:56.070 --> 06:00:56.080 align:start position:0%
memory um and making him roll over in
 
06:00:58.590 --> 06:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
his DC grave and in closing I just want
 
06:01:02.150 --> 06:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
to read one more portion of that 1779
 
06:01:05.110 --> 06:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
petition um this was their closing
 
06:01:07.590 --> 06:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
statement Therefore your humble slaves
 
06:01:09.350 --> 06:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
most devoutly pray for the sake of
 
06:01:12.548 --> 06:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
injured Liberty for the sake of Justice
 
06:01:14.830 --> 06:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
humanity and the rights of mankind for
 
06:01:16.948 --> 06:01:16.958 align:start position:0%
the honor of religion and by all that is
 
06:01:18.788 --> 06:01:18.798 align:start position:0%
dear that your honors would enact such
 
06:01:20.788 --> 06:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
laws and regulations as you and your
 
06:01:23.670 --> 06:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
wisdom think proper whereby we may
 
06:01:25.628 --> 06:01:25.638 align:start position:0%
regain our Liberty and be ranked in the
 
06:01:27.628 --> 06:01:27.638 align:start position:0%
class of free agents and that the name
 
06:01:31.110 --> 06:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
of slave may not more be heard in a land
 
06:01:34.030 --> 06:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
gloriously contending for the sweets of
 
06:01:35.830 --> 06:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
freedom because you know at the time it
 
06:01:38.390 --> 06:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
was 1779 so these are folks that wanted
 
06:01:40.350 --> 06:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
to be included in the Freedom Movement
 
06:01:42.788 --> 06:01:42.798 align:start position:0%
in our country and um just be really
 
06:01:45.590 --> 06:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
great if we could stand by them today in
 
06:01:48.150 --> 06:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
2024 I'll take
 
06:01:51.070 --> 06:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank you we of great history
 
06:01:54.708 --> 06:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
love the history you shared um questions
 
06:01:56.350 --> 06:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
for the prime
 
06:01:56.360 --> 06:01:58.948 align:start position:0%
for the prime
sponsor

06:01:58.948 --> 06:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
06:02:00.750 --> 06:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
06:02:03.708 --> 06:02:03.718 align:start position:0%
Massa thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
06:02:06.350 --> 06:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question my
 
06:02:09.430 --> 06:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
question is presently is slavery and
 
06:02:12.510 --> 06:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
involuntary servitude defined in the New
 
06:02:15.910 --> 06:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution at all um it's
 
06:02:17.628 --> 06:02:17.638 align:start position:0%
not referenced any there's nothing in
 
06:02:19.070 --> 06:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
our state constitution touching
 
06:02:21.430 --> 06:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
enslavement and more specifically there
 
06:02:23.788 --> 06:02:23.798 align:start position:0%
aren't I'm not aware of any definitions
 
06:02:26.110 --> 06:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
in general in the just speaking to the
 
06:02:28.548 --> 06:02:28.558 align:start position:0%
issue of definitions say I'm not aware
 
06:02:30.788 --> 06:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
of the use of definitions in the state
 
06:02:33.230 --> 06:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
constitution um do you think it would be
 
06:02:35.548 --> 06:02:35.558 align:start position:0%
necessary to Define them to make it more
 
06:02:38.030 --> 06:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
clear no no I think that you know for
 
06:02:39.750 --> 06:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
example your right to sit in that chair
 
06:02:41.310 --> 06:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
and be a lawmaker it's not in the
 
06:02:43.150 --> 06:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution a lot of that comes out of
 
06:02:46.510 --> 06:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
case law um just the fact that you and I
 
06:02:48.510 --> 06:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
as women can vote um that's not in the
 
06:02:50.670 --> 06:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
state constitution those are things that
 
06:02:52.390 --> 06:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
you know people scrape together fighting
 
06:02:55.510 --> 06:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
tooth and nail over centuries um arguing
 
06:02:59.628 --> 06:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
in in court um petitions lawsuits um to
 
06:03:01.468 --> 06:03:01.478 align:start position:0%
be able to obtain and I think there is
 
06:03:02.990 --> 06:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
to some extent some things that are now
 
06:03:05.788 --> 06:03:05.798 align:start position:0%
inferred because of certain changes to
 
06:03:07.990 --> 06:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
the wording of the Constitution but um
 
06:03:09.590 --> 06:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
there isn't anything touching slavery
 
06:03:10.708 --> 06:03:10.718 align:start position:0%

worded is perfect it's okay yeah I think
 
06:03:14.948 --> 06:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
it it really wraps it up in a pretty bow
 
06:03:16.628 --> 06:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
it's short sweet and it's something that
 
06:03:19.788 --> 06:03:19.798 align:start position:0%

you do we agree that slavery needs to be
 
06:05:17.030 --> 06:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
abolished slavery was supposed to have
 
06:05:18.590 --> 06:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
ended with at the end of the Civil War
 
06:05:20.990 --> 06:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
and the creation of the 13th Amendment a
 
06:05:22.548 --> 06:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
promise that this great nation will no
 
06:05:24.270 --> 06:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
longer put someone in Chains and hold
 
06:05:26.708 --> 06:05:26.718 align:start position:0%
them in captivity the promise came with
 
06:05:28.590 --> 06:05:28.600 align:start position:0%
an ex ception but not just at the
 
06:05:30.868 --> 06:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
federal level many of our New Hampshire
 
06:05:32.708 --> 06:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
citizens are not aware that slavery and
 
06:05:35.030 --> 06:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
inv voluntary servitude still exists in
 
06:05:38.150 --> 06:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
our state but ironically it's true the
 
06:05:39.868 --> 06:05:39.878 align:start position:0%
13th Amendment clearly states neither
 
06:05:42.310 --> 06:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
slavery nor involuntary servitude except
 
06:05:43.868 --> 06:05:43.878 align:start position:0%
for the punishment of crime shall be
 
06:05:45.548 --> 06:05:45.558 align:start position:0%
tolerated in this
 
06:05:48.070 --> 06:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
state it's this particular loophole that
 
06:05:49.788 --> 06:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire just like many states have
 
06:05:51.868 --> 06:05:51.878 align:start position:0%
never drafted the bill to
 
06:05:54.230 --> 06:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
abolish nobody should be subjected to
 
06:05:56.030 --> 06:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
slavery because of being convicted of a
 
06:05:58.590 --> 06:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
crime as as individuals with VAR life
 
06:06:00.070 --> 06:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
experiences we don't agree on many
 
06:06:01.628 --> 06:06:01.638 align:start position:0%
things but what I believe in my heart is
 
06:06:04.468 --> 06:06:04.478 align:start position:0%
that my fellow New Hampshire don't want
 
06:06:07.070 --> 06:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
to continue to be a slave state maybe
 
06:06:08.390 --> 06:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
you're thinking it's just words and a
 
06:06:10.150 --> 06:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
really old document and not actually a
 
06:06:12.708 --> 06:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
practice we uphold on an everyday basis
 
06:06:14.190 --> 06:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
I mean we're in the north we fought on
 
06:06:16.190 --> 06:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
the union Civ on the union side of the
 
06:06:18.788 --> 06:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
Civil War we have a diverse populations
 
06:06:21.230 --> 06:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
we don't have slaves it is astonishing
 
06:06:23.430 --> 06:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
that in the 21st century we still find
 
06:06:24.868 --> 06:06:24.878 align:start position:0%
ourselves discussing the need to
 
06:06:27.110 --> 06:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
eradicate this V institution from from
 
06:06:29.310 --> 06:06:29.320 align:start position:0%
our midst but the truth is that the
 
06:06:30.750 --> 06:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
fight against slavery is a battle that
 
06:06:33.110 --> 06:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
we must continue to wage until every
 
06:06:35.190 --> 06:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
last trace of this Injustice is
 
06:06:37.468 --> 06:06:37.478 align:start position:0%
eradicated from our great state there
 
06:06:40.390 --> 06:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
are 2,442 people currently incarcerated
 
06:06:42.590 --> 06:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire being served spoiled
 
06:06:45.190 --> 06:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
food sometimes filled with maggots
 
06:06:47.830 --> 06:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
individuals behind walls are paying 378
 
06:06:51.628 --> 06:06:51.638 align:start position:0%
for a 3o stick of deodorant 525 for
 
06:06:53.868 --> 06:06:53.878 align:start position:0%
toothpaste while working and being paid
 
06:06:57.548 --> 06:06:57.558 align:start position:0%
1 to 150 an hour a financial incen to
 
06:07:00.270 --> 06:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
incarcerate for-profit prison propers
 
06:07:03.190 --> 06:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
like GTO phone providers key Fe by
 
06:07:05.030 --> 06:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
Parker company earn Millions off of
 
06:07:07.788 --> 06:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
exploiting prison of forced labor I know
 
06:07:09.350 --> 06:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
this because I was enslaved in the state
 
06:07:11.548 --> 06:07:11.558 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire a mission in life is to
 
06:07:13.868 --> 06:07:13.878 align:start position:0%
help restore human rights to all human
 
06:07:15.510 --> 06:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
beings because of the atrocities I
 
06:07:18.230 --> 06:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
witnessed firsthand and suffered while
 
06:07:20.510 --> 06:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
incarcerated incarceration is marketed
 
06:07:22.990 --> 06:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
as a mechanism to rehabilitate someone
 
06:07:25.390 --> 06:07:25.400 align:start position:0%
so that they can be a productive citizen
 
06:07:26.868 --> 06:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
many times prison staff will retire
 
06:07:28.708 --> 06:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
retaliate against inmates for filing
 
06:07:30.750 --> 06:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
complaints if you see something you're
 
06:07:32.788 --> 06:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
supposed to say something except in
 
06:07:34.910 --> 06:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
prison standing up for yourself for
 
06:07:36.910 --> 06:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
others can mean forced labor or the risk
 
06:07:39.030 --> 06:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
of losing a few hours of fresh air you
 
06:07:41.548 --> 06:07:41.558 align:start position:0%
may be allowed solitary confinement in a
 
06:07:45.190 --> 06:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
5x8 cell for months or years how is this
 
06:07:47.190 --> 06:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation instead of the culture of
 
06:07:49.868 --> 06:07:49.878 align:start position:0%
prison only creates or exacerbates many
 
06:07:52.150 --> 06:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
of the reasons people end up here so
 
06:07:54.750 --> 06:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
many human beings go into the system go
 
06:07:57.430 --> 06:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
into the system suffering from some form
 
06:07:59.628 --> 06:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
of mental illness it could be from drug
 
06:08:01.510 --> 06:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
abuse childhood trauma physical
 
06:08:03.910 --> 06:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
emotional sexual abuse or effects of
 
06:08:06.190 --> 06:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
abject poverty or a combination of all
 
06:08:08.310 --> 06:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
the above as surveyed you will find a
 
06:08:09.868 --> 06:08:09.878 align:start position:0%
majority of incarcerated people have
 
06:08:12.310 --> 06:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
been severely abused or witness horrific
 
06:08:14.430 --> 06:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
violence from a young age once they're
 
06:08:15.628 --> 06:08:15.638 align:start position:0%
released from prison it could be
 
06:08:17.310 --> 06:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult to acclimate
 
06:08:19.430 --> 06:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
themselves into the outside world it can
 
06:08:20.830 --> 06:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
be compared to being dropped off in
 
06:08:22.270 --> 06:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
another country where you don't know the
 
06:08:24.750 --> 06:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
language the land or the Customs but
 
06:08:26.390 --> 06:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
you're expected to figure it out with
 
06:08:28.708 --> 06:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
little no help for many is too
 
06:08:30.350 --> 06:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
frightening and they end up back in hell
 
06:08:32.430 --> 06:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
where they they wanted to escape it's
 
06:08:34.510 --> 06:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
called recidivism but it's also being
 
06:08:37.270 --> 06:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
coined as post- incarcerated syndrome
 
06:08:38.708 --> 06:08:38.718 align:start position:0%
The Narrative is that someone is merely
 
06:08:40.468 --> 06:08:40.478 align:start position:0%
a repeat or offend or a career Criminal
 
06:08:42.070 --> 06:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
by what they may actually be is
 
06:08:44.910 --> 06:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
impoverished abused child turned
 
06:08:47.030 --> 06:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
offender turned abused by the state
 
06:08:49.750 --> 06:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
enslaved adult everyone needs to be held
 
06:08:51.750 --> 06:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
accountable for their wrongdoings this
 
06:08:53.868 --> 06:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
also includes the state that we the
 
06:08:55.990 --> 06:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
people are attempting to do not just
 
06:08:58.070 --> 06:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
here but in any other states with the
 
06:09:00.310 --> 06:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
across but in eight other states across
 
06:09:02.628 --> 06:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
the country is advocate for empathy and
 
06:09:04.430 --> 06:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
a radical change on how we re
 
06:09:06.390 --> 06:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
rehabilitate and help our fellow human
 
06:09:08.590 --> 06:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
beings become productive citizens who
 
06:09:09.910 --> 06:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
can be held accountable for their
 
06:09:12.150 --> 06:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
actions without being exploited abused
 
06:09:14.830 --> 06:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
or killed this cycle will not end until
 
06:09:16.670 --> 06:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to gain financially from
 
06:09:19.230 --> 06:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
a person's life being destroyed we the
 
06:09:21.270 --> 06:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
people will not rest until any and all
 
06:09:23.788 --> 06:09:23.798 align:start position:0%
Financial incentives to incarcerate a
 
06:09:25.750 --> 06:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
discontinued and erased from American
 
06:09:28.030 --> 06:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
economics we will begin our work with
 
06:09:30.190 --> 06:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
that the president created we will begin
 
06:09:31.948 --> 06:09:31.958 align:start position:0%
our work with the president that created
 
06:09:34.070 --> 06:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
this monster in the first place the
 
06:09:36.430 --> 06:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
Constitutional exception Clause of
 
06:09:38.468 --> 06:09:38.478 align:start position:0%
criminality so let us not forget the
 
06:09:40.030 --> 06:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
Legacy that we leave for our future
 
06:09:42.190 --> 06:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
Generations one that either perpetuates
 
06:09:44.190 --> 06:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
the hearts of the past or paves a way
 
06:09:46.270 --> 06:09:46.280 align:start position:0%
for brighter more inclusive future
 
06:09:48.190 --> 06:09:48.200 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as a tough or soft
 
06:09:51.110 --> 06:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
D crime politician we are either pro
 
06:09:52.910 --> 06:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
slavery and choose not to accept the
 
06:09:54.628 --> 06:09:54.638 align:start position:0%
bill abolishing slavery and voluntary
 
06:09:57.510 --> 06:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
servitude in its entirety leaving the
 
06:09:59.350 --> 06:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the practices has been
 
06:10:01.390 --> 06:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
tolerating in place but we are
 
06:10:03.868 --> 06:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
anti-slavery and we fix our community by
 
06:10:05.708 --> 06:10:05.718 align:start position:0%
accepting the bill to abolish
 
06:10:08.390 --> 06:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
recognizing humanity and each of us I
 
06:10:09.830 --> 06:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that you accept the
 
06:10:12.510 --> 06:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
bill to go on record and abolish slavery
 
06:10:14.948 --> 06:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
in its entirety we can't reform a prison
 
06:10:17.670 --> 06:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
systems who whose roots are slavery and
 
06:10:20.390 --> 06:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
involuntary servitude thank you and I
 
06:10:22.468 --> 06:10:22.478 align:start position:0%
want to make a correction that on the
 
06:10:25.390 --> 06:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
first page I said a dollar to a150 an
 
06:10:32.150 --> 06:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:34.628 --> 06:10:34.638 align:start position:0%
day I don't know if anybody has any
 
06:10:34.638 --> 06:10:38.548 align:start position:0%
day I don't know if anybody has any
questions

06:10:38.548 --> 06:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:40.990 --> 06:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
but okay thank you for that are
 
06:10:44.030 --> 06:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
questions for for Dennis or
 
06:10:47.548 --> 06:10:47.558 align:start position:0%
ailia I have just one thought and I am
 
06:10:51.430 --> 06:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
trying to anticipate down the road um to
 
06:10:53.510 --> 06:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
Executive session or when this measure
 
06:10:54.788 --> 06:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
comes to the house
 
06:10:57.110 --> 06:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
floor um
 
06:11:00.070 --> 06:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
that I'm guessing I'm anticipating there
 
06:11:03.510 --> 06:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
may or may not be some folks who when
 
06:11:05.788 --> 06:11:05.798 align:start position:0%
they think of involuntary servitude in
 
06:11:08.788 --> 06:11:08.798 align:start position:0%
in in incarceration or in a Prison
 
06:11:08.798 --> 06:11:09.990 align:start position:0%
in in incarceration or in a Prison
Correctional

06:11:09.990 --> 06:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
Correctional
 
06:11:13.190 --> 06:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
setting um having been in this business
 
06:11:14.990 --> 06:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
while you try to anticipate questions
 
06:11:17.270 --> 06:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
that would come up so I I'm thinking
 
06:11:19.670 --> 06:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
someone may ask if this measure moves
 
06:11:22.948 --> 06:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
forward is that going to restrict people
 
06:11:26.830 --> 06:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
from um or or require correction
 
06:11:29.948 --> 06:11:29.958 align:start position:0%
facilities to change their policies or
 
06:11:34.190 --> 06:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
whatever um I I don't know but uh maybe
 
06:11:36.070 --> 06:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh the prime spart still here maybe
 
06:11:37.990 --> 06:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
before we go to exec session in a week
 
06:11:42.270 --> 06:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
or a couple weeks or whatever um that is
 
06:11:45.030 --> 06:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
that issue of of correctional facilities
 
06:11:47.868 --> 06:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
and inv voluntary servitude and and how
 
06:11:50.468 --> 06:11:50.478 align:start position:0%
there's nobody here in opposition to the
 
06:11:55.390 --> 06:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm just wondering if we we you
 
06:11:57.990 --> 06:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
will we get some blowback from
 
06:11:59.830 --> 06:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
Correctional people saying if this
 
06:12:02.510 --> 06:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
passes then we can't uh do what we need
 
06:12:05.070 --> 06:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
to do so that's that's I'm just throwing
 
06:12:07.868 --> 06:12:07.878 align:start position:0%
that out there for uh for your
 
06:12:10.230 --> 06:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
consideration so qu uh or could you
 
06:12:13.230 --> 06:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
speak to that Dennis I would say why
 
06:12:16.030 --> 06:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
would we need that in order to enforce
 
06:12:19.788 --> 06:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
the construct of Labor why is slavery
 
06:12:22.670 --> 06:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
necessary in order for corrections to do
 
06:12:25.310 --> 06:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
business right it's also to an
 
06:12:26.990 --> 06:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
understanding it is also human rights
 
06:12:28.948 --> 06:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
violation right section four of the
 
06:12:30.548 --> 06:12:30.558 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Human Rights says slavery
 
06:12:32.990 --> 06:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
is abolishing all of its forms the
 
06:12:34.830 --> 06:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
exception clause in the US Constitution
 
06:12:36.590 --> 06:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
and from many of the states that hold it
 
06:12:40.548 --> 06:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
by the exception is a form of slavery so
 
06:12:43.070 --> 06:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
we are in contrast to international law
 
06:12:45.510 --> 06:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
right and this is a Humanity issue right
 
06:12:47.510 --> 06:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
if we have to keep arguing that slavery
 
06:12:50.430 --> 06:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
is necessary we are still stuck in the
 
06:12:52.670 --> 06:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
1800s right when we look at the
 
06:12:54.990 --> 06:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
Abolitionist fight back in the day and
 
06:12:56.468 --> 06:12:56.478 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say the abolitionist
 
06:12:58.750 --> 06:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
movement is more American than anything
 
06:13:00.990 --> 06:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
in this in our history right this is why
 
06:13:04.110 --> 06:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
we sit where we're at today right they
 
06:13:06.430 --> 06:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
talked about the gradual process New
 
06:13:07.830 --> 06:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was very involved with that
 
06:13:10.390 --> 06:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
process Vermont was as well main right
 
06:13:11.868 --> 06:13:11.878 align:start position:0%
the Northeast was very involved with the
 
06:13:13.990 --> 06:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
gradual abolition process it was
 
06:13:15.150 --> 06:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
06:13:17.468 --> 06:13:17.478 align:start position:0%
end right but we didn't we haven't
 
06:13:20.510 --> 06:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
visited this conversation in 140 years
 
06:13:22.750 --> 06:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
right now we've gone state by state and
 
06:13:24.030 --> 06:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing the abolish
 
06:13:26.430 --> 06:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
slavery national network I'm from New
 
06:13:28.310 --> 06:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
Jersey but I'm leading the campaign in
 
06:13:31.070 --> 06:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
New Jersey we got New York Texas Florida
 
06:13:33.150 --> 06:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
Ohio for the states that have abolished
 
06:13:37.430 --> 06:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
slavery Tennessee Alabama Oregon Vermont
 
06:13:40.830 --> 06:13:40.840 align:start position:0%
um Colorado Nebraska Utah and state byst
 
06:13:42.750 --> 06:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
state we've been correcting the errors
 
06:13:44.868 --> 06:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
of the past and finally closing this
 
06:13:47.030 --> 06:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
chapter in American history so that we
 
06:13:48.468 --> 06:13:48.478 align:start position:0%
can say that we finally live in a
 
06:13:51.708 --> 06:13:51.718 align:start position:0%
country where slavery is
 
06:13:55.628 --> 06:13:55.638 align:start position:0%
over questions further questions uh
 
06:13:57.628 --> 06:13:57.638 align:start position:0%
representative Le
 
06:14:00.190 --> 06:14:00.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chair M how many states have
 
06:14:02.548 --> 06:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
taken up this legislation so far that
 
06:14:03.948 --> 06:14:03.958 align:start position:0%
have passed as constitutional
 
06:14:05.910 --> 06:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
referendums have been six and one of
 
06:14:08.670 --> 06:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
them the seventh was Alabama um through
 
06:14:10.948 --> 06:14:10.958 align:start position:0%
their overall constitutional referendum
 
06:14:13.150 --> 06:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
process agreed to remove the exception
 
06:14:15.350 --> 06:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
Clause from their constitution so eight
 
06:14:17.628 --> 06:14:17.638 align:start position:0%

have the handouts thank you for those as
 
06:14:34.990 --> 06:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
well okay
 
06:14:37.590 --> 06:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh all the other cards they have have
 
06:14:39.510 --> 06:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
asked for two or three minutes except
 
06:14:41.590 --> 06:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
for uh represent wheeler is asked for
 
06:14:43.468 --> 06:14:43.478 align:start position:0%
minimal time I'm not sure what minimal
 
06:14:46.150 --> 06:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
time is but let's go to representative
 
06:14:49.230 --> 06:14:49.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
06:14:51.670 --> 06:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
wheeler well chairman Moffett you know
 
06:14:54.868 --> 06:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
I'm a politician as we all are and a
 
06:14:56.830 --> 06:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
talker so I asked for minimal time
 
06:14:59.628 --> 06:14:59.638 align:start position:0%
instead of an exact number because I'll
 
06:15:01.430 --> 06:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
try to be as brief as I can but I did
 
06:15:03.788 --> 06:15:03.798 align:start position:0%
just want to come before you today and
 
06:15:06.030 --> 06:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
express my support uh for this
 
06:15:08.430 --> 06:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
legislation my name is Jonah wheeler and
 
06:15:10.070 --> 06:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
I represent the towns of petero and
 
06:15:13.310 --> 06:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
Sharon which is Hillsboro District 33 um
 
06:15:18.150 --> 06:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
cacr 13 which is coincidentally uh cacr
 
06:15:21.150 --> 06:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
13 in uh conjunction with 13th Amendment
 
06:15:23.590 --> 06:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
I find that uh kind of interesting but
 
06:15:26.628 --> 06:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
this is a very simple legislation which
 
06:15:30.430 --> 06:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
is at its core a clerical fix to our
 
06:15:33.830 --> 06:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
constitution but I would also echoing
 
06:15:36.830 --> 06:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
the remarks made by representative
 
06:15:38.628 --> 06:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
Balden about the history of this in New
 
06:15:40.830 --> 06:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like to mention that this is
 
06:15:44.390 --> 06:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
still a modern issue in our world and
 
06:15:46.350 --> 06:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
while this legislation doesn't have any
 
06:15:48.788 --> 06:15:48.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement in it and doesn't it won't
 
06:15:51.270 --> 06:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh leave us to to a place where we
 
06:15:53.430 --> 06:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
solve that issue there are still 1.1
 
06:15:55.868 --> 06:15:55.878 align:start position:0%
million people in the United States who
 
06:15:59.590 --> 06:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
are are in slaved or in some form of
 
06:16:02.110 --> 06:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
involuntary servitude whether that be
 
06:16:05.150 --> 06:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
forced Labor uh sexual exploitation of
 
06:16:07.990 --> 06:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
adults or sexual exploitation of
 
06:16:10.750 --> 06:16:10.760 align:start position:0%
children uh 1.1 million people in the
 
06:16:13.468 --> 06:16:13.478 align:start position:0%
United States right now and in 1860
 
06:16:16.510 --> 06:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
there were uh three and a half million
 
06:16:19.390 --> 06:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
people uh enslaved so we're still in a
 
06:16:22.830 --> 06:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
really um shameful moment here I think
 
06:16:24.350 --> 06:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
in in this country and in the way that
 
06:16:25.788 --> 06:16:25.798 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with this and and there are
 
06:16:25.798 --> 06:16:26.670 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with this and and there are
global

06:16:26.670 --> 06:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
global
 
06:16:29.510 --> 06:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
rating indexs that have uh rated the
 
06:16:31.110 --> 06:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
United States on this issue and and
 
06:16:33.670 --> 06:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't rate as high as a
 
06:16:35.990 --> 06:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
nation with the resources that we have
 
06:16:38.788 --> 06:16:38.798 align:start position:0%
should um so I think this is a good
 
06:16:42.510 --> 06:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that as uh Dennis
 
06:16:45.390 --> 06:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
said before me uh eight other states
 
06:16:47.390 --> 06:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
have taken up and many other states are
 
06:16:51.830 --> 06:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
taking up um and and and really this is
 
06:16:55.270 --> 06:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
at its core a reaffirmation of the
 
06:16:57.788 --> 06:16:57.798 align:start position:0%
principled work of the people who fought
 
06:16:59.990 --> 06:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
for our Union the United States of
 
06:17:03.030 --> 06:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
America in the 1860s in the Civil War
 
06:17:05.110 --> 06:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
you hearkening back to the secession
 
06:17:06.750 --> 06:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
bill I wasn't able to testify on that
 
06:17:08.430 --> 06:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
but I am not in favor of that
 
06:17:10.750 --> 06:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
legislation but I I I believe in the
 
06:17:12.750 --> 06:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
United States of America we have a a
 
06:17:15.830 --> 06:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
troubled past uh a troubled history
 
06:17:17.948 --> 06:17:17.958 align:start position:0%
there and troubled people right now our
 
06:17:20.110 --> 06:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
people are feeling uh that troubled
 
06:17:23.430 --> 06:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
nature but this country more than any
 
06:17:26.788 --> 06:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
other can represent uh free freedom for
 
06:17:29.390 --> 06:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
all people life liberty and the pursuit
 
06:17:31.868 --> 06:17:31.878 align:start position:0%
of happiness for all people and and cacr
 
06:17:35.030 --> 06:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
13 for me represents a an affirmation
 
06:17:37.830 --> 06:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
for that principle uh that the state of
 
06:17:39.670 --> 06:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can be making uh making
 
06:17:42.910 --> 06:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
sure that we don't support uh slavery or
 
06:17:47.788 --> 06:17:47.798 align:start position:0%
involuntary servitude in our state uh
 
06:17:50.548 --> 06:17:50.558 align:start position:0%
just to hearken back to the question
 
06:17:52.590 --> 06:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
that you just asked chairman Moffet
 
06:17:55.110 --> 06:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
which I think was a a good question and
 
06:17:57.830 --> 06:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
I I was going to I I know Doc is very
 
06:18:00.390 --> 06:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
diligent about these bills so if they
 
06:18:02.270 --> 06:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
had any opposition to that I'm sure they
 
06:18:03.670 --> 06:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
were here and as soon as I was thinking
 
06:18:07.430 --> 06:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
that my friend from Doc uh Miss Graham
 
06:18:09.230 --> 06:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
came up and and spoke in my shoulder and
 
06:18:11.110 --> 06:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
said that uh it does not affect the
 
06:18:12.910 --> 06:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and and I'm
 
06:18:14.708 --> 06:18:14.718 align:start position:0%
sure she'd be able to to answer that
 
06:18:17.510 --> 06:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
question if you talk to her afterwards
 
06:18:20.390 --> 06:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
um so I think that was as minimal as I
 
06:18:22.468 --> 06:18:22.478 align:start position:0%
can make it chairman Moffett this is New
 
06:18:24.468 --> 06:18:24.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I you guys I appreciate
 
06:18:26.708 --> 06:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
you staying here for for as long as you
 
06:18:28.868 --> 06:18:28.878 align:start position:0%
H you have today this is a one of the
 
06:18:30.230 --> 06:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
long days for you guys and you're
 
06:18:32.390 --> 06:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
putting a lot of work into these bills
 
06:18:34.868 --> 06:18:34.878 align:start position:0%
but I think this is a bipartisan piece
 
06:18:37.788 --> 06:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
of legislation that we can move forward
 
06:18:40.070 --> 06:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar to make sure
 
06:18:42.350 --> 06:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire affirms that slavery
 
06:18:45.190 --> 06:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
and involuntary servitude should not be
 
06:18:47.390 --> 06:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
going on in our world where 40 million
 
06:18:49.868 --> 06:18:49.878 align:start position:0%
people worldwide are enslaved in 1.1
 
06:18:51.468 --> 06:18:51.478 align:start position:0%
million people here in the United States
 
06:18:53.270 --> 06:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
are as well so thank you chairman
 
06:18:55.190 --> 06:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
Moffett and the committee for your time
 
06:18:57.030 --> 06:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate your consideration for
 
06:19:01.110 --> 06:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
cicr 13 thank you for excellent minimal
 
06:19:04.788 --> 06:19:04.798 align:start position:0%
uh uh comment uh comments repent of I I
 
06:19:06.708 --> 06:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
do want to uh comment myself a little
 
06:19:09.150 --> 06:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
bit on a couple things that you said um
 
06:19:11.350 --> 06:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh words the effect early
 
06:19:12.788 --> 06:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
on I made a note of it that this measure
 
06:19:14.468 --> 06:19:14.478 align:start position:0%
by itself won't necessarily solve
 
06:19:16.868 --> 06:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
anything but this is I I have to point
 
06:19:19.150 --> 06:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
out this is not a HR this is not a house
 
06:19:20.708 --> 06:19:20.718 align:start position:0%
resolution and I don't think it can go
 
06:19:23.830 --> 06:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
on consent uh because it is a cacr good
 
06:19:26.030 --> 06:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
point that's a freshman mistake of mine
 
06:19:30.788 --> 06:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
Mr I appreciate so uh as this is a cacr
 
06:19:33.510 --> 06:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh it's very weighty and it would change
 
06:19:35.548 --> 06:19:35.558 align:start position:0%
the law it would change the Constitution
 
06:19:37.270 --> 06:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
if it if it's added so I just wanted to
 
06:19:40.150 --> 06:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
kind of uh make that point that and
 
06:19:41.868 --> 06:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
emphasize this is a
 
06:19:44.310 --> 06:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
cacr um and which I don't think can go
 
06:19:46.430 --> 06:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
on consent I think it would have to be
 
06:19:48.830 --> 06:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
in fact it requires like a 60% vote I
 
06:19:51.708 --> 06:19:51.718 align:start position:0%
have to check my my Civics um so I just
 
06:19:53.830 --> 06:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that point uh questions
 
06:19:57.948 --> 06:19:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:59.628 --> 06:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
well just to your point Mr chairman
 
06:20:01.030 --> 06:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right about that and I
 
06:20:03.110 --> 06:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
apologize for my
 
06:20:05.948 --> 06:20:05.958 align:start position:0%
parliamentary you know flub on that I I
 
06:20:07.190 --> 06:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right this would
 
06:20:09.310 --> 06:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
require two-thirds vote but this is what
 
06:20:10.788 --> 06:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
I meant is this is something that I
 
06:20:12.430 --> 06:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
think that one of those votes on the
 
06:20:14.750 --> 06:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
floor where we'll cheer afterwards
 
06:20:16.070 --> 06:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
because there will be no one who votes
 
06:20:18.830 --> 06:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
against it or almost no one who does so
 
06:20:21.670 --> 06:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
I that's what I mean roll call yes
 
06:20:25.190 --> 06:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
exactly thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:20:27.868 --> 06:20:27.878 align:start position:0%

I'm going to be representing the
 
06:21:15.590 --> 06:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
American civil liberties Union in full
 
06:21:19.628 --> 06:21:19.638 align:start position:0%
support of cacr their te uh I I there's
 
06:21:21.788 --> 06:21:21.798 align:start position:0%
been very extensive and thorough
 
06:21:23.150 --> 06:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that's already been given so
 
06:21:24.910 --> 06:21:24.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go back over that one
 
06:21:26.990 --> 06:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
of the things that I really do think uh
 
06:21:29.230 --> 06:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be noted is that again we are
 
06:21:33.030 --> 06:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
in 2024 now and so uh I do think that
 
06:21:34.750 --> 06:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
this is a common sense legislation and
 
06:21:36.468 --> 06:21:36.478 align:start position:0%
it's a statement um to the community
 
06:21:38.190 --> 06:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
members that we that not only does the
 
06:21:40.628 --> 06:21:40.638 align:start position:0%
legislature support their concerns but
 
06:21:43.030 --> 06:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
we are making this state inclusive for
 
06:21:46.750 --> 06:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
everyone um as far as the involuntary
 
06:21:48.670 --> 06:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
servitude portion was going we heard
 
06:21:50.150 --> 06:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
testimony again about some of the ways
 
06:21:52.070 --> 06:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
that it's employed and I do believe that
 
06:21:53.190 --> 06:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
that is something that should be looked
 
06:21:55.868 --> 06:21:55.878 align:start position:0%
at when we do see County facilities like
 
06:21:58.590 --> 06:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
Valley Street that will specifically um
 
06:22:00.788 --> 06:22:00.798 align:start position:0%
employ practices that were spoken about
 
06:22:03.628 --> 06:22:03.638 align:start position:0%
earlier uh to have individuals partake
 
06:22:05.270 --> 06:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
in things that they necessarily did not
 
06:22:07.548 --> 06:22:07.558 align:start position:0%
want to or may not even be safe for them
 
06:22:10.070 --> 06:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
too but they they're doing so out of
 
06:22:12.548 --> 06:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
fear of Retribution for what could occur
 
06:22:15.390 --> 06:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
if they if they were to not do that uh
 
06:22:17.910 --> 06:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
so I again I wanted to just reinforce
 
06:22:19.430 --> 06:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
that the community of New Hampshire does
 
06:22:21.310 --> 06:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
support this bill and I'm happy to take
 
06:22:22.670 --> 06:22:22.680 align:start position:0%

06:22:25.390 --> 06:22:25.400 align:start position:0%

we are writing this letter in support of
 
06:27:06.190 --> 06:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
cacr 13 2024 an amendment to the New
 
06:27:08.030 --> 06:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution prohibiting
 
06:27:10.788 --> 06:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
slavery and involuntary servitude in the
 
06:27:12.868 --> 06:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire as an
 
06:27:15.070 --> 06:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
organization devoted to disseminating
 
06:27:16.868 --> 06:27:16.878 align:start position:0%
and sharing information about New
 
06:27:19.350 --> 06:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's black history we often are
 
06:27:21.270 --> 06:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
in a position of having to tell our
 
06:27:23.548 --> 06:27:23.558 align:start position:0%
visitors and program participants that
 
06:27:25.830 --> 06:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
slavery has never been formally
 
06:27:28.510 --> 06:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
abolished by the state of New Hampshire
 
06:27:30.868 --> 06:27:30.878 align:start position:0%
enslavement is only prohibited here
 
06:27:32.510 --> 06:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
because of the 13th Amendment to the
 
06:27:36.430 --> 06:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution ratified in
 
06:27:39.390 --> 06:27:39.400 align:start position:0%
1865 the right to be free of the threat
 
06:27:41.990 --> 06:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
of enslavement or involuntary servitude
 
06:27:44.110 --> 06:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
is a cherished and essential right that
 
06:27:45.468 --> 06:27:45.478 align:start position:0%
should be guaranteed by the New
 
06:27:48.230 --> 06:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution the horrors of
 
06:27:50.750 --> 06:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
enslavement in our past alone should be
 
06:27:53.190 --> 06:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
sufficient to compel the passage of this
 
06:27:55.990 --> 06:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
measure what makes its passage essential
 
06:27:58.190 --> 06:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
at this time is that enslavement and
 
06:28:02.150 --> 06:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
involuntary servitude persist even today
 
06:28:05.030 --> 06:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
if enshrined in our constitution it
 
06:28:07.270 --> 06:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
would be possible for anyone aware of
 
06:28:09.230 --> 06:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
violations of this amendment to bring
 
06:28:12.788 --> 06:28:12.798 align:start position:0%
legal action against these practices in
 
06:28:15.910 --> 06:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
addition in our role as teachers of true
 
06:28:18.230 --> 06:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
and holistic history we at the black
 
06:28:21.030 --> 06:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
Heritage Trail would be with the passage
 
06:28:23.868 --> 06:28:23.878 align:start position:0%
of this amendment able to inform our
 
06:28:26.548 --> 06:28:26.558 align:start position:0%
audiences that New Hampshire has taken a
 
06:28:29.310 --> 06:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
stand and its people are now protected
 
06:28:31.390 --> 06:28:31.400 align:start position:0%
from the evils of this despicable
 
06:28:34.430 --> 06:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
practices sincerely Jerry amb bogus
 
06:28:37.150 --> 06:28:37.160 align:start position:0%
executive director and on a personal
 
06:28:39.390 --> 06:28:39.400 align:start position:0%
note I just want to say to the
 
06:28:42.788 --> 06:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
committee as a young individual who has
 
06:28:46.270 --> 06:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
moved here about five six years ago
 
06:28:50.230 --> 06:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
now I was confronted with history that I
 
06:28:53.670 --> 06:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
have never heard before I grew up in the
 
06:28:57.270 --> 06:28:57.280 align:start position:0%
South so a lot of the education that I
 
06:29:00.750 --> 06:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
learned was framed in the eyes of
 
06:29:04.070 --> 06:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
Republican and conservative thought I
 
06:29:05.990 --> 06:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
was taught that the Civil War was about
 
06:29:10.070 --> 06:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
states rights and not about slavery I
 
06:29:12.628 --> 06:29:12.638 align:start position:0%
was taught that these states were the
 
06:29:15.750 --> 06:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
heroes in the story and not the
 
06:29:18.270 --> 06:29:18.280 align:start position:0%
villains it wasn't until I came here to
 
06:29:20.590 --> 06:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I was confronted with
 
06:29:23.430 --> 06:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that an enslaved man Prince
 
06:29:26.430 --> 06:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
Whipple wrote a petion for
 
06:29:31.510 --> 06:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
Freedom so early in the founding of our
 
06:29:36.230 --> 06:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
country that it was impossible to ignore
 
06:29:39.830 --> 06:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
it absolutely reframed my mind on the
 
06:29:41.190 --> 06:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
history of our
 
06:29:43.750 --> 06:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
country I implore you with the passage
 
06:29:46.548 --> 06:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
of this amendment to our constitution it
 
06:29:50.110 --> 06:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
sends a signal not just to everyone in
 
06:29:52.948 --> 06:29:52.958 align:start position:0%
the state but to the rest of the country
 
06:29:56.390 --> 06:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
and the world that we are doing what we
 
06:29:59.590 --> 06:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
can to get rid of the practices and the
 
06:30:02.628 --> 06:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
horrors of our past and move forward so
 
06:30:05.310 --> 06:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
that future Generations can never live
 
06:30:08.430 --> 06:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
under threat again thank you for your
 
06:30:12.070 --> 06:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:16.590 --> 06:30:16.600 align:start position:0%

what we have enshrined in the New
 
06:31:15.670 --> 06:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Constitution Article 10
 
06:31:18.030 --> 06:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
where it says government being
 
06:31:19.590 --> 06:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
instituted for the common benefit
 
06:31:21.150 --> 06:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
protection and security of the whole
 
06:31:22.868 --> 06:31:22.878 align:start position:0%
community and not for the private
 
06:31:24.788 --> 06:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
interest or the ellent of any one man
 
06:31:27.468 --> 06:31:27.478 align:start position:0%

Free or Die have not drawn a clear line
 
06:32:01.150 --> 06:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate which side of slavery we
 
06:32:03.388 --> 06:32:03.398 align:start position:0%
stand on we have not made it clear that
 
06:32:05.110 --> 06:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
we will not support condone or accept
 
06:32:07.310 --> 06:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
slavery of any kind slavery and
 
06:32:09.388 --> 06:32:09.398 align:start position:0%
involuntary servitude are said to have
 
06:32:12.670 --> 06:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
been abolished in 1865 or was it it
 
06:32:14.350 --> 06:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't if we have an exception clause in
 
06:32:16.548 --> 06:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
the 13th Amendment the exception was a
 
06:32:18.510 --> 06:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
way to to continue enslaving blacks
 
06:32:20.230 --> 06:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
without making it appear that's what
 
06:32:22.070 --> 06:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
they were doing those practices have
 
06:32:23.708 --> 06:32:23.718 align:start position:0%
been embedded into the very core of our
 
06:32:26.310 --> 06:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
society a way to justify slavery and
 
06:32:28.868 --> 06:32:28.878 align:start position:0%
involuntary servitude we the people have
 
06:32:31.590 --> 06:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
allowed this to go on far too long I'm
 
06:32:33.110 --> 06:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
taking a stance and stating that the
 
06:32:35.190 --> 06:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
reason we are here today should be clear
 
06:32:36.948 --> 06:32:36.958 align:start position:0%
you are either pro-slavery or
 
06:32:39.310 --> 06:32:39.320 align:start position:0%
anti-slavery there is not an in between
 
06:32:40.510 --> 06:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
there is not a discussion or a
 
06:32:42.430 --> 06:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
conversation that needs to be had how
 
06:32:44.910 --> 06:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
can we proudly say we are the Live Free
 
06:32:46.868 --> 06:32:46.878 align:start position:0%
or Die State all the while making an
 
06:32:49.310 --> 06:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
exception to slavery the answer is we
 
06:32:51.830 --> 06:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
can't there are no exceptions
 
06:32:54.070 --> 06:32:54.080 align:start position:0%

yes not even gonna sit down just wanted
 
06:33:51.030 --> 06:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
to say that on the issue of um the
 
06:33:53.190 --> 06:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
impact on the incarceration on the
 
06:33:56.670 --> 06:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
impact the uh incarceration system it's
 
06:33:58.270 --> 06:33:58.280 align:start position:0%
possible that that would just need to be
 
06:34:00.388 --> 06:34:00.398 align:start position:0%
litigated and that's probably the best
 
06:34:02.830 --> 06:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
way to address it um it's through the
 
06:34:04.868 --> 06:34:04.878 align:start position:0%
court system but other than that you
 
06:34:07.670 --> 06:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
