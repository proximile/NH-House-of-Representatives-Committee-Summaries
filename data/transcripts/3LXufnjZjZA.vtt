good morning everyone
 
00:06:59.809 --> 00:06:59.819 align:start position:0%

recommendations to the full committee
 
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
division two and division three may not
 
00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
be familiar with what division one has
 
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
been doing as each other division is
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
working in their own place after each
 
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
division presentation
 
00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 align:start position:0%

report
 
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
then it will be open to further
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
amendments from the committee members
 
00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
if any member has a prepared amendment
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
to offer the committee they must do so
 
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.730 align:start position:0%
to offer the committee they must do so
today

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
after all the division presentations at
 
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
the end of all votes today please make
 
00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
the following and I will do that
 
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
so we'll begin with division one and
 
00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:43.259 align:start position:0%
I'll represent uh
 
00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:45.830 align:start position:0%
I'll represent uh
I'll recognize

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'll recognize
 
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
representative leishman and Maguire as
 
00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:52.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
to to give them a little help if they
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I'm sure we
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
may need a little help
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
you can see by the size of our packet
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
that we had quite a bit of work to do
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
and we did a lot of work but before I
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
get started I'd like to recognize the
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
two people that really made this
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
successful for us Melissa on my right
 
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
and Mike on my left without the two of
 
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
them we probably still be somewhere else
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
instead of before you
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
Melissa came to us she's new to the
 
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
division but you'd never know it she was
 
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
incredible did a great job
 
00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:38.039 align:start position:0%
and then I'd like to turn to the members
 
00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
of my division
 
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that when the speaker
 
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
asked me to chair The Division I thought
 
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
it was easier when I probably cheered
 
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
the last time when we were in the
 
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
majority but being in the equals so to
 
00:08:55.009 --> 00:08:55.019 align:start position:0%
speak minority majority
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
I thought it might be challenging it
 
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:00.380 align:start position:0%
turned out to be not challenging at all
 
00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
the members were incredible
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin and I was as far
 
00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:07.019 align:start position:0%
as the people sitting here today were
 
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
the only ones returning
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
to division one everybody else was new
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
to division one
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
and the amount of work that we faced was
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
uh at times daunting but we got through
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
it it was very non-partisan I joke with
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
my members that we had the professor
 
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:29.660 align:start position:0%
with us at sitting to my immediate left
 
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
he helped get us through all the tough
 
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
details and again we'll start out and if
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
anyone has any questions feel free to go
 
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
through the chair and we'll try to
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
so Mr chairman I don't know where you'd
 
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
like to start the big document here
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
where we have
 
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
some smaller documents it's it's up to
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
you I guess I leave your choice to you
 
00:09:59.930 --> 00:09:59.940 align:start position:0%
all right well I should recognize we
 
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
have some Replacements with US
 
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:04.700 align:start position:0%
Representative Koval replacing
 
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
representative whole and as usual
 
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
although he's almost a permanent
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
replacement representing grassy
 
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
replacing representative hatch
 
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.009 align:start position:0%
replacing representative hatch
and

00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:16.019 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
we we missing over here oh
 
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.590 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
replacing

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
replacing
 
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:26.519 align:start position:0%
represented Bean
 
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
so what we can do is we'll start with a
 
00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:37.019 align:start position:0%
big packet let's try not to be extremely
 
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
detailed but a lot of this is
 
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:42.140 align:start position:0%
self-explanatory I hope
 
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
but starting with House Bill one
 
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
you'll see we have an amendment um
 
00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:50.579 align:start position:0%
it'll be on page three of your packet
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
we'll start at that location as
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
everybody sure where they are or know
 
00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:56.519 align:start position:0%
where they are
 
00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
so uh you'll see the first amendment is
 
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
a recommendation to abolish three
 
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
positions they're unfunded uh but what
 
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
we're gaining here is we're actually
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
adding two multi-state Auditors uh they
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
will be out there looking for if you
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
will tax cheats or whatever in the big
 
00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:20.459 align:start position:0%
corporate world outside of New Hampshire
 
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
so the dras that we could add a few more
 
00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
people this gives us a positive balance
 
00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:28.019 align:start position:0%
because they will be out there finding
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
additional revenue for the state
 
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.210 align:start position:0%
additional revenue for the state
um

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
going right along we have
 
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
the estimate of unrestricted revenues
 
00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:41.339 align:start position:0%
the division found itself this is on
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
page four
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
I'll try to again if anyone has any
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
questions just you know put your hands
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
up it will slow down
 
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.710 align:start position:0%
up it will slow down
uh

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
so you'll see at the bottom of the page
 
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
representative bucco there's a number
 
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.069 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
so the division found itself in kind of
 
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
an interesting position back on the 12th
 
00:12:09.889 --> 00:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
of March we found that we had between
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
the house bills we were getting and the
 
00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
governor's budget we're about 145
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
million dollars where we shouldn't be so
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
that's why you'll see as we go through
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
this where there's some Cuts going on to
 
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.670 align:start position:0%
this where there's some Cuts going on to
page

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
six of your package we have two doit
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
positions there's a privacy officer an
 
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
administrative positions I believe these
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
were from a bill that representative
 
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:40.100 align:start position:0%
Edwards had introduced at some time
 
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
just kind of buttoning things up and
 
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
bringing some more security to doit
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
so now we go to house bill
 
00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:59.509 align:start position:0%
so now we go to house bill
who

00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
so this item get to the right page here
 
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:05.660 align:start position:0%
that's page seven
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment in your package
 
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.310 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment in your package
that

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
authorizing the Des to seek higher
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
bonding Authority right now it's been
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
limited to three you'll see it's up to
 
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
30 million that's what we're proposing
 
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.730 align:start position:0%
30 million that's what we're proposing
there

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:22.740 align:start position:0%
again if I'm going too fast please sing
 
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.430 align:start position:0%
again if I'm going too fast please sing
out

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:28.019 align:start position:0%
moving on to page eight
 
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
we have an appropriation for PCB
 
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
contamination we have a question
 
00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:35.700 align:start position:0%

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh thank you Mr Sharon thank you
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
um representative alishman I I just uh I
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
was just a little slow on the
 
00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
interpretation on page six for the doit
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
Chief privacy officer and and I had two
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
bills this year that sounded very
 
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
similar to one another one was for the a
 
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
privacy officer for DHHS and a separate
 
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:05.660 align:start position:0%
bill for a security officer for doit
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
neither of those were privacy officers
 
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
for the doit even though they sound
 
00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:15.779 align:start position:0%
similar and so I'm I'm not opposed to
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
this I I just you read into the
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
testimony that this came from one of my
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
bills and and I don't believe that's
 
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
that's accurate
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
all right I apologize I do remember
 
00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion about a
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
privacy officer with your bill so I yeah
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
probably the assumption that I should
 
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
have made that this may have come from
 
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
what you had introduced right right and
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
because on the doit
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
security officer that was already funded
 
00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
that was just putting in the statute the
 
00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:48.839 align:start position:0%
obligations of the security officer the
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
the money for the Privacy officers and
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
DHHS come in division three thank you
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Carol McGuire for a
 
00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.550 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Carol McGuire for a
question

00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
actually it's a comment when we were
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
the uh security officer in Edna we the
 
00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
commissioner of doit mentioned that he
 
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
thought having a Chief privacy officer
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the doit was a good idea and he would
 
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
consider putting it in the budget
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
and so this may have been a request from
 
00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:26.519 align:start position:0%
doit that got in had to be added as an
 
00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:27.470 align:start position:0%
doit that got in had to be added as an
amendment

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
that was my recollection to
 
00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:32.699 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire but hopefully
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
we've cleared it up
 
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative erf has a question
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
I think my question if we're done with
 
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
that one I'd like to ask you a question
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
about section 35 in hb2
 
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
which I think he was just getting to if
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken you have page seven
 
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
could you just speak to the increase
 
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
from three million dollars to 30 million
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
dollars in that Amendment
 
00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
so my memory I recall at the Department
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services said that
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
three million dollars really constrains
 
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
them and they ask it to be raised to a
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
30 million for bonding Authority this
 
00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:08.579 align:start position:0%
was something we did run by the
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
treasurer at the time and she didn't see
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
any particular problem with the request
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
so this is not an appropriation it's a
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's a bonding
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's an author it's a bond authorization
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
amount right they cannot exceed 30
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars thank you
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
and the treasurer usually advises
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
there's another very important bill that
 
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
will come before the the house and that
 
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:34.220 align:start position:0%
will be capital budget which is usually
 
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
hb25 and that's always constrained by
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
six percent of the of the
 
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
total budget or total general fund and
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
education fund budget so they have to
 
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
stay below that
 
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
they have to stay below that when they
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
do any borrowing because it affects the
 
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.100 align:start position:0%
credit rating so I'm sure the treasurer
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
has spoken to them as well on this same
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
one thank you in representative McGuire
 
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
like to add to it yeah so in the
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
original House Bill 2
 
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
it just simply removed the three million
 
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
dollar cap so the cap became unlimited
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
so we decided that unlimited was not
 
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
correct so we we put in this limit
 
00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:22.970 align:start position:0%
correct so we we put in this limit
foreign

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so next we have
 
00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:26.350 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so next we have
the

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
PCB contamination
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
there was a one million dollar sum here
 
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
for uh investigating and Remediation of
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:44.900 align:start position:0%
moving to Amendment nine
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
you'll see this was in section 40 and 41
 
00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:52.799 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 2 and the division felt
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
that creating the office of regulatory
 
00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
review and reduction was not needed it
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
was about a 750 000 request I believe
 
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
for this so we took that out that was in
 
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
so then we moved to page 10
 
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
and it won't go as slow as this because
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
once we get to oplc we'll go through
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:24.419 align:start position:0%
and if any member has a question push a
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
button so I'll see the red light quicker
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
than I might see you nodding or waving
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
so the next one was dealing with
 
00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:34.460 align:start position:0%
historic housing preservation
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
we were looking for additional
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
information on this we did not get it
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
but there was a bill in the Senate that
 
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
has passed I believe it's 231 and the
 
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
Senate put it on their table so there is
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
a like legislation in the senate for
 
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.789 align:start position:0%
a like legislation in the senate for
this

00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
also going to page um let's see tax
 
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.650 align:start position:0%
also going to page um let's see tax
credit

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
credit
 
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
did that one
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
so invest New Hampshire
 
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
there's been some concern that the
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
division cut this by 15 million dollars
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned at the start of this we
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
had to make some Cuts in order to get
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
where we should be
 
00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:22.580 align:start position:0%
I'd like to actually thank
 
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney who added some
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
language in an amendment to take
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
developers out of receiving this money
 
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
and make it more of a grant to
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
communities is that how I interpreted
 
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
that correctly thanks
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
so I think it was a good move but we at
 
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059 align:start position:0%
least kept 15 million dollars in there
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
we made it more of a grant program for
 
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
communities versus a loan program this
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
is new money this is a general fund
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
dollars uh initially all the money that
 
00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
had been put in to invest New Hampshire
 
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
was Federal money so this is a new
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
which as you'll see we also reduced that
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
down to 15 million dollars again we
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
support the
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
program but we just didn't have the
 
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
money to fully fund it at 25 million
 
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.190 align:start position:0%
money to fully fund it at 25 million
dollars

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
the next item we have is on noted as
 
00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:34.970 align:start position:0%
the next item we have is on noted as
page

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
I just have to consult with my chief
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
advisor here my page is not beginning to
 
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
yeah apparently my my numbers there's
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
been so many sheet changes here but so
 
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.970 align:start position:0%
been so many sheet changes here but so
uh

00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
going down so we've gotten through uh 11
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
so on page 12.
 
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299 align:start position:0%
yeah look at them call them they do line
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
up yep
 
00:21:21.289 --> 00:21:21.299 align:start position:0%
uh we have the Department of Correction
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
there's a sum of 10 million dollars for
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
the surveying design completion
 
00:21:30.409 --> 00:21:30.419 align:start position:0%
preliminary work for a new men's State
 
00:21:30.419 --> 00:21:31.909 align:start position:0%
preliminary work for a new men's State
Prison

00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
Prison
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
there was a another amount going to 13
 
00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
where we had an appropriation the
 
00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
governance budget of 40 million dollars
 
00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.270 align:start position:0%
governance budget of 40 million dollars
we

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
didn't feel it 40 million dollars at
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
this point could be funded so we would
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
remove the 40 million dollars from house
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
bill 2. that was for the second stage of
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
the design and work for the men's State
 
00:21:54.480 --> 00:22:05.409 align:start position:0%
the design and work for the men's State
Prison

00:22:05.409 --> 00:22:05.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
so we've had a lot of discussion on the
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
parking garage you probably recall there
 
00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
was house bill 384.
 
00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
uh which appropriated funds for the
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
parking garage that has made it through
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
this Committee in the Full House
 
00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
the appropriation that the governor put
 
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
in was for 15 million dollars so we
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
removed the 15 million dollars from the
 
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
governor's request and
 
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
so moving on to page 15 uh
 
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
this is the Christa McAuliffe memorial
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
fund initially this had been completely
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
removed from House Bill 2 except for the
 
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
creation of this new Commission
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
but with the encouragement of
 
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
Representative evil we put a hundred
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars into the program so we
 
00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
did find it some hopefully there will be
 
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
enough money to get them started
 
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
again that original appropriation was
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
so going to page
 
00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
16 through 28
 
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.010 align:start position:0%
16 through 28
uh

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
this was quite a process for those of
 
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
you that have been following this along
 
00:23:26.649 --> 00:23:26.659 align:start position:0%
this was House Bill
 
00:23:26.659 --> 00:23:28.630 align:start position:0%
this was House Bill
436

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
436
 
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
it came out of the Edna committee with a
 
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
very strong vote and passed on the house
 
00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
floor by 282 to 80.
 
00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:42.539 align:start position:0%
and representative McGuire was very
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
represented Dan McGuire uh was very
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
involved with this whole process as a
 
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
matter of fact that's where we tagged
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
him with the professor of the division
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
because he gave us about an hour and a
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
half lecture on how this works or should
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
work so I don't want to take any of his
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
work away from him so representative
 
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
McGuire I know would like to comment on
 
00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
this one yes thank you so
 
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 436
 
00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:12.059 align:start position:0%
in in the minds of the sponsors writes a
 
00:24:12.059 --> 00:24:13.190 align:start position:0%
in in the minds of the sponsors writes a
wrong

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:24:15.169 --> 00:24:15.179 align:start position:0%
um that we did in the budget 12 years
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
ago 12 years ago we had a very tight
 
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
budget and we needed money and
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
um at the time we were sending a lot of
 
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
money for retirement to communities and
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
and sort of to to compensate a little
 
00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:34.340 align:start position:0%
bit we
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
reduced retirement benefits in some in
 
00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:40.919 align:start position:0%
in a couple of different ways both for
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
group one and but especially for group
 
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.149 align:start position:0%
group one and but especially for group
two

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
and in particular for group two which is
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
police and fire some of which are state
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
employees and but most of them are
 
00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:55.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
for for employees who were at the time
 
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
working but not yet vested
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
um we reduced the multiplier that goes
 
00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:09.299 align:start position:0%
into their pensions so if in general a
 
00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
pension is based on number of years of
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
service times
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
um average final compensation times some
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
particular multiplier and at the time
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
that multiplier for group two was two
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
and a half percent
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
so for the employees who were
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
working at the time but not yet vested
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
that became a ladder for some of them it
 
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:39.299 align:start position:0%
became 2.4 percent 2.3 percent 2.2
 
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
percent 2.1 percent or two percent and
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
then for for new employees were hired
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
after that point it is now two percent
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
so so that's a considerable difference
 
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
right if it had been two and a half
 
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
percent becomes two percent that's
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's a 20 reduction in a pension okay
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
um so this bill
 
00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:06.299 align:start position:0%
restored those for it only affects or
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
primarily affects those employees who
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
were at the time working but not yet
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
vested right there's no change for
 
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
employees who had not yet been hired at
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
that time and no change for those who
 
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
were already vested that those those
 
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
hadn't have been affected so this bill
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill 436 basically for those
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
employees that that particular group and
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
I believe it's roughly 1500 employees
 
00:26:39.169 --> 00:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
both Municipal and state
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
um this bill House Bill 436 puts them
 
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
back on
 
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:47.940 align:start position:0%
um having the same retirement plan they
 
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
had when they were hired
 
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.110 align:start position:0%
had when they were hired
um

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.430 align:start position:0%
um
okay

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.990 align:start position:0%
okay
now

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
um there's one
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
um we made one change to the bill as it
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
came to us because
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and it's not quite the same I mean
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's they're detailed changes but but
 
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
we made one particular change to the
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
bill at the suggestion of the sponsors
 
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
um there's an overall cap on the
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
retirement of these this particular set
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
of employees of a hundred and twenty
 
00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars a year and in the
 
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:28.140 align:start position:0%
original bill that cap was to have been
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
have an escalator so that the cap would
 
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
be raised by one and a quarter percent
 
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
per year over time it affects very few
 
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
employees but it's an expensive number
 
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
and so that that escalation was taken
 
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
out of house bill 36 but other than that
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
this is the same as house bill 36. this
 
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
is the most expensive part of our whole
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
division it's pay for by 25 million
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
dollars a year over a 10-year period so
 
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
this is not just affecting this current
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
biennium 25 million dollars a year so 50
 
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars in this biennium but the
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
next four bienniums another 50 million
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
dollars okay so it's very expensive paid
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
for by General funds
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
um there's also a payment
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
just a little bit extra just to make
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
cities and towns are not affected the
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
the their employer rates are not
 
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:29.700 align:start position:0%
affected by this bill now this
 
00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
particular amendment has a compromise
 
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
because we're spending so much money
 
00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:40.460 align:start position:0%
here over time this all Amendment also
 
00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:44.299 align:start position:0%
restores the communication Services tax
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
that's a tax that raises
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
roughly 56 57 million dollars a year I'm
 
00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:54.539 align:start position:0%
sorry a biennium 28 point something
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year and so it's a
 
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
match for the expenses in House Bill 436
 
00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:02.900 align:start position:0%
over time
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget had eliminated
 
00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:09.980 align:start position:0%
that particular tax as a as a compromise
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
this this amendment also sunsets the
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax one biennium
 
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
early so
 
00:29:23.049 --> 00:29:23.059 align:start position:0%
um so the in current law the the
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax is eliminated
 
00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:31.700 align:start position:0%
on January 1st of 2027 this amendment
 
00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
eliminates it on January 1st of 2025.
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
all right so two years earlier than it
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
would have been otherwise
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
so the net result of this amendment is
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
it makes this particular group of group
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
two employees whole
 
00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.510 align:start position:0%
two employees whole
it

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.430 align:start position:0%
it
um

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
it has a funding mechanism namely the
 
00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
communication tax ongoing to pay for
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
that expense but it does sunset the
 
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax two years
 
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
early I can explain why that's important
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
from economic terms if you like it's
 
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
something I've talked about to the
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
various Ways and Means committees over
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
the years
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
but that's what this amendment does
 
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
representative erf has a question
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
just by way of clarification
 
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.250 align:start position:0%
just by way of clarification
so

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
in HP 2 this refers to 101 to one
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
sections 101 to 110 and I did read your
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment but I couldn't read it top
 
00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.510 align:start position:0%
Amendment but I couldn't read it top
bottom

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
00:30:41.889 --> 00:30:41.899 align:start position:0%
our 101 to 110 deleted in your amendment
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
in their entirety yes those are the
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
sections that that remove the
 
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
okay I mean it talks about all kinds of
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
other things but they're all related to
 
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
the communications and services tax yes
 
00:30:58.990 --> 00:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
because the communication Services tax
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
has kind of little pieces scattered
 
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
throughout law right so you know they're
 
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
in a list of taxes
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
Communications tax so so House Bill 2
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
originally eliminated that so it had a
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
lot of sections because it you know
 
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
takes the name out of this part takes
 
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
the name out of that fire those kind of
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
things thank you representative walner
 
00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
has a question followed by
 
00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.269 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
McGuire

00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:31.490 align:start position:0%
McGuire
so

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
the acceleration of eliminating the IND
 
00:31:39.049 --> 00:31:39.059 align:start position:0%
tax interest and dividends tax have you
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
done some estimates of how much you
 
00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:45.960 align:start position:0%
would estimate the um next biennium will
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
we have done a
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
let's see the analysis that we were able
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
to put together working with the LBA the
 
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:06.020 align:start position:0%
impact on FY 26 is 57 million dollars
 
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
FY 28
 
00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.289 --> 00:32:15.299 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry did I say 28 I meant to say
 
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
but again again 57 for 26 and 25 for 27.
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
but the overall impact of this amendment
 
00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
over the for the next biennium is about
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
a negative 25 million dollars because of
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
the restoration of the communication
 
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
right so those two taxes
 
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
um yes the interest in dividends tax
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
going away is minus
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
75 to 80 million but the restoration of
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax is plus 58 or
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
so million so the net is in the 25
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
million range
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
so representative Stringham followed by
 
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative so in addition to the 85
 
00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:12.779 align:start position:0%
million in the next biennium we're
 
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
looking at about an additional 18
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
million for the interest in dividends
 
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
tax on this this biennium I think that's
 
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
correct and the other two
 
00:33:24.889 --> 00:33:24.899 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just asking you to confirm
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
that and then second really really the
 
00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:28.850 align:start position:0%
that and then second really really the
um

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
uh the hb-436 provision and the CST
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
pretty much balance out especially since
 
00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
CST is anticipated to decline slowly
 
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
does that sound about correct
 
00:33:42.889 --> 00:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
well what uh what we have here again
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the fiscal analysis that was
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
done for uh us concerning 24 and 25
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
the net gain for this biennial would be
 
00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars with the restoration
 
00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
of the communications tax now indeed the
 
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
next biennium will have a a hit but as
 
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
far as this biennium what we've done by
 
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
restoring the communications tax is a
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
um follow-up follow-up is that just in
 
00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
isolation by itself right and not not
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
including the impact of including 436
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
and the change in the IND tax or are you
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
offsetting the IND tax and not hb4 no
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's in isolation a gain of 40
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the biennium okay
 
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
representative tulerski for a question
 
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you representative walner asked
 
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
one question I had my other one was um
 
00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:44.099 align:start position:0%
the communication tax restoration did
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
you get
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
long-term numbers and projections on the
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
decline of that and what we're looking
 
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
at for fiscal year
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
26 and 27.
 
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
we did not we just focused on what we
 
00:34:58.970 --> 00:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
were doing for this biennium
 
00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire would also like
 
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
to weigh you know so the communication
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
tax is a tax on phone calls and text but
 
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:14.339 align:start position:0%
not data so it does not some people
 
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
think it's only on landlines it's not
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
essentially 100 on land lines but on
 
00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:25.619 align:start position:0%
cell phones it's partial because some of
 
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
your cell phone cost is associated with
 
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
data and some is associated with calls
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
and text and so the reason it's
 
00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:35.579 align:start position:0%
declining is because first of all more
 
00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
people are using cell phones unless
 
00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:39.500 align:start position:0%
they're using landlines but also because
 
00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
over time the amount of the cost
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
allocated to a cell phone is lessening
 
00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:50.339 align:start position:0%
on date on talking and and ex and
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
increasing on data but it's not going to
 
00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
you know people still talk on their
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
phone so
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
so I think again just adding a little
 
00:36:13.130 --> 00:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
more to this particular section this is
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
a correction of a wrong that was created
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
back in 2011. I really want to thank the
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
members of my division for coming up
 
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
with I think a very workable solution to
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
fund this
 
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:27.589 align:start position:0%
fund this
um

00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
and again for those taking notes we just
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
got an update from
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
our folks at retirement that will be
 
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.609 align:start position:0%
our folks at retirement that will be
about

00:36:36.609 --> 00:36:36.619 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
1824 people that would be affected by
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
so moving on to page 29 as I promised
 
00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
earlier we'd make some significant jumps
 
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
along the way
 
00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
special injury fund is a special fund
 
00:36:59.569 --> 00:36:59.579 align:start position:0%
that's been around a long time it helps
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
small employers deal with workman's comp
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
claims if they're repeated claims so
 
00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:08.099 align:start position:0%
people are going to work in a claim that
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
may have occurred at another employer
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
isn't coming down on that employers
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
insurance company or that a new employer
 
00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
we heard from a number of folks
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
including some small business New
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Automobile Dealers Association
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
that it asked us to remove this from
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
so page 30.
 
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.450 align:start position:0%
so page 30.
um

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
natural and cultural resources these
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
used to be Park funds what we've done
 
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
here is this will be funded through
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
General funds and no longer Park funds I
 
00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:47.579 align:start position:0%
think we all know our parks are in dire
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
Financial Straits so the decision was
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
made to fund this with General funds
 
00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
versus Park funds and you'll see the
 
00:37:56.569 --> 00:37:56.579 align:start position:0%
amount there is about eight hundred
 
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
thousand a little more than eight
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
so this wasn't this was an add-on
 
00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:05.099 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yeah so as we
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
understand it historically this was
 
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
funded with General funds it was only
 
00:38:14.569 --> 00:38:14.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
so going to 31 this is a very simple
 
00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:20.579 align:start position:0%
change was requested from the Department
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture just to move the meetings
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
to semi-annual versus quarterly and to
 
00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
allow some more public input at those
 
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
particular meetings and no money was
 
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
so yes representative Deanne McGuire
 
00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.619 --> 00:38:50.710 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.390 align:start position:0%
so
oplc

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
you probably have heard a little about
 
00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:58.140 align:start position:0%
this through your emails there were
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
hundreds of sections that were proposed
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget to change
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
I want to personally thank
 
00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
representative Carol McGuire I think
 
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
she's joined us here today just to make
 
00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
sure we do what's right with this
 
00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.790 align:start position:0%
sure we do what's right with this
um

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.099 align:start position:0%
also when her husband Dan worked very
 
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:20.180 align:start position:0%
hard with US representative
 
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
groda was very much involved a ranking
 
00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
member of the Edna committee
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
and what we did is we eliminated the
 
00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:31.820 align:start position:0%
entire section
 
00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:34.820 align:start position:0%
from top to bottom and we started
 
00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
looking at those agencies that we had
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
not heard from minor technical changes
 
00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
but the areas that we heard loud and
 
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
clear from that from so many people
 
00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
around the state those were not put in
 
00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
we thought it more appropriate that Edna
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
take a thorough look we didn't feel that
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
the division could really do its due
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
diligence in such a short period of time
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
to address these changes and I'd like to
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
turn it over to representative McGuire
 
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
who can speak to some of the smaller
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
boards that we did in fact move from the
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office to oplc the
 
00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
other thing that was concerning for us
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
on a financial matter if we took the
 
00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:20.579 align:start position:0%
changes that had been suggested we'd
 
00:40:21.849 --> 00:40:21.859 align:start position:0%
lose about
 
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
998 thousand dollars in general fund
 
00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
money that comes from oplc so there was
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
a financial piece but more importantly
 
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:32.780 align:start position:0%
we turned to e-dna and again and thanks
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire for your
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
leadership and getting us here
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire Dan McGuire okay
 
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
well I could turn it over to the other
 
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
represent let me just explain so first
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
of all
 
00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:49.619 align:start position:0%
um the last bit of what representative
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
leishman said I think is incorrect in
 
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
the sense that
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
um the house passed a bill that makes
 
00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099 align:start position:0%
um oplc an independent independent of
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
the general fund right so they'll be
 
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
they'll be self-funded from their
 
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
licensing fees so that was always that
 
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
was in the house bill too but it's also
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
in a bill that we just passed and so I
 
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
think that from now on anyways that
 
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
licensing will not be they will be
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
charging license fees
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
um equal to their costs so that it will
 
00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
not be a money maker licensing will not
 
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:34.140 align:start position:0%
be a money maker for the general fund
 
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
um in essentially we took out of this
 
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:38.750 align:start position:0%
um in essentially we took out of this
section

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh it I personally think that the
 
00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:43.069 align:start position:0%
uh it I personally think that the
governor's

00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:43.870 align:start position:0%
governor's
um

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
initiative here is well is is was a good
 
00:41:53.329 --> 00:41:53.339 align:start position:0%
one and long overdue we we license we
 
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
have occupational licensing way in
 
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
excess of most other states
 
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
um including our neighboring states like
 
00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.510 align:start position:0%
um including our neighboring states like
Vermont

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
um who have very thoughtful and and
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
limited occupational licensing by
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
comparison to US it's not an area where
 
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
is particularly good in my opinion so so
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
I like the governor's proposal it just
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
turned out to be way too much for our
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
division to process and and deal with
 
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
the level of detail involved it's really
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
something that has to be done by the
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
Edna committee and given all the help
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
they gave us we really cut this down to
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
the to the Bare Bones
 
00:42:44.089 --> 00:42:44.099 align:start position:0%
um the main person who's going to be
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
happy with what we have left is the
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State because the secretary
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
of state will no longer be doing
 
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
licensing for for the a couple of very
 
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
tiny board you know professions that
 
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
that he was dealing with
 
00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:00.770 align:start position:0%
that he was dealing with
um

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
but we've kept
 
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
um a few a few removals there's there's
 
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
in particular there's four very tiny
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
areas that have never caused problems
 
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
that are that are being de-licensed here
 
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
um that's the uh athlete agents the
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
um Hawkers and Peddlers itinerant
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
vendors and one
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
no boxing is being moved to oplc
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
um I think there was one other one
 
00:43:35.089 --> 00:43:35.099 align:start position:0%
oh no Allied Health is not a removal of
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
a license maybe it was just those three
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
yeah so um
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
Allied then there's a couple of sort of
 
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
consolidations in particular Allied
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
Health so Allied Health used to be the
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
the like at oplc of its own there were
 
00:43:53.329 --> 00:43:53.339 align:start position:0%
there were a half a dozen small boards
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
and and Allied Health was kind of an
 
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
extra layer
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
Allied Health previously had been moved
 
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
into a oplc so it was a redundant layer
 
00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
so so one of the things is this that
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
layer is going away there's a few other
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
small cleanup type things but but all
 
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:14.220 align:start position:0%
the the the the changes that were
 
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
getting you hundreds and hundreds of
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
emails those are all gone from this
 
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.250 align:start position:0%
emails those are all gone from this
amendment

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
so it's a very minimal Amendment it it
 
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
does a lot of cleanup but it but not in
 
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
question representative Edwards uh thank
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
you to the uh the McGuire Duo uh in
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
division one I I think this was great
 
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
work I agree with you that the
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
governor's initiative was was bold and
 
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
moves Us in the right direction and I
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
see where you're taking us in this this
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
bite at the Apple what what do you think
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
comes next what you know where are we in
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
the uh okay so what's next we'll let
 
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
Carol McGuire answer that thank you uh
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
the old
 
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
the Edna committee has two retained
 
00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.250 align:start position:0%
the Edna committee has two retained
bills

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:06.260 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
and two Senate bills and several Senate
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
bills coming to us that we're hearing
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
this this coming this week and next
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
so we intend to work first of all on the
 
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
parts that we specifically wanted to
 
00:45:23.329 --> 00:45:23.339 align:start position:0%
take out of house bill to
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
the entire committee was agreed they
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
should not be in House Bill too and
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
that's the restructuring of the mental
 
00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
health boards
 
00:45:34.089 --> 00:45:34.099 align:start position:0%
the psychologists Board of mental health
 
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
latex we have those those three boards
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
have been an issue and so we are going
 
00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
to be working on what we should do about
 
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
them looking at the licensing
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
requirements and the way they operate
 
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
so that's one part we're also looking
 
00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
specifically at the LNA license which
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
the governor wanted to delete but
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
we're not entirely sure that his
 
00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
equivalency with the national
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
certification is right because there are
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
significant differences in scope of
 
00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:14.700 align:start position:0%
practice so those two pieces we're going
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
to be looking at
 
00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
while we look at the Senate bills other
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
items we will continue to look at there
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
is an oplc oversight board that is now
 
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
being formed that we expect to give us
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
other suggestions like making more
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
governing advisory and governing boards
 
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
rather than full-fledged regulatory
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
boards but
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
that's that's a separate issue we expect
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
we'll get to that next year
 
00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative thank you Mr
 
00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:51.470 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative thank you Mr
chair

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
all right I guess we can uh jump down to
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
but actually before I go I Melissa did
 
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
mention to me there was a a house bill
 
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
that passed on consent last week which I
 
00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:15.140 align:start position:0%
must have missed we're thinking it was
 
00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:17.540 align:start position:0%
656 which
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
eliminated the lapsing of oplc so what I
 
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
stated earlier apparently that wouldn't
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
have been the case a week ago but with
 
00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:28.140 align:start position:0%
the passage of this bill now all money
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
will stay within oplc but you could
 
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
probably help us out representative that
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
section was included in house bill 655.
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's also included in house bill for 45
 
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
I believe or 455 which is in Ways and
 
00:47:47.089 --> 00:47:47.099 align:start position:0%
Means at the moment they're considering
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
how to handle the non-lapsing fund
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
oplc has always been self-funded from
 
00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
license fees
 
00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
what many of us are concerned with is
 
00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
that by maintaining fees at a level that
 
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
lapses uh three or four million to the
 
00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:07.140 align:start position:0%
general fund it's becoming a tax rather
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
than a fee and so we want to keep it
 
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
more focused on the ACT at just covering
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
the cost of the actual oplc operations
 
00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
so I think we'll probably look forward
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
to a reduction in licensing fees the
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
first thing we're going that is in
 
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
process is a realignment because some
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
boards are generating a great deal more
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
than they cost and some boards are
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
generating much less than they cost so
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
there will be some realignment expected
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
hey moving on to uh
 
00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
page 56 Mr chairman this was just giving
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate which is within
 
00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
the department of energy
 
00:48:58.970 --> 00:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
the ability to move funds around for
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
consulting or litigation but the
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
transfers are limited to seventy five
 
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
so now we go to page 57 through 58 many
 
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
of you probably recall this was a house
 
00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:18.980 align:start position:0%
bill 347 was introduced by
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative Lind I believe to have a
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
land use judge again this has gone
 
00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:27.500 align:start position:0%
through the process past the house
 
00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
and it's just adding an additional
 
00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the judicial budget later
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
they've added the one additional
 
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
Superior Court Judge to their budget but
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
this specifically was to try to handle
 
00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
the land use cases at this Superior
 
00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:46.150 align:start position:0%
the land use cases at this Superior
Court

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
so going on to page 59 Department of
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
Corrections for position relocation
 
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
allocation again we don't see an awful
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
lot of money here but that's why you're
 
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
seeing the language the governor May
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
draw a warrant for for General funds but
 
00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:12.740 align:start position:0%
again we've had a real problem with
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
Staffing it as you all know at our state
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
prison so this is looking further into
 
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
pay classifications and other
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
Assessments in the Department of
 
00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:28.150 align:start position:0%
Assessments in the Department of
Corrections

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
page 60 again all about expansion
 
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
various the Department of Corrections
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
has put together quite a document
 
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
dealing with Recruitment and Retention
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
again this kind of just ties into the
 
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
again we're still with corrections this
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
is on page 61.
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
this was brought forward by the
 
00:50:57.119 --> 00:50:58.690 align:start position:0%
this was brought forward by the
commissioner

00:50:58.690 --> 00:50:58.700 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
as far as a burial expense trying to
 
00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
help families uh that have lost someone
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
that's worked for the Corrections
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
Department there was a loss recently at
 
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
the Corrections Department and the
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner felt we should at least
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
provide some sort of funding for that
 
00:51:17.569 --> 00:51:17.579 align:start position:0%
expense now it's not to exceed ten
 
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
page 62 we heard from the Department of
 
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:29.700 align:start position:0%
oh sure representative McGuire
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
I just like to comment on the direct
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections
 
00:51:37.130 --> 00:51:37.140 align:start position:0%
um because this isn't a department that
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
is in Dire Straits
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
um their employees they they have
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
roughly 50 percent of the number of
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
correctional officers that they really
 
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
need to run the prisons and so the
 
00:51:51.849 --> 00:51:51.859 align:start position:0%
correctional officers that we do have
 
00:51:56.210 --> 00:51:56.220 align:start position:0%
are working a lot of overtime
 
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
um so when I spoke to says he's working
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
64 hours a week so so 24 hours a week
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
well maybe slightly more of required
 
00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:10.500 align:start position:0%
overtime he has no choice about working
 
00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
overtime and in addition to that parole
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
officers who normally don't work in the
 
00:52:20.089 --> 00:52:20.099 align:start position:0%
prison at all are working up to maybe 16
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
hours or so of overtime and in addition
 
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
to that National Guard members are
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
working in the prison so so they are
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
signifi efficiently shorthanded so so in
 
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
a sense we rather than fund building a
 
00:52:41.089 --> 00:52:41.099 align:start position:0%
new prison we put in as much as they
 
00:52:44.329 --> 00:52:44.339 align:start position:0%
asked for for operations and and
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
improving their situation and operations
 
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
and part of that is going to be getting
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
some of their officers reclassified into
 
00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:55.740 align:start position:0%
higher grade levels so they they can be
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
paid more and hopefully help them with
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
recruiting in that way but this is an
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
area that that really needs help and
 
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
anything we can do just as general
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
advice anything we can do similar to the
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
juvenile case to Res to lower the number
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
of uh people going into prison would be
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
helpful as well so something to think
 
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
about anyway
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's for sure
 
00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:26.220 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards has a question uh
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you mentioned the
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
National Guard have been deployed into
 
00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:34.700 align:start position:0%
the corrections system
 
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
not everyone appreciates that the
 
00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:39.180 align:start position:0%
National Guard come from the community
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
come from employees of the private
 
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
sector or other state agencies and so
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
when they get mobilized they end up
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
being unavailable to work their regular
 
00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:53.579 align:start position:0%
job and so
 
00:53:53.579 --> 00:53:54.170 align:start position:0%
job and so
um

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
so I think it's it's a particularly bad
 
00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
sign when we deploy the State National
 
00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
Guard into a mission like this because
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
it's distracting and they're supposed to
 
00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
be available for for other crises that
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
are not man-made this is a man-made
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
crisis we should try to solve I think
 
00:54:17.569 --> 00:54:17.579 align:start position:0%
it's and then you could make that a
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
question I suppose do you agree yes
 
00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yes thank you the
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
corrections situation is one that
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
essentially convinced me to vote for
 
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
house bill 436.
 
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
Corrections Officers are considered
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
policemen for the purposes of the
 
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
pension system and the state employees
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
who are affected by House Bill 436 are
 
00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly the Corrections Officers
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
not the state police
 
00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.190 align:start position:0%
not the state police
so

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:51.049 --> 00:54:51.059 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
some of the people that most need the
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
pension improvements and we have heard
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
that they are going to stick around a
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
little longer because of House Bill 436
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
and the pension improvements so I hope
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions please
 
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.450 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions please
continue

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman moving on to page
 
00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:18.650 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman moving on to page
62.

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
62.
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
we heard from the Department of
 
00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
Agriculture again this is a bill House
 
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
Bill 230
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
that they were way behind the times and
 
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:28.380 align:start position:0%
as far as their uh
 
00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:31.460 align:start position:0%
electronic licensing and certification
 
00:55:34.609 --> 00:55:34.619 align:start position:0%
registration so this is a one-time ask
 
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
of 360 thousand dollars
 
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
for them they're presently occupy acting
 
00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
and as he said probably the 18th century
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to running their
 
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.609 align:start position:0%
when it comes to running their
Department

00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
moving on to another very important
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
topic that was discussed at length
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
within the division as uh I was built
 
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.890 align:start position:0%
within the division as uh I was built
300

00:55:56.890 --> 00:55:56.900 align:start position:0%
300
 
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
I probably should turn this over to
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
representative evil who was no she's
 
00:56:04.370 --> 00:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
shaking her head no
 
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:07.130 align:start position:0%
shaking her head no
hmm

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
so again this is something that
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative evil and others have
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
worked on for a long period of time uh
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
trying to get a handle on food waste
 
00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
disposal it does create a new position
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Environmental
 
00:56:26.089 --> 00:56:26.099 align:start position:0%
Services for about 98 000 in the second
 
00:56:29.089 --> 00:56:29.099 align:start position:0%
year of the biennium this was a position
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
that was supported overwhelmingly by the
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
waste industry Waste Management I
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
believe they came to testify in others
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
so we thought this was an important ad
 
00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
going next to uh
 
00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:45.140 align:start position:0%
page 65 and 66.
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
I learned something with this one I they
 
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
said they were this is again the
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
National Guard for recruiting and
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
incentive program and they said that
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
money would come from Their fines and I
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
thought they were collecting Their fines
 
00:56:59.930 --> 00:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
for traffic violations and come to find
 
00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:02.339 align:start position:0%
out there are court martials that aren't
 
00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:05.339 align:start position:0%
removal of the offices but fines for
 
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
infractions so that's where the fine
 
00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
language comes from but they're looking
 
00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:12.740 align:start position:0%
to expand their incentive programs for
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
staying or signing up to be with the
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:22.380 align:start position:0%
moving on to page 67 this is food waste
 
00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:24.180 align:start position:0%
reduction and diversion this is another
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
item that was uh
 
00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
looked at very seriously by the division
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
it was a fairly large ask of two million
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
dollars but the division felt we should
 
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:38.339 align:start position:0%
get a handle again on waste and where
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's where and how and especially food
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
waste disposal which we found was uh
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
shocking the amount of tonnage that
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're loading up on our landfills with
 
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
food waste so that's where this came
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
from it came out of the environment and
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.119 --> 00:57:58.430 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
next we have
 
00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.109 align:start position:0%
next we have
page

00:58:02.109 --> 00:58:02.119 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
68 this is requiring The Liquor
 
00:58:09.049 --> 00:58:09.059 align:start position:0%
Commission to at least provide some
 
00:58:11.329 --> 00:58:11.339 align:start position:0%
notice again this is something that I
 
00:58:12.849 --> 00:58:12.859 align:start position:0%
know representative americh
 
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable on in the former chair of
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
the finance committee sitting I think
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
behind me keeping an eye on us but we've
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
just asked on the fiscal committee that
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
we get some notice in advance of closing
 
00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:26.220 align:start position:0%
of liquor stores and the executive
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
Council has actually been added to this
 
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
which we did not have in the original
 
00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:32.579 align:start position:0%
amendment that was offered two years ago
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
by representative Ober that was taken
 
00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.380 align:start position:0%
out by the Senate
 
00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
some years ago we had an item before
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and it was the closing
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
of seven liquor stores and I was reading
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
it at home at the same time I had the
 
00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
annual report of the State Liquor
 
00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:52.140 align:start position:0%
Commission and I looked and it had
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
several years of their sales and whether
 
00:58:57.289 --> 00:58:57.299 align:start position:0%
they were declining or increasing
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
and what do you know the seven liquor
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
stores that were on the list to be
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
closed had all been been declining in
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
sales while almost all the rest and I
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
think there's about 42 almost all the
 
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
rest were increasing in sales so it was
 
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
obvious it was an obvious business
 
00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
decision once you looked at the annual
 
00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
report what was the effect why were they
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
closing these has nothing to do with
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
politics we want to keep politics out of
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
this this is an entrepreneurial fund we
 
00:59:27.049 --> 00:59:27.059 align:start position:0%
want them to make as much money as
 
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
possible so it's it's used for good
 
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:32.220 align:start position:0%
purposes all the money that comes out of
 
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
liquor liquor sales so
 
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
I thought yes they had made good
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
business decisions I saw the evidence of
 
00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
it so I would never question why they
 
00:59:45.049 --> 00:59:45.059 align:start position:0%
closed the store and I don't think we
 
00:59:45.059 --> 00:59:46.010 align:start position:0%
closed the store and I don't think we
should

00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:59:49.069 --> 00:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
I guess this is okay to have a to have
 
00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
some warning especially for the people
 
00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
that are regular patrons but also for
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
the employees and generally they always
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
find a new place for the employees they
 
01:00:01.809 --> 01:00:01.819 align:start position:0%
keep the same numbers liquor stores
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
consistently and as they find a better
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
location they move to it and they get a
 
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
pretty good rate on the rents as well so
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
this this is okay I don't want to see us
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
get too involved in meddling with where
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
the stores are placed thank you
 
01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:00:24.289 --> 01:00:24.299 align:start position:0%
moving on to
 
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
page 69 through 70. uh
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
those of you that are familiar with pfas
 
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
probably everyone has heard of it this
 
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
is changing a few things right now it's
 
01:00:39.470 --> 01:00:39.480 align:start position:0%
a loan if someone has been affected
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking to change it to a response
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
fund two years ago it we put about 25
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
million into this fund there's about 12
 
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars left
 
01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.789 align:start position:0%
million dollars left
so

01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
next one is uh
 
01:01:05.089 --> 01:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
71 page 71 and I'm going to poke a
 
01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
little fun at my colleague to the left
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
you probably recall that there was some
 
01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
excitement on the house floor last week
 
01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:18.140 align:start position:0%
again this house bill 50 which this is
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
sets aside 50 million dollars towards
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability again it did pass
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
last week on the house floor and some
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
people were concerned that
 
01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:29.579 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's moved to table
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
this was a stunt to kill the bill well
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
it was a strategy that's not often used
 
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
but we thought it would work well the
 
01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
house would vote to support this and as
 
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and all of us on
 
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
division want to discuss this we thought
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
it was a way to strengthen our position
 
01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
and then this is just showing yes it is
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
in the budget so for those people that
 
01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:53.339 align:start position:0%
were concerned with the tabling motion
 
01:01:55.970 --> 01:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
that was the strategy and representative
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
McGuire I thought was a pretty good
 
01:01:59.690 --> 01:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
strategy because of the importance of
 
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
this particular item to us on the
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
division treat you like to comment
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
Edwards for a question all right uh
 
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you I I haven't I haven't been
 
01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
following this particular item very
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
closely is this the one that uh goes
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
into a direct payment on our unfunded
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
liability and the effect of that is it
 
01:02:30.770 --> 01:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
will reduce the amount of cost that
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
needs to be shared with the uh the
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
subordinate elements of government and
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
the individuals you're absolutely
 
01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
correct yes so this particular
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
payment will this is actually 2023 funds
 
01:02:47.569 --> 01:02:47.579 align:start position:0%
so so as soon as the budget passes
 
01:02:49.609 --> 01:02:49.619 align:start position:0%
hopefully with this in it
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
um 50 million dollars will will be
 
01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
transferred to the retirement system to
 
01:02:56.809 --> 01:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
pay down the unfunded liability the net
 
01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:00.380 align:start position:0%
effect will be that that the
 
01:03:03.049 --> 01:03:03.059 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the state will pay
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
105 million dollars less over the next
 
01:03:09.049 --> 01:03:09.059 align:start position:0%
couple of decades as we pay down this
 
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
and just just for comparison what is 50
 
01:03:19.609 --> 01:03:19.619 align:start position:0%
million as a as a rough percentage of
 
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
the total unfunded liability it's
 
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:24.059 align:start position:0%
extremely small right yes it's under one
 
01:03:26.089 --> 01:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
percent close to one percent but under
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.329 --> 01:03:38.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
moving a page 72 this is a rim system
 
01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:45.660 align:start position:0%
that you've probably heard about there
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
is an appropriation in the capital
 
01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 24 million dollars it
 
01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
was some concern by the commissioner
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
that there may not be enough funding for
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
this so this gives the department the
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
ability to seek further funds should
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:07.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:04:07.970 --> 01:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
so this next one 73 this was a an
 
01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
amendment that was offered by
 
01:04:17.289 --> 01:04:17.299 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
there as all of you know there's been
 
01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
some concern about getting House Bill 2
 
01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
to us and
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
in a relatively quick fashion so
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler has added this
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
language that not later than February
 
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
15th of the year that the biennium
 
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
session that we should have house bill
 
01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:38.870 align:start position:0%
session that we should have house bill
to

01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:41.180 align:start position:0%
so 74
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
again this was uh it was an awful lot of
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
discussion on this particular items it's
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
a house bill 571 again retirement this
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
was a cost of living adjustment for
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
group two retirees the division made it
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
a one-time
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
contribution towards if you will
 
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
recognizing that people have seen great
 
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
costs increase and group two employees
 
01:05:11.890 --> 01:05:11.900 align:start position:0%
haven't had any adjustment for some time
 
01:05:14.569 --> 01:05:14.579 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire worked on this
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
and came out with what maybe some will
 
01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
say is a difficult scale as far as
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
figuring this out it wasn't everyone
 
01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
gets three thousand dollars at two
 
01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars but representative
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
McGuire worked on a sliding scale which
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
he may like to speak of but the division
 
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
felt it was fair based on time served
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
with a maximum benefit of three thousand
 
01:05:37.609 --> 01:05:37.619 align:start position:0%
dollars I don't know if you'd like to
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
add anything else
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.049 --> 01:06:00.059 align:start position:0%
so 7 76 again an amendment that was off
 
01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
offered by uh representative Weiler this
 
01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
is often uh just clear language as far
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
as it's put in the budget every year uh
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
providing reports to the fiscal
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
Committee of where we stand again normal
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
language I believe
 
01:06:22.849 --> 01:06:22.859 align:start position:0%
quite often requests come to the fiscal
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
committee for another stipend add to a
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
budget normally we say where do you
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
think we're going to get the money from
 
01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
so this way we'll at least know if
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
there's fairly good lapses coming around
 
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
from all the other departments then we
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
know where the money will be coming from
 
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
and we won't be overspending when we
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
approve an item in fiscal thank you
 
01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
the next Amendment which is identified
 
01:06:50.150 --> 01:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
as 77 in your packet this was offered
 
01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:52.140 align:start position:0%
through uh representative Weiler in the
 
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
public works committee
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
something we weren't really familiar
 
01:06:59.329 --> 01:06:59.339 align:start position:0%
with but short-term rentals for the
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
different departments have to go through
 
01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
the Govern Council which holds up
 
01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:05.339 align:start position:0%
projects especially in emergencies so we
 
01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:08.579 align:start position:0%
thought that a waiver could be supported
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
that short-term rentals would not need
 
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative boiler
 
01:07:23.329 --> 01:07:23.339 align:start position:0%
representative Karen McGuire yes thank
 
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
you I'm looking back at on page 76
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
if this report to fiscal is something
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
you it is included in the budget every
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
year why don't we add it to statute
 
01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
well in effect it will it will be in
 
01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
statute when we put it in hb2
 
01:07:50.569 --> 01:07:50.579 align:start position:0%
well I I beg to differ that it it won't
 
01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
many people including many
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
representatives are not aware of chapter
 
01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:01.069 align:start position:0%
representatives are not aware of chapter
law

01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
and find it difficult to find
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
items that are only in chapter law and
 
01:08:08.809 --> 01:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
therefore if this is something that you
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
want every year
 
01:08:13.609 --> 01:08:13.619 align:start position:0%
which sounds perfectly good to me I
 
01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
think it should be under the duties of
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
Services I'd like I'd like to recommend
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
that be the case thank you I will follow
 
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
up by filing a statute next year but the
 
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
problem was
 
01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:28.849 align:start position:0%
problem was
um

01:08:28.849 --> 01:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
you know when we see fiscal where's the
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
money going to come from so anyway
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
so if the chair would like us to go to
 
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:44.339 align:start position:0%
some of the uh
 
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:55.010 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.209 --> 01:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:02.809 --> 01:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
so you'll notice a lot of items have
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
been changed some have not been changed
 
01:09:08.150 --> 01:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
so I'll try to hit some of the more
 
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
significant changes that
 
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
we did by at least adding Personnel or
 
01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
we did address a number of extra wants
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
that were requested by a number of
 
01:09:18.719 --> 01:09:20.890 align:start position:0%
that were requested by a number of
departments

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:20.900 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:09:23.410 --> 01:09:23.420 align:start position:0%
you'll see there's a lot of
 
01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
duplication if you will for doit there's
 
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
one line that goes to dot but it's also
 
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:31.620 align:start position:0%
the funding that comes from the agency
 
01:09:35.329 --> 01:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
to support doit so people get somewhat
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
concerned they think it's double
 
01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
accounting which is just the way
 
01:09:40.729 --> 01:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we do things because doit
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
is all other funds that come from either
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
General funds or federal funds but
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
these are by category of
 
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
of the funds what category is doit
 
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
and you'll see like doit is all other
 
01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
funds but they can in fact be federal or
 
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
general funds uh there were some
 
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
ads as far as trying to strengthen the
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission they had requested
 
01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.729 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission they had requested
additional

01:10:09.729 --> 01:10:09.739 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
add-ons for software development or
 
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
licenses upgrading and maintenance of
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
the existing computer systems if you go
 
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
down to the board of land and tax
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
appeals there were some issues about
 
01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.510 align:start position:0%
appeals there were some issues about
case

01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
management data upgrades that's on line
 
01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.070 align:start position:0%
management data upgrades that's on line
17.

01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
17.
 
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
we talked about this earlier about the
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
support staff needed over at liquor for
 
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
again positions to support their
 
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
next-gen software there are two
 
01:10:46.729 --> 01:10:46.739 align:start position:0%
positions there on line 19 and again if
 
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
I'm going too fast just please put up
 
01:10:50.689 --> 01:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
your hand or
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
press your button so I'll see the red
 
01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.729 align:start position:0%
press your button so I'll see the red
light

01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
again this was mentioned earlier some
 
01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
additional tech support for the
 
01:11:02.890 --> 01:11:02.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration
 
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
so let's see some other uh the
 
01:11:17.330 --> 01:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
Services had a number of requests that
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
were not included in house bill one
 
01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see those on 25 and I think
 
01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
the significant ones there is the space
 
01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:36.900 align:start position:0%
the renovations going on at the annex of
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
about 1.2 million dollars it was
 
01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.250 align:start position:0%
about 1.2 million dollars it was
requested

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
requested
 
01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
the commissioner again of Das made a
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
strong case that we're not keeping up
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
with our facilities in the state needs
 
01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
more money for maintenance roofs that
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
sort of thing upgrades and that is 3.6
 
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the biennium online
 
01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:59.270 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the biennium online
26.

01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
26.
 
01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.950 align:start position:0%
26.
uh

01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see a number of
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
departments there were no change we did
 
01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
make some change with the office of
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
child advocate they needed additional
 
01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
funds for travel they have to attend
 
01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.570 align:start position:0%
funds for travel they have to attend
conferences

01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
conferences
 
01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
out of state their travel line was
 
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
pretty insignificant so we added
 
01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
something there
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
additional training funds and also to
 
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
fund a case management system we were
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
told that they were falling behind on
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
keeping track of these cases which has
 
01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
become problematic so you'll see that
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
additional want there of two hundred
 
01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
then going on to the next significant
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
changes are line 48 Governors page 52
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
again technical specialists
 
01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
that will be with the rim system
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
you'll see going down there vehicle
 
01:13:02.570 --> 01:13:02.580 align:start position:0%
Fleet is in disrepair so they've asked
 
01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
for additional funds for some additional
 
01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:10.980 align:start position:0%
something again it was mentioned earlier
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
with the audit division or two new
 
01:13:15.169 --> 01:13:15.179 align:start position:0%
positions for out-of-state audits again
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
we saw that there'd probably be a
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
significant generator there of Revenue
 
01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
of in the neighborhood of 1.5 to perhaps
 
01:13:24.649 --> 01:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
two million dollars
 
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
again as we you know cruise down through
 
01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
here again they this is a good example
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
going to a board of tax and land appeals
 
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
line uh 65 on page four where I talked
 
01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
about that earlier with the oit there
 
01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
was a line for the 1905 here you see it
 
01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
uh near line so it's a
 
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
they're making the appropriation which
 
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
that amount of money will go over to
 
01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:59.330 align:start position:0%
that amount of money will go over to
doit

01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:00.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:00.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
the other the judicial branch they these
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
were some significant reductions there's
 
01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
quite a few of those that the judicial
 
01:14:11.169 --> 01:14:11.179 align:start position:0%
branch came forward with
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
and we saw no reason to challenge any of
 
01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:15.530 align:start position:0%
and we saw no reason to challenge any of
their

01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:19.930 align:start position:0%
their
reductions

01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
a soil going down again continuing down
 
01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture markets and
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
food that's line 15.
 
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
on a row 15 additional position for a
 
01:14:36.410 --> 01:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
soil conservation position the
 
01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
commissioner made a very strong point
 
01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
that this was a necessary position and
 
01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:42.780 align:start position:0%
we agreed
 
01:14:45.169 --> 01:14:45.179 align:start position:0%
now the Department of Justice had a
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
number of requests that were granted by
 
01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
the governor especially for elderly
 
01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:50.209 align:start position:0%
the governor especially for elderly
um

01:14:50.209 --> 01:14:50.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
abuse it's a becoming a real problem
 
01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
within the state as our population ages
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
we're seeing more and more elderly abuse
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
so the division supported an additional
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
person to work within the elderly of
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
Fraud Unit so this will be an attorney
 
01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
to work within the Department of Justice
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
and this is one of their additional
 
01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
requests that we thought was needed and
 
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:24.659 align:start position:0%
uh the others going down again row 20 is
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
just a simple transfer from the
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice or to the
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice
 
01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Environmental
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
this is we've we felt and it was
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
supported of course by the attorney
 
01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
general that the legal folks should be
 
01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
embedded within the secret of the
 
01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
justice department and not perhaps
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
embedded in the agency but should work
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
directly out of the justice department
 
01:15:57.649 --> 01:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
so this is one of those changes
 
01:15:57.659 --> 01:15:58.910 align:start position:0%
so this is one of those changes
um

01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:01.820 align:start position:0%
then we go to Transportation
 
01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:05.159 align:start position:0%
attorney position for the transportation
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
and construction Bureau so again they'll
 
01:16:09.110 --> 01:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
be working with the Department of
 
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation as far as their legal
 
01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:13.189 align:start position:0%
Transportation as far as their legal
representation

01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
a long spot of no changes Again The
 
01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission I probably see those
 
01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
is uh those were mentioned earlier on
 
01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:27.659 align:start position:0%
the doit section further in the front of
 
01:16:31.729 --> 01:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
so going to page seven uh you see
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
there's no changes in the uh
 
01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
site evaluation public utilities and is
 
01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire mentioned we as a
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
division fully supported Corrections due
 
01:16:51.709 --> 01:16:51.719 align:start position:0%
to their ongoing issue with retention
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
and operating in a state prison system
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
so no change and that's a significant
 
01:16:59.090 --> 01:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
part of our budget all of that is
 
01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
primarily General funds it's a
 
01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
huge chunk of money we don't get a lot
 
01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
of support other than our general tax
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
going uh
 
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
over to the I believe it's almost the
 
01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
last page page eight
 
01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:22.250 align:start position:0%
last page page eight
uh

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:25.090 --> 01:17:25.100 align:start position:0%
there was the Bureau of historic sites
 
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
uh again we spoke about I think that
 
01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:28.910 align:start position:0%
uh again we spoke about I think that
earlier

01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
the moving the fund from hb2 to hb1
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
General funds versus uh
 
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
Park funds
 
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
in an item that has gained a little
 
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
attention and is going down to line nine
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire public television
 
01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
there was a request within Governor's
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
budget for five hundred thousand dollars
 
01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
each year there was a lot of debate
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
within the division but at the end of
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
the day I believe we were unanimous or
 
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
very close to it
 
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
with not recommending the 500 000 as it
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
was a new ask there has not been an
 
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
appropriation for New Hampshire public
 
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
television since representative
 
01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
valencourt was here and moved to have
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
that stricken to evolve funding and that
 
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
uh other issues that just draw your
 
01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
attention to because they're a
 
01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
significant but there are other funds
 
01:18:27.410 --> 01:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
but this will have an impact on going
 
01:18:30.649 --> 01:18:30.659 align:start position:0%
down to line 17 or row 17 Again
 
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh the Winnipesaukee River Basin These
 
01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
funds are collected by the users they're
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
about 10 communities that this is a
 
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant that's around
 
01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
Lake Winnipesaukee towns and like when a
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
Squam about 30 000 users there's some
 
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
deficiencies within the plant uh
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
upgrades that are necessary so the
 
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
department asked that we would support
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
this request again these are funds that
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
will be raised from the users not the
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
state but does require the state to give
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:12.370 --> 01:19:12.380 align:start position:0%
so the others uh
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
going down is uh
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
some I guess
 
01:19:19.729 --> 01:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
the one of the more significant things
 
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh there's hazardous waste cleanup fund
 
01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:25.070 align:start position:0%
uh there's hazardous waste cleanup fund
uh

01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
this is an alignment of including some
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
positions that will be necessary there
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
with the case was made to add some
 
01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.850 align:start position:0%
with the case was made to add some
positions

01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:19:37.130 --> 01:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
to deal with hazardous waste cleanup and
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
also solid waste the solid waste
 
01:19:41.149 --> 01:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
programming probably not aware maybe you
 
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
are that the state has several two I
 
01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:44.950 align:start position:0%
are that the state has several two I
believe

01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:19:48.490 --> 01:19:48.500 align:start position:0%
dumps that are now the responsibility
 
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the state to maintain
 
01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:53.390 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the state to maintain
so

01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
the owners can't be found or located so
 
01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
the state has an obligation to continue
 
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
to monitor those landfills and there is
 
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
so representative McGuire and I are free
 
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
to answer
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
any questions or if we're at a loss
 
01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
which is occasionally does happen we can
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
turn to our LBA staff to bail us out
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
any any remember having a question
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
please push your red button so I can see
 
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
it and identify
 
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
obviously uh
 
01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:31.970 align:start position:0%
obviously uh
okay

01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.649 --> 01:20:33.659 align:start position:0%
representative wildner followed by
 
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham Mike's just
 
01:20:39.649 --> 01:20:39.659 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to ask you to go back up
 
01:20:39.659 --> 01:20:40.790 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to ask you to go back up
to

01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.750 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
line 12 on page eight I just wondered
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
what the um transfer of that position
 
01:20:50.990 --> 01:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
from legal aid to the Department of
 
01:20:53.209 --> 01:20:53.219 align:start position:0%
Justice was I missed I must have missed
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
the description
 
01:20:56.930 --> 01:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.930 --> 01:21:10.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner has gotten a
 
01:21:15.169 --> 01:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
little below the weeds apparently for us
 
01:21:15.179 --> 01:21:16.430 align:start position:0%
little below the weeds apparently for us
so

01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman is going to try to answer
 
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
that question
 
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
has various
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
administratively attached boards and
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
they rely on the Department of Justice
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
for hearings and those sorts of
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
procedural things and this would move a
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
position that was in Environmental
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
Services over to justice for that
 
01:21:40.199 --> 01:21:44.510 align:start position:0%
Services over to justice for that
purpose

01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
yeah if it's okay I'd like to go back to
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
an earlier line is that okay
 
01:21:54.530 --> 01:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
yes sure um we have already included
 
01:21:57.850 --> 01:21:57.860 align:start position:0%
this is follow up on the HB 436
 
01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:02.060 align:start position:0%
Amendment and we had already included
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
inductions in this budget and in a
 
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
biennium where we're seeing real
 
01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
reductions in revenues and increases in
 
01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
cost driven by inflation I would have
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
thought you might have advanced stopping
 
01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
future decreases or at least holding
 
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
future decreases in ID not accelerating
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
the next biennium reductions I think you
 
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
offered to say why you thought that was
 
01:22:29.689 --> 01:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
important and uh I I would like to give
 
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
you an opportunity to talk about that
 
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
um I do think it's very important in my
 
01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
mind the interest in dividends tax is
 
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
the most economically destructive tax
 
01:22:45.850 --> 01:22:45.860 align:start position:0%
that we have and then here's why
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
essentially when when people have money
 
01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
there's two things they can do with it
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
they can spend or they can save and as
 
01:22:59.209 --> 01:22:59.219 align:start position:0%
we know when we tax something we get
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
less of it
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
and the interest in dividends tax is
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
specifically a tax on savings lots of
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
our other taxes our taxes on spending
 
01:23:14.209 --> 01:23:14.219 align:start position:0%
and some taxes are sort of intermediate
 
01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
in the sense that
 
01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
um we don't know what whether their
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
attacks on on spending or savings
 
01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
because there's some combination there
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:26.050 align:start position:0%
for example
um

01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:26.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
let's take the communication tax for
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
example that's a tax on spending right
 
01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
it's a tax on spending on use of phones
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
use of use of communication the tax on
 
01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
business profits and business Enterprise
 
01:23:45.050 --> 01:23:45.060 align:start position:0%
that could be a tax on either we don't
 
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
know if if a business had more money
 
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
would they consume would they would they
 
01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
spend more or would they save would they
 
01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
put money towards capital projects but
 
01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividends tax in
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
particular is a tax on savings its
 
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
attacks on investment
 
01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
and savings and investment in economic
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
terms is what makes tomorrow better than
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
today it's it's in order to if if you
 
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
simply consumed everything you produce
 
01:24:21.370 --> 01:24:21.380 align:start position:0%
so in general you cannot
 
01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
consume more than you produce that right
 
01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
that that produces debt which is sort of
 
01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:27.790 align:start position:0%
that that produces debt which is sort of
negative

01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
negative
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
economic activity but
 
01:24:31.199 --> 01:24:32.030 align:start position:0%
economic activity but
um

01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
if you uh tax savings and have less
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
savings that makes tomorrow not as good
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
as it would have been otherwise right so
 
01:24:45.530 --> 01:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
so when you save money and invest money
 
01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
that makes tomorrow better than today
 
01:24:50.630 --> 01:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
and and in economic terms that's
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
happiness right that's that's
 
01:24:55.490 --> 01:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
um as long as things are better right as
 
01:24:57.410 --> 01:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
if tomorrow's better than today if the
 
01:24:58.970 --> 01:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
day after that is better than that and
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
the day after that is better than that
 
01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
we have a rising standard of living we
 
01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
have Rising incomes and so on
 
01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
If instead we tax savings like the
 
01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax
 
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
we cut down on how good tomorrow is and
 
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
that's making life worse that's making
 
01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
um that's reducing our standard of
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
living compared to what it would have
 
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
been otherwise so in general
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
um we want to increase savings we want
 
01:25:34.490 --> 01:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
to increase the economic activity in the
 
01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
future that makes things better to the
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
extent that we this is another reason
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
why I want to pay down debt faster with
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
things like house bill 50 because to the
 
01:25:48.169 --> 01:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
extent we have debt debt is the opposite
 
01:25:50.689 --> 01:25:50.699 align:start position:0%
of savings and it's making things worse
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the future so so in general economic
 
01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:55.930 align:start position:0%
in the future so so in general economic
terms

01:25:55.930 --> 01:25:55.940 align:start position:0%
terms
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
we want the future better than today and
 
01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.970 align:start position:0%
we want the future better than today and
and

01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:00.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
the the interest in dividends taxes
 
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
please push your mic button so I can see
 
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
the red light
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski for a question
 
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:18.780 align:start position:0%
followed by representative Heath thank
 
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I have a question about
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
a relatively small amount of money on
 
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
page three of the detailed sheet from
 
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
the office of child advocate
 
01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:27.890 align:start position:0%
the office of child advocate
um

01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
we've all
 
01:26:32.110 --> 01:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
seen over the last year or two some
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
tragic cases of
 
01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:36.110 align:start position:0%
tragic cases of
um

01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
involving children in our state
 
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
and I believe a lot of that
 
01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
um was referred to the the case
 
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
management system needing to be upgraded
 
01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
I'm curious if this small amount of two
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand seven hundred dollars
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
was added on to go above and beyond what
 
01:26:55.970 --> 01:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
was allocated in the governor's budget
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
or if the governor's budget just didn't
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
have any funds
 
01:27:01.090 --> 01:27:01.100 align:start position:0%
for this ask
 
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
this was a new ask the governor did not
 
01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
support it so the two hundred thousand
 
01:27:08.209 --> 01:27:08.219 align:start position:0%
dollars is a new they had asked
 
01:27:10.129 --> 01:27:10.139 align:start position:0%
specifically for that amount thank you
 
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
very much sure
 
01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:14.390 align:start position:0%
very much sure
I

01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'd like to add just in general
 
01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of extra in this budget
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
both from the governor and from us
 
01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.810 align:start position:0%
both from the governor and from us
for

01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:27:27.129 --> 01:27:27.139 align:start position:0%
um for it for for
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
adding systems right and and improving
 
01:27:34.149 --> 01:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
um improving the use of computerization
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
and uh for example liquor has a big
 
01:27:42.649 --> 01:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
system that's new dra Das and so on and
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
just in general we have trouble hiring
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
so anything we can do with computer
 
01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:51.780 align:start position:0%
systems to improve productivity means in
 
01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
the future we won't have to hire as much
 
01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
which we're having trouble doing but
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to rely more than we have
 
01:28:02.030 --> 01:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
been in the past on technology so this
 
01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative Heath for a question
 
01:28:08.689 --> 01:28:08.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative at what point does the
 
01:28:16.910 --> 01:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
foreign individual does the IND tax kick
 
01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:20.689 align:start position:0%
foreign individual does the IND tax kick
in

01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
if you're asking
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
specifically there's a
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
um there's a separate
 
01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:30.790 align:start position:0%
um there's a separate
um

01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
there's a limit of different for a
 
01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:36.780 align:start position:0%
single and for couple I don't know
 
01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:38.750 align:start position:0%
single and for couple I don't know
specifically

01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:39.530 align:start position:0%
specifically
um

01:28:39.530 --> 01:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
maybe what I have in the back of my mind
 
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
is twenty four hundred dollars
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
yeah 2400 for an individual 4 800 for a
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
couple worth of that particular kind of
 
01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
income yes
 
01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:55.620 align:start position:0%
and I think it's it's doubled for over
 
01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:59.450 align:start position:0%
and I think it's it's doubled for over
65.

01:28:59.450 --> 01:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:03.530 --> 01:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
I think there's an extra exemption for
 
01:29:08.810 --> 01:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
over 65 I'm not sure if it's doubled or
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
not though thank you
 
01:29:13.330 --> 01:29:13.340 align:start position:0%
so there is one other thing that
 
01:29:15.229 --> 01:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and I thought
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
might be helpful in the entire division
 
01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
for the rest of you to hear we did a
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
deep dive in the governor's request for
 
01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.490 align:start position:0%
deep dive in the governor's request for
a

01:29:24.490 --> 01:29:24.500 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
44.9 million dollar in um
 
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
23 in the uh
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
54 million dollar 24 appropriation it's
 
01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:35.649 align:start position:0%
54 million dollar 24 appropriation it's
section

01:29:35.649 --> 01:29:35.659 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:29:35.659 --> 01:29:37.330 align:start position:0%
section
208

01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:37.340 align:start position:0%
208
 
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
within the house bill too
 
01:29:43.629 --> 01:29:43.639 align:start position:0%
and everybody said well this is a
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money but we asked
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
the department of administrative
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
services to come back to us and give us
 
01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
the real dollar amount as far as the
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
benefit cost those people getting pay
 
01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
raises on other funds federal funds and
 
01:30:03.350 --> 01:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
it has a significant increase which I
 
01:30:04.850 --> 01:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
think you should all be aware of because
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
it was one of the largest items in our
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
review but it doesn't come to the
 
01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
surface because there was no change and
 
01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
so in 24 for all funds for this proposed
 
01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
increase it's 101 million dollars
 
01:30:23.770 --> 01:30:23.780 align:start position:0%
and then in 25
 
01:30:30.110 --> 01:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
the all funds for the increase is 123
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars and I I point that out
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
because it's a significant amount of
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
money but the division was entirely
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
supportive of that and felt that all our
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
employees should get the 10 and 2
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
percent respectively increase
 
01:30:47.689 --> 01:30:47.699 align:start position:0%
moving forward so again I just wanted to
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
make you aware of those numbers because
 
01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
it's a little different than what you
 
01:30:52.729 --> 01:30:52.739 align:start position:0%
may be seeing when you go through House
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 in the specific section
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
also an indication of how many of our
 
01:31:00.290 --> 01:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
employees are paid not through General
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
funds but through Highway funds or fish
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
and game funds or other funds or federal
 
01:31:08.510 --> 01:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
funds so that was kind of overlooked
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
when we first saw the budget because the
 
01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
first pay raise was only shown in
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
general funds thank you that's correct
 
01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:19.729 --> 01:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
I presume Emirate for a question thank
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
when I was on division one I remember
 
01:31:27.290 --> 01:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
working with the commissioner of
 
01:31:29.330 --> 01:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
the prison
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
what's it called come on correction
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
Corrections Corrections thank you very
 
01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:34.129 align:start position:0%
Corrections Corrections thank you very
much

01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:34.139 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
and one of the problems then I'm
 
01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
assuming now was was the turnover in the
 
01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:39.830 align:start position:0%
assuming now was was the turnover in the
guards

01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
guards
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
because they go they get trained about
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
80 percent of the police academy uh and
 
01:31:47.030 --> 01:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
so they did have a little tiny bit to do
 
01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
but then they get hired by the towns to
 
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
go be a police officer
 
01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
so I suggested to the commissioner that
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
she uses that as a hiring strategy
 
01:31:58.729 --> 01:31:58.739 align:start position:0%
join our team for three years and you'll
 
01:32:02.689 --> 01:32:02.699 align:start position:0%
be a graduate police officer
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
so it reality is they're losing their
 
01:32:08.330 --> 01:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
guards outside make it a strategy This
 
01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
is Our intention
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
and if you happen to stay great but what
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
we're hiring you for is go work for
 
01:32:14.810 --> 01:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
somebody else
 
01:32:16.729 --> 01:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
a little tongue-in-cheek but you never
 
01:32:16.739 --> 01:32:17.930 align:start position:0%
a little tongue-in-cheek but you never
know

01:32:17.930 --> 01:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right representative
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
American unfortunately has not changed
 
01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
but the commissioner Helen Hanks is
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
doing a very good job she's put together
 
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
quite a package with her team about
 
01:32:30.890 --> 01:32:30.900 align:start position:0%
retention to try to get us headed in the
 
01:32:33.590 --> 01:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
right direction so they're well aware of
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
and they're they're working hard to turn
 
01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
it around and that's probably a good
 
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
suggestion to put out there as well she
 
01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
I don't see any other red lights
 
01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
I would hope we could do
 
01:32:49.620 --> 01:32:50.149 align:start position:0%
I would hope we could do
um

01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%

01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so
 
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
um we had a house bill House Bill 276
 
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
from representative rung that had to do
 
01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:31.430 align:start position:0%
from representative rung that had to do
with

01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:32.709 align:start position:0%
with
um

01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
funding um creating a new fund to deal
 
01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
with cyanobacteria
 
01:36:42.649 --> 01:36:42.659 align:start position:0%
which is a problem for for lakes and
 
01:36:42.659 --> 01:36:43.250 align:start position:0%
which is a problem for for lakes and
um

01:36:43.250 --> 01:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
and other bodies of water I guess and uh
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
so we're originally the original Bill
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 276 had a very problematic uh
 
01:36:55.729 --> 01:36:55.739 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism it intended to borrow
 
01:36:59.330 --> 01:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
25 million dollars and then give it out
 
01:37:04.370 --> 01:37:04.380 align:start position:0%
as as grants and and possibly loans and
 
01:37:07.189 --> 01:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
and it just it wasn't workable as as it
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
was and we didn't really have time to
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
deal with it so previously we asked this
 
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
committee to retain the bill which you
 
01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:15.770 align:start position:0%
committee to retain the bill which you
did

01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
now uh subsequently last week
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative rung came to me and said
 
01:37:24.770 --> 01:37:24.780 align:start position:0%
could we pass this bill without the
 
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
money in it and I said sure why not and
 
01:37:30.649 --> 01:37:30.659 align:start position:0%
uh but it turns out that a retained
 
01:37:33.649 --> 01:37:33.659 align:start position:0%
motion is something that cannot be
 
01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
reconsidered it's one of those few
 
01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
things that once you do it it's it's
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
done and so
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
um this this amendment would put House
 
01:37:48.110 --> 01:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 276 into House Bill 2 without the
 
01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:49.620 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism this is what
 
01:37:53.689 --> 01:37:53.699 align:start position:0%
representative rung would like and I
 
01:37:56.510 --> 01:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
think we should support it and then she
 
01:37:59.090 --> 01:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
has ideas for how this could be changed
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh together with the senate in the
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
future so
 
01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.930 --> 01:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
I'm a motion by representative McGuire
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
followed or seconded by represent Petrie
 
01:38:21.970 --> 01:38:21.980 align:start position:0%
to adopt Amendment
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is recognized for
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
further come
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
the unleash me whichever you only want
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
I don't know if anybody has any
 
01:38:38.450 --> 01:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
questions if if it's at all confusing
 
01:38:40.729 --> 01:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
representative erf has a question
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
so this talks about setting up a Loan
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
Fund could you just describe how that's
 
01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:46.970 align:start position:0%
Fund could you just describe how that's
funded

01:38:46.970 --> 01:38:46.980 align:start position:0%
funded
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
right so this particular Bill simply
 
01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
creates the fund puts a dollar in it so
 
01:38:56.090 --> 01:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
so there's no money here but they have
 
01:38:59.810 --> 01:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
ideas for how they can make changes to
 
01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
this structure to attract federal funds
 
01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
so but that's something that's going to
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
be worked out with the Senate
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative Miller for a question
 
01:39:15.350 --> 01:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
taking the questions
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
um the language says that those are low
 
01:39:21.110 --> 01:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
interest loans
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
what is the you know standard of and
 
01:39:26.149 --> 01:39:26.159 align:start position:0%
where does the money to make those loans
 
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:35.209 --> 01:39:35.219 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be up to Des and how
 
01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
they decide on those particular details
 
01:39:43.250 --> 01:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion
 
01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
seeing none the clerk will call the roll
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%

to go all the way through uh division
 
01:41:42.530 --> 01:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
two or take a break halfway through what
 
01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
what what's your concept
 
01:41:50.930 --> 01:41:50.940 align:start position:0%

landrigan
 
01:43:11.450 --> 01:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman first I'd like to
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
thank the work of the committee and
 
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
Mickey particularly who kept us honest
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
and on track
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you very much
 
01:43:22.850 --> 01:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to start not jumping into
 
01:43:25.129 --> 01:43:25.139 align:start position:0%
the packet necessarily I I there's every
 
01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
now and again there's something that's
 
01:43:28.129 --> 01:43:28.139 align:start position:0%
quite large and it's like what just
 
01:43:31.729 --> 01:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
happened if you turn to the bill packet
 
01:43:34.370 --> 01:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh page 21
 
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
you will find uh
 
01:43:40.250 --> 01:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1105 and I'm going to do it
 
01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
first because it appears all through our
 
01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
my documentation and if you don't know
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
what it is it looks very strange
 
01:43:50.270 --> 01:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
what this is is the chairman of Finance
 
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
decided we've got to go back to the good
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
old days in the good old days the
 
01:43:57.770 --> 01:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
education trust fund was established
 
01:43:59.930 --> 01:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
because of a court case
 
01:44:02.810 --> 01:44:02.820 align:start position:0%
and it was set up to be funded from
 
01:44:04.490 --> 01:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
various sources
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
over time
 
01:44:09.590 --> 01:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
that satisfied the court and so we move
 
01:44:12.649 --> 01:44:12.659 align:start position:0%
forward with the educational trust fund
 
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
in 2011 I believe when there was a
 
01:44:16.930 --> 01:44:16.940 align:start position:0%
budget crunch
 
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh the educational trust fund which is
 
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
what was a fund that could only be used
 
01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
for education
 
01:44:25.729 --> 01:44:25.739 align:start position:0%
and and did not lapse
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
so it it was had money in it so what the
 
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
the committee did at that time is they
 
01:44:35.090 --> 01:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
took items that had been paid for by
 
01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
General funds and moved them into the
 
01:44:39.950 --> 01:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund and so as time
 
01:44:42.169 --> 01:44:42.179 align:start position:0%
passed more items migrated into the
 
01:44:44.209 --> 01:44:44.219 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund because it was
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
getting more and more money
 
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh and the reason it was so well funded
 
01:44:50.810 --> 01:44:50.820 align:start position:0%
is back in the day when it was
 
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
established there were probably 220 000
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
students in the state
 
01:44:57.890 --> 01:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
and all of these funding sources came in
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
and everything was kind of balanced out
 
01:45:03.890 --> 01:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
uh and it was designed to be just enough
 
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
or not quite enough so that General
 
01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
funds often were used to make up the
 
01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:09.229 align:start position:0%
funds often were used to make up the
balance

01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
balance
 
01:45:12.350 --> 01:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
well over time as the student population
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
drops because when I joined Finance I
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
mean uh yeah financing about nine years
 
01:45:19.609 --> 01:45:19.619 align:start position:0%
ago I think there were about 220 000
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
students today there were numbers are
 
01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
bandied about about a hundred and sixty
 
01:45:28.850 --> 01:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
thousand or 155 000. however the
 
01:45:30.649 --> 01:45:30.659 align:start position:0%
contributions to the fund have never
 
01:45:30.659 --> 01:45:32.030 align:start position:0%
contributions to the fund have never
changed

01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
so the fund gets bigger and bigger and
 
01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
bigger and we Shuffle more and more
 
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
things into the fund uh to try to spend
 
01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
the money down
 
01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:43.139 align:start position:0%
well the chair said enough is enough and
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
put put forth this amendment 1105.
 
01:45:50.109 --> 01:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
what 1105 does is it goes back to
 
01:45:54.770 --> 01:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
setting the moving a lot of the funding
 
01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
out of the educational trust fund into
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
what it does specifically
 
01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
is it modifies contributions from the
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
BPT the business profits tax and the
 
01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax fixes it at
 
01:46:13.250 --> 01:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
twenty two and a half percent each
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh which what this does in the next
 
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
biennium is that it will contribute not
 
01:46:21.530 --> 01:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
contribute it will allocate
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
approximately 222 million dollars in uh
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal uh 24 and in 25
 
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
it will allocate about 225 million
 
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
so what what this does is it moves the
 
01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
money out of the educational trust fund
 
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
into the general fund
 
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
and I if you have any questions we'll
 
01:46:46.250 --> 01:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
ask the chairman I would like to add
 
01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:47.450 align:start position:0%
ask the chairman I would like to add
further

01:46:47.450 --> 01:46:47.460 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:46:51.290 --> 01:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
I was here in 1999 when we created the
 
01:46:53.689 --> 01:46:53.699 align:start position:0%
education trust fund and the adequacy
 
01:46:56.330 --> 01:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
formula we spend a lot of time just
 
01:46:58.669 --> 01:46:58.679 align:start position:0%
deciding what would go into the adequacy
 
01:46:58.679 --> 01:46:59.990 align:start position:0%
deciding what would go into the adequacy
formula

01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
formula
 
01:47:01.970 --> 01:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
and it was only adequacy it wasn't
 
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
special ed it wasn't building Aid it
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't tuition and transportation all
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
those items came out of general fund and
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
so I spent about 20 years on division
 
01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
two and it remained as basically
 
01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:18.169 align:start position:0%
two and it remained as basically
adequacy

01:47:18.169 --> 01:47:18.179 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
after some big tax raises tax increases
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
rather tax decreases both by
 
01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.149 align:start position:0%
rather tax decreases both by
um

01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:29.629 --> 01:47:29.639 align:start position:0%
Federal by Trump on bringing business
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
taxes back from overseas and also the
 
01:47:36.590 --> 01:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
fact that our tax cuts were bringing
 
01:47:40.129 --> 01:47:40.139 align:start position:0%
more more business taxes in so as as the
 
01:47:42.530 --> 01:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
chairman noted
 
01:47:45.169 --> 01:47:45.179 align:start position:0%
the shrinkage of the population we were
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
covering for and the increase in
 
01:47:49.250 --> 01:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
business taxes the governor's budget
 
01:47:51.950 --> 01:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
proposed cutting it from business taxes
 
01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
from 50 percent going to the education
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
trust fund to 35 percent when I looked
 
01:47:59.870 --> 01:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
at all the excesses that were coming in
 
01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:02.219 align:start position:0%
education trust fund I believe we should
 
01:48:04.910 --> 01:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
go back to its historic for over 20
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
years use just for the adequacy so I had
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
LBA reduce it to 22 percent which
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
brought it closer to just covering
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
adequacy it I think it did Cover a few
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
more things but if we have to put money
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
in a trust fund and we end up end up
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
with a surplus that's money we could
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
have used somewhere else but are unable
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
to just as if you wanted if you had a
 
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
surplus in the highway fund you couldn't
 
01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:33.719 align:start position:0%
use it anywhere else same with the fish
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
and game fund so it remains in that fun
 
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
but if we're short somewhere else in
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
general funds it's because we took money
 
01:48:42.890 --> 01:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
out that we did not need to cover
 
01:48:45.709 --> 01:48:45.719 align:start position:0%
adequacy so by going back to its roots
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
and it's it's mostly 20-year history
 
01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's why I put in that Amendment so
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
that the education trust fund would
 
01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
cover what it was always intended and
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
what a historically funded so that's why
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
I put in that Amendment and I thank the
 
01:49:03.410 --> 01:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
Division II for accepting it
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:12.290 --> 01:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm going to start
 
01:49:16.669 --> 01:49:16.679 align:start position:0%
with the hb1 items
 
01:49:18.530 --> 01:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
and I've just got some prepared remarks
 
01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:19.669 align:start position:0%
and I've just got some prepared remarks
here

01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
many of the changes are relative to the
 
01:49:23.810 --> 01:49:23.820 align:start position:0%
budget entry Corrections required by the
 
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
Departments the corrections are detailed
 
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
on Rows 2 3 4 5 11 10 and 11. the other
 
01:49:32.209 --> 01:49:32.219 align:start position:0%
changes recommend by the department of
 
01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
safety and hb1 were not funded in the
 
01:49:36.530 --> 01:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
governor's budget but we're all part of
 
01:49:38.090 --> 01:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
the Department's prioritized needs
 
01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:39.229 align:start position:0%
the Department's prioritized needs

row eight
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
two new program specialist positions to
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
perform Health Care Facility inspections
 
01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:10.860 align:start position:0%
these positions were abolished in the
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
governor's budget from DHHS and were
 
01:50:15.109 --> 01:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
mistakenly omitted from the Fire
 
01:50:17.689 --> 01:50:17.699 align:start position:0%
Marshal's Office budget this was the
 
01:50:20.030 --> 01:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
department of safety's top request these
 
01:50:22.370 --> 01:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
are general fund positions and you're
 
01:50:24.169 --> 01:50:24.179 align:start position:0%
going to see this again because the
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
positions were coming over from HHS
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
row nine one program assistant position
 
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
in the Fire Marshal's Office to help
 
01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
with planning organizing coordinating
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
division of fire safety including
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
administrative rules and processing and
 
01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
responding to requests for in
 
01:50:43.689 --> 01:50:43.699 align:start position:0%
information complying with RSA 91a
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
requests for 91a have increased over the
 
01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
last few years in 2020 the department
 
01:50:53.930 --> 01:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
received 132 91a request in 2021 they
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
received 159 91a requests and they are
 
01:51:02.570 --> 01:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
on track to receive 197 in 2022 nearly
 
01:51:05.930 --> 01:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
a 50 percent increase since 2020. this
 
01:51:07.490 --> 01:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
position would be funded by the fire
 
01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:08.510 align:start position:0%
position would be funded by the fire
fund

01:51:08.510 --> 01:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:51:11.689 --> 01:51:11.699 align:start position:0%
row 12 in DMV provide additional funding
 
01:51:13.790 --> 01:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
to cover credit card processing fees to
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
avoid posting the costs onto customers
 
01:51:18.890 --> 01:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
an item to do this
 
01:51:22.729 --> 01:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
for FY 23 was approved by the fiscal
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
committee March 24th this would be an
 
01:51:27.290 --> 01:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
impact on the highway fund as it would
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
come from DMV's cost to collect
 
01:51:31.970 --> 01:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
administer Highway fund Revenue
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
under Fish and Game
 
01:51:36.109 --> 01:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
the only change recommended is to
 
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
establish a senior accountant accounting
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
technician this is fish of the game Fish
 
01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
and Game funded position the department
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
has a similar position prior to the
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
shared services initiative from a few
 
01:51:48.770 --> 01:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:51:51.050 --> 01:51:51.060 align:start position:0%
duties were owed back to the agency but
 
01:51:53.570 --> 01:51:53.580 align:start position:0%
the position was not which is why they
 
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
requested it for this budget
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
the fish engaged came budget by division
 
01:52:00.530 --> 01:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
two includes approximately 2.5 million
 
01:52:02.590 --> 01:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
of general fund support
 
01:52:06.350 --> 01:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
prior periods support was 1.25 million
 
01:52:08.330 --> 01:52:08.340 align:start position:0%
part of the reason for that is during
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
covet everybody went fishing
 
01:52:12.530 --> 01:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
and they're not fishing so much right
 
01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:15.109 align:start position:0%
and they're not fishing so much right
now

01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.209 --> 01:52:17.219 align:start position:0%
under division two recommendations the
 
01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:19.139 align:start position:0%
fish and game fund balance out of June
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
30th 2025 is expected to be
 
01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
approximately 4.5 million same as the
 
01:52:25.490 --> 01:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
01:52:27.890 --> 01:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation
 
01:52:29.930 --> 01:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
General funds added for the state to

the University of New Hampshire
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
I have no idea
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:54.530 --> 02:00:54.540 align:start position:0%
representative childerski for a question
 
02:00:55.970 --> 02:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question back to page five
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:06.890 --> 02:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
what jumps out at me here is that
 
02:01:09.410 --> 02:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
special education Aid is being moved to
 
02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
the general fund as well as a number of
 
02:01:12.109 --> 02:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
other things
 
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
does this mean in general terms that
 
02:01:16.910 --> 02:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
money that has
 
02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
collected primarily for spending on
 
02:01:18.780 --> 02:01:21.109 align:start position:0%
collected primarily for spending on
education

02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
is going to be moved to the general fund
 
02:01:23.930 --> 02:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
and potentially could be spent on
 
02:01:25.250 --> 02:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
02:01:26.810 --> 02:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
it's restoring it to where it was
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
historically there for 12 or 20 years I
 
02:01:31.850 --> 02:01:31.860 align:start position:0%
have special ed money came from general
 
02:01:34.370 --> 02:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
fund I appreciate that Mr chairman I
 
02:01:37.250 --> 02:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify so that I'm fully
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
understanding the ramifications of this
 
02:01:42.649 --> 02:01:42.659 align:start position:0%
that monies that have been earmarked for
 
02:01:44.689 --> 02:01:44.699 align:start position:0%
certain educational costs such as
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
special education will no longer be held
 
02:01:49.250 --> 02:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
in the education trust fund but will be
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
moved to the general fund to potentially
 
02:01:52.370 --> 02:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
those funds could be spent on anything
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
else it could be
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:01.669 --> 02:02:01.679 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh Heath
 
02:02:05.450 --> 02:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and I've asked you
 
02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
this question before when we made the
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
major move
 
02:02:11.209 --> 02:02:11.219 align:start position:0%
um just my question is with regard to
 
02:02:14.209 --> 02:02:14.219 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom accounts and why
 
02:02:16.370 --> 02:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
in fact they were not moved into the
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
general fund if you would please answer
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
I don't recall where they were moved
 
02:02:26.770 --> 02:02:26.780 align:start position:0%
representative Emrick
 
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
they're still in the educational trust
 
02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:29.870 align:start position:0%
they're still in the educational trust
fund

02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:02:32.689 --> 02:02:32.699 align:start position:0%
because they're part of adequacy
 
02:02:32.699 --> 02:02:34.850 align:start position:0%
because they're part of adequacy
correct

02:02:34.850 --> 02:02:34.860 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:36.290 align:start position:0%
correct
right

02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:39.290 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
members

02:02:39.290 --> 02:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:02:43.370 --> 02:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:45.950 --> 02:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
similar question I'm wondering why court
 
02:02:47.689 --> 02:02:47.699 align:start position:0%
ordered placements
 
02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
for children have been moved into the
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's where they always were
 
02:02:55.609 --> 02:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
and they were under this they were under
 
02:02:57.169 --> 02:02:57.179 align:start position:0%
the special ed when it was generally
 
02:03:02.510 --> 02:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
there is no reduction in money spent for
 
02:03:07.370 --> 02:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
Education we are just putting things
 
02:03:09.770 --> 02:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
back where they always had been this is
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
not any reduction in education this is
 
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
not any harm to education this is
 
02:03:16.970 --> 02:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
putting things back we always funded
 
02:03:16.980 --> 02:03:23.450 align:start position:0%
putting things back we always funded
them

02:03:23.450 --> 02:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:27.050 --> 02:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
is there any further on hb1 from
 
02:03:29.689 --> 02:03:29.699 align:start position:0%
division two
 
02:03:31.129 --> 02:03:31.139 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:03:33.410 --> 02:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
this would be a good place to take a
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
lunch break till about one o'clock and
 
02:03:39.010 --> 02:03:39.020 align:start position:0%
then we'll come back to go over hb2
 
02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:40.250 --> 02:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:40.260 --> 03:06:27.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:06:27.530 --> 03:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:30.590 --> 03:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
everyone with house House Bill 2 from
 
03:06:31.990 --> 03:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
division two
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative Emery
 
03:06:36.769 --> 03:06:36.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman there was a
 
03:06:38.389 --> 03:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
question before lunch about how many
 
03:06:41.269 --> 03:06:41.279 align:start position:0%
students were at unh
 
03:06:44.230 --> 03:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
I have two answers the university system
 
03:06:47.570 --> 03:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
as a whole has approximately 23 000
 
03:06:47.580 --> 03:06:48.830 align:start position:0%
as a whole has approximately 23 000
students

03:06:48.830 --> 03:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:06:51.950 --> 03:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
about 50 percent are in state 50 out of
 
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
state UNH specifically has 15 000
 
03:06:54.840 --> 03:06:57.230 align:start position:0%
state UNH specifically has 15 000
students

03:06:57.230 --> 03:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:06:59.150 --> 03:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:07:01.849 --> 03:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna go a little off script
 
03:07:01.859 --> 03:07:03.230 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna go a little off script
again

03:07:03.230 --> 03:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:07:06.590 --> 03:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
you have a couple of documents one is a
 
03:07:09.050 --> 03:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
horizontal document that has some yellow
 
03:07:09.060 --> 03:07:10.550 align:start position:0%
horizontal document that has some yellow
highlighting

03:07:10.550 --> 03:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
highlighting
 
03:07:13.309 --> 03:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
and the other has several columns this
 
03:07:15.110 --> 03:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
is the adequacy program
 
03:07:18.530 --> 03:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about being
 
03:07:22.429 --> 03:07:22.439 align:start position:0%
funded by the education trust fund so
 
03:07:25.490 --> 03:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do is just uh use the
 
03:07:27.950 --> 03:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
the governor's presentation
 
03:07:30.230 --> 03:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
he'll be served he'll be referred to as
 
03:07:31.730 --> 03:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
the left side of the equation and the
 
03:07:33.230 --> 03:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
right side of the equation
 
03:07:35.269 --> 03:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
if you look at this document that has
 
03:07:37.790 --> 03:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
the yellow highlights you'll see three
 
03:07:40.130 --> 03:07:40.140 align:start position:0%
columns the current law Governor's
 
03:07:42.590 --> 03:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
recommended and then what was Amendment
 
03:07:45.349 --> 03:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
1170 provided for
 
03:07:49.429 --> 03:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh you will notice the
 
03:07:51.530 --> 03:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
current I'm not going to talk about the
 
03:07:52.790 --> 03:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
current law
 
03:07:55.969 --> 03:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
what what you have here in the columns
 
03:07:59.469 --> 03:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
with all cities and towns is what your
 
03:08:02.750 --> 03:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
municipality or your school district can
 
03:08:05.210 --> 03:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
expect under the new Under the new
 
03:08:05.220 --> 03:08:06.710 align:start position:0%
expect under the new Under the new
formula

03:08:06.710 --> 03:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
formula
 
03:08:09.469 --> 03:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
so if you want to get what the governor
 
03:08:11.990 --> 03:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
called a spreadsheet War says something
 
03:08:14.269 --> 03:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
like that get the spreadsheet War out of
 
03:08:16.429 --> 03:08:16.439 align:start position:0%
the way get look it up you know know
 
03:08:17.690 --> 03:08:17.700 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
03:08:17.700 --> 03:08:19.490 align:start position:0%
what's going on
uh

03:08:19.490 --> 03:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:08:21.410 --> 03:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
uh basically what the governor's plan
 
03:08:26.630 --> 03:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
did was it upped the base and the fnr uh
 
03:08:28.849 --> 03:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
as and so
 
03:08:32.210 --> 03:08:32.220 align:start position:0%
what we looked at was is the governor's
 
03:08:35.090 --> 03:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
plan a good plan and by and large the
 
03:08:37.250 --> 03:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
committee felt it was a pretty good plan
 
03:08:40.309 --> 03:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
because they had on what's now the
 
03:08:41.870 --> 03:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
second page
 
03:08:45.670 --> 03:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
which is the right side of the equation
 
03:08:48.950 --> 03:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
the governor did have accelerators for
 
03:08:51.650 --> 03:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
uh communities in Greater need
 
03:08:53.290 --> 03:08:53.300 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:08:56.210 --> 03:08:56.220 align:start position:0%
decided after some encouragement
 
03:08:57.950 --> 03:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to step on the
 
03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
accelerator a little faster
 
03:09:03.170 --> 03:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
than the governor as far as increasing
 
03:09:08.090 --> 03:09:08.100 align:start position:0%
the adequacy for needy towns and that
 
03:09:10.570 --> 03:09:10.580 align:start position:0%
those towns are have
 
03:09:14.870 --> 03:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation and for f r
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
what this does is it puts more money in
 
03:09:20.389 --> 03:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
the in the needier towns quicker than
 
03:09:22.730 --> 03:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
the governor's plan and at a higher
 
03:09:24.830 --> 03:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
level we added 20 million dollars per
 
03:09:26.809 --> 03:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
year or 40 million dollars for the
 
03:09:26.819 --> 03:09:28.670 align:start position:0%
year or 40 million dollars for the
biennium

03:09:28.670 --> 03:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
03:09:31.309 --> 03:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
what this does is if you go to the
 
03:09:32.690 --> 03:09:32.700 align:start position:0%
second page
 
03:09:35.750 --> 03:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
under you see extraordinary need grants
 
03:09:38.090 --> 03:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
under the governor's plan the grants
 
03:09:41.090 --> 03:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
were up to 650 dollars
 
03:09:43.730 --> 03:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
under what was proposed from division
 
03:09:43.740 --> 03:09:44.809 align:start position:0%
under what was proposed from division
two

03:09:44.809 --> 03:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:09:46.570 --> 03:09:46.580 align:start position:0%
grants up to
 
03:09:49.130 --> 03:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
3750 dollars
 
03:09:51.889 --> 03:09:51.899 align:start position:0%
now this is not every student gets three
 
03:09:53.450 --> 03:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
thousand seven hundred fifty dollars
 
03:09:57.790 --> 03:09:57.800 align:start position:0%
they have to qualify to have a
 
03:10:01.010 --> 03:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation under a million
 
03:10:01.020 --> 03:10:02.210 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation under a million
dollars

03:10:02.210 --> 03:10:02.220 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:10:04.670 --> 03:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
and then it if you're over six million
 
03:10:06.650 --> 03:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
dollars you get don't get any of this at
 
03:10:11.330 --> 03:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
all and between those two it it ratchets
 
03:10:15.290 --> 03:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
down the better off your community is
 
03:10:15.300 --> 03:10:16.670 align:start position:0%
down the better off your community is
so

03:10:16.670 --> 03:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:10:18.530 --> 03:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
we didn't change we didn't change a lot
 
03:10:22.309 --> 03:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
the uh we did change the two percent and
 
03:10:24.349 --> 03:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
this was in the governor's plan we did
 
03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
go to two percent annually instead of
 
03:10:29.990 --> 03:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
two percent by on the biennium
 
03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:35.510 align:start position:0%
two percent by on the biennium
um

03:10:35.510 --> 03:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:37.790 --> 03:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
if you want to see the the total the
 
03:10:40.309 --> 03:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
total change in funding
 
03:10:43.849 --> 03:10:43.859 align:start position:0%
on page two the governor's extraordinary
 
03:10:47.809 --> 03:10:47.819 align:start position:0%
needs grants were 89 million and
 
03:10:50.990 --> 03:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry 9 million
 
03:10:54.769 --> 03:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:56.450 --> 03:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
I'm having trouble one of my contacts
 
03:11:03.349 --> 03:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:05.410 --> 03:11:05.420 align:start position:0%
well our our
 
03:11:08.450 --> 03:11:08.460 align:start position:0%
budget goes down because we have higher
 
03:11:13.190 --> 03:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
extraordinary need grants so the
 
03:11:15.530 --> 03:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
money we spend is 40 million dollars and
 
03:11:17.929 --> 03:11:17.939 align:start position:0%
the governor proposed but we allocate it
 
03:11:20.389 --> 03:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
much more heavily to towns that really
 
03:11:21.650 --> 03:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
need it
 
03:11:23.330 --> 03:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
03:11:26.030 --> 03:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
that's the adequacy we did do some also
 
03:11:29.870 --> 03:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
make some changes to sped and uh English
 
03:11:32.030 --> 03:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
language Learners just rounding the
 
03:11:33.530 --> 03:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
numbers that's
 
03:11:38.269 --> 03:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
going from 2079 to 2100 things like that
 
03:11:39.830 --> 03:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
other than that
 
03:11:41.510 --> 03:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
if somebody has some questions on this
 
03:11:44.450 --> 03:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
I'll let Mick answer them
 
03:11:46.070 --> 03:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
push your red button if you have a
 
03:11:46.080 --> 03:11:47.210 align:start position:0%
push your red button if you have a
question

03:11:47.210 --> 03:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:11:49.010 --> 03:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire followed by
 
03:11:51.170 --> 03:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you Mr
 
03:11:54.170 --> 03:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
chairman so the extraordinary need Grant
 
03:11:56.830 --> 03:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
of the 3700
 
03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
50 is that on top of the 2500 on the
 
03:12:04.910 --> 03:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:09.110 --> 03:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
yes okay and may I follow up so
 
03:12:11.389 --> 03:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
do you know roughly how many are in the
 
03:12:14.510 --> 03:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
group on the first page compared to the
 
03:12:18.349 --> 03:12:18.359 align:start position:0%
group on the extraordinary needs Grant
 
03:12:21.650 --> 03:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
I don't understand the question so is
 
03:12:21.660 --> 03:12:22.730 align:start position:0%
I don't understand the question so is
there

03:12:22.730 --> 03:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:12:25.490 --> 03:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
a hundred thousand students in one
 
03:12:28.969 --> 03:12:28.979 align:start position:0%
group and ten thousand in the other or
 
03:12:31.010 --> 03:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
as well how many students are involved
 
03:12:33.530 --> 03:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
some Ford form of extraordinary needs
 
03:12:35.929 --> 03:12:35.939 align:start position:0%
Grant yes
 
03:12:37.790 --> 03:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
don't know don't know and don't know how
 
03:12:40.849 --> 03:12:40.859 align:start position:0%
many on the first page either
 
03:12:40.859 --> 03:12:44.290 align:start position:0%
many on the first page either
spreadsheet

03:12:44.290 --> 03:12:44.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:46.730 --> 03:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't have extraordinary need
 
03:12:46.740 --> 03:12:48.309 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't have extraordinary need
okay

03:12:48.309 --> 03:12:48.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative Heath for a question
 
03:12:52.190 --> 03:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair and thank
 
03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair for taking my question
 
03:12:56.570 --> 03:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
um I think Mickey's probably going to
 
03:12:57.410 --> 03:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
end up
 
03:12:59.269 --> 03:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
um answering this one though
 
03:13:01.730 --> 03:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
um we looking down this list
 
03:13:05.630 --> 03:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
um we see um places like Berlin uh the
 
03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
city of Rochester
 
03:13:08.929 --> 03:13:08.939 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of places that
 
03:13:11.450 --> 03:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
really are not seeing
 
03:13:13.490 --> 03:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
um what we'd hoped that they would see
 
03:13:17.090 --> 03:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
with the proposed um change in the
 
03:13:20.330 --> 03:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
proposal for the funding
 
03:13:23.389 --> 03:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
um I believe that that with the
 
03:13:26.330 --> 03:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
um subtraction of stabilization which I
 
03:13:28.130 --> 03:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
understand has been something that we've
 
03:13:29.570 --> 03:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
been trying to do
 
03:13:32.929 --> 03:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
but um what what do you think we could
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
do in terms of getting some more relief
 
03:13:40.490 --> 03:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
for some of these towns I I just am I
 
03:13:43.010 --> 03:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
have to say I'm really worried about the
 
03:13:45.769 --> 03:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
fact that many of our towns are kind of
 
03:13:47.690 --> 03:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
getting a double whammy based on the
 
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
fact that from 2019 through 2023 we used
 
03:13:55.309 --> 03:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
the same kind of data because of covid
 
03:13:58.670 --> 03:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
and now we're using real-time data as
 
03:14:01.790 --> 03:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
well as a change in the formula so
 
03:14:03.950 --> 03:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
school districts are not only seeing
 
03:14:06.290 --> 03:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
reductions in their fnr because they
 
03:14:07.969 --> 03:14:07.979 align:start position:0%
didn't fill out the white paper forms
 
03:14:10.010 --> 03:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
that they're supposed to fill out
 
03:14:11.330 --> 03:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
03:14:14.269 --> 03:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
um again some the enrollment numbers are
 
03:14:16.670 --> 03:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
lower than they were a lot of kids are
 
03:14:18.530 --> 03:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
coming back to Public Schools but a lot
 
03:14:21.110 --> 03:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
have chosen other options so school
 
03:14:23.330 --> 03:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
districts still have to run their
 
03:14:26.150 --> 03:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
schools they still have a classrooms the
 
03:14:27.889 --> 03:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
same number of classrooms they still
 
03:14:30.889 --> 03:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
have to provide transportation what what
 
03:14:33.290 --> 03:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
could we do what else could we have done
 
03:14:36.889 --> 03:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
in terms of maybe weaving something else
 
03:14:40.370 --> 03:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
into the formula to to give our those
 
03:14:43.250 --> 03:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
towns like Berlin a little bit extra and
 
03:14:45.230 --> 03:14:45.240 align:start position:0%
like Rochester
 
03:14:47.269 --> 03:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
um Mickey I think you're probably going
 
03:14:49.490 --> 03:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
to be the one to answer that let me let
 
03:14:52.070 --> 03:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
me give you for the first part is the
 
03:14:54.889 --> 03:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
fact that the governor's plan and our
 
03:14:57.349 --> 03:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
our plan has hold harmless so nobody's
 
03:14:58.849 --> 03:14:58.859 align:start position:0%
going to get less
 
03:15:02.510 --> 03:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
than they have the previous by any so
 
03:15:02.520 --> 03:15:04.370 align:start position:0%
than they have the previous by any so
now

03:15:04.370 --> 03:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:15:09.170 --> 03:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:09.180 --> 03:15:10.730 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:15:10.730 --> 03:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:15:12.530 --> 03:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
the elimination of the stabilization
 
03:15:15.349 --> 03:15:15.359 align:start position:0%
grant for many communities is not fully
 
03:15:17.750 --> 03:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
made up by the additional Aid infused
 
03:15:19.190 --> 03:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
into the extraordinary needs Grant
 
03:15:21.110 --> 03:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
that's essentially why you see many
 
03:15:24.469 --> 03:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
towns held at zero or using that hold
 
03:15:26.510 --> 03:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
harmless to remain at what the fiscal 24
 
03:15:29.269 --> 03:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
projection was so the examples that you
 
03:15:31.389 --> 03:15:31.399 align:start position:0%
said Berlin Rochester those would be
 
03:15:34.490 --> 03:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
towns that their stabilization grant
 
03:15:35.690 --> 03:15:35.700 align:start position:0%
that they lost
 
03:15:37.370 --> 03:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
was greater than the amount of
 
03:15:39.290 --> 03:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
additional extraordinary needs even with
 
03:15:41.269 --> 03:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
the additional 20 million per year added
 
03:15:46.190 --> 03:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:46.200 --> 03:15:47.590 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:15:47.590 --> 03:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:15:51.650 --> 03:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:55.190 --> 03:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
could we have Incorporated
 
03:15:55.200 --> 03:15:57.110 align:start position:0%
could we have Incorporated
um stabilization

03:15:57.110 --> 03:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
um stabilization
 
03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
um at let's say if we did a quarter a
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
quarter of what it was previously what
 
03:16:06.410 --> 03:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:08.450 --> 03:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
I can't I without being able to run that
 
03:16:11.030 --> 03:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you specifics of course it
 
03:16:13.370 --> 03:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
would have resulted in less hold
 
03:16:15.650 --> 03:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
harmless being required sometimes would
 
03:16:17.330 --> 03:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
have still had a stabilization component
 
03:16:19.849 --> 03:16:19.859 align:start position:0%
to their their adequacy Grant but I
 
03:16:21.650 --> 03:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
can't speak to how many more towns would
 
03:16:23.870 --> 03:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
have received additional Aid if for
 
03:16:25.490 --> 03:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
instance stabilization would remained at
 
03:16:28.490 --> 03:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
25 versus all the way to zero
 
03:16:30.590 --> 03:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
don't forget for many years we've been
 
03:16:32.110 --> 03:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
paying for students who don't exist
 
03:16:35.809 --> 03:16:35.819 align:start position:0%
based upon earlier projections as as the
 
03:16:37.790 --> 03:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
population of students goes down you can
 
03:16:40.190 --> 03:16:40.200 align:start position:0%
expect the money to go down so you can't
 
03:16:41.630 --> 03:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
keep paying for students that don't
 
03:16:43.309 --> 03:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
exist we have done that for several
 
03:16:45.410 --> 03:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
years in several iterations I don't
 
03:16:55.490 --> 03:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:58.370 --> 03:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative papavichi Mueller thank
 
03:17:00.830 --> 03:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman I just wanted to state
 
03:17:03.170 --> 03:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
that we did spend a lot of time in
 
03:17:05.450 --> 03:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
division to trying to find ways to
 
03:17:08.870 --> 03:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
achieve those goals and frankly to
 
03:17:12.110 --> 03:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
summarize all our well to summarize what
 
03:17:14.389 --> 03:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
I learned in that process I don't want
 
03:17:16.670 --> 03:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
to speak for anybody than myself but
 
03:17:19.070 --> 03:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
what I learned is that our current
 
03:17:21.769 --> 03:17:21.779 align:start position:0%
system is so fundamentally broken by the
 
03:17:23.929 --> 03:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
many many patches and Band-Aids that we
 
03:17:26.690 --> 03:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
applied over the years that the only way
 
03:17:26.700 --> 03:17:27.950 align:start position:0%
applied over the years that the only way
to

03:17:27.950 --> 03:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:17:30.790 --> 03:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
help those you know
 
03:17:33.349 --> 03:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
outliers that are not getting the help
 
03:17:35.750 --> 03:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
in here is to put so much money into the
 
03:17:38.150 --> 03:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
system for everybody else that it's
 
03:17:40.010 --> 03:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
beyond the ability that we have to pay
 
03:17:42.110 --> 03:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
for it right now so
 
03:17:44.809 --> 03:17:44.819 align:start position:0%
we do have to fix this formula and I
 
03:17:48.410 --> 03:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
think this is the best achievable way to
 
03:17:51.110 --> 03:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
get there while it may not you know help
 
03:17:53.389 --> 03:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
every community that we'd like to help
 
03:17:55.250 --> 03:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
but we are doing the best we can overall
 
03:17:57.170 --> 03:17:57.180 align:start position:0%
and we try to increase the fairness and
 
03:17:59.210 --> 03:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
address that so it's just a very tough
 
03:18:01.969 --> 03:18:01.979 align:start position:0%
challenge thank you
 
03:18:03.710 --> 03:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
represents string and followed by
 
03:18:05.570 --> 03:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
representative Murray I was wondering if
 
03:18:07.790 --> 03:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
you could comment at all on why the
 
03:18:09.769 --> 03:18:09.779 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant is based on
 
03:18:11.990 --> 03:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
just free and reduced lunch and not
 
03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
general population I go to a place like
 
03:18:16.250 --> 03:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
Berlin there's a four bedroom house for
 
03:18:18.889 --> 03:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
sale for 57 000. go to a place like
 
03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
Newcastle there's nothing available for
 
03:18:24.889 --> 03:18:24.899 align:start position:0%
less than seven figures so uh you know
 
03:18:27.290 --> 03:18:27.300 align:start position:0%
certainly a factor is that the number of
 
03:18:31.490 --> 03:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
students uh per per uh dollar value of
 
03:18:31.500 --> 03:18:32.590 align:start position:0%
students uh per per uh dollar value of
property

03:18:32.590 --> 03:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:18:36.110 --> 03:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
and why is the grant just only targeted
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
free and reduced meal when when towns
 
03:18:40.309 --> 03:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
may not have any students with free and
 
03:18:42.170 --> 03:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
reduced meal are under calculated them
 
03:18:44.750 --> 03:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
may have just as much need my
 
03:18:47.510 --> 03:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
understanding and all that my LBA
 
03:18:49.550 --> 03:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
Pro do it answer the question my
 
03:18:51.349 --> 03:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the equalized
 
03:18:54.830 --> 03:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
valuation and fnr are both woven into
 
03:18:56.210 --> 03:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
the formula
 
03:18:59.389 --> 03:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
and so like Newcastle you know they're
 
03:19:01.670 --> 03:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
they're their valuation could be five
 
03:19:03.769 --> 03:19:03.779 align:start position:0%
million dollars I I'm making it up but I
 
03:19:03.779 --> 03:19:08.210 align:start position:0%
million dollars I I'm making it up but I
mean

03:19:08.210 --> 03:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:10.309 --> 03:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
so the the extraordinary needs Grant is
 
03:19:12.230 --> 03:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
a current law
 
03:19:14.210 --> 03:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
component to the adequacy formula and
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
that was not changed in the governor's
 
03:19:18.950 --> 03:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
proposal nor division two with the
 
03:19:21.469 --> 03:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
exception of that Max Grant so as far as
 
03:19:24.230 --> 03:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
a component that would be equalized
 
03:19:27.710 --> 03:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
valuation per all pupils something
 
03:19:29.150 --> 03:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
existed used to be called fiscal
 
03:19:31.730 --> 03:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity Aid that was that did
 
03:19:34.070 --> 03:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
that that was repealed a couple years
 
03:19:34.080 --> 03:19:35.030 align:start position:0%
that that was repealed a couple years
ago

03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:19:37.010 --> 03:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
and extraordinary needs Grant was put in
 
03:19:39.170 --> 03:19:39.180 align:start position:0%
its place that that merged free and
 
03:19:41.570 --> 03:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
reduce and equalized valuation into one
 
03:19:41.580 --> 03:19:42.830 align:start position:0%
reduce and equalized valuation into one
component

03:19:42.830 --> 03:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
component
 
03:19:44.630 --> 03:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:19:46.969 --> 03:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
president Murray for a question thank
 
03:19:49.010 --> 03:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you and I think
 
03:19:50.990 --> 03:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
you I genuinely thank you for all the
 
03:19:52.790 --> 03:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
work we worked hard on a lot of this the
 
03:19:54.469 --> 03:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
entire committee worked very hard on
 
03:19:57.050 --> 03:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
this but um I feel I have to you know
 
03:20:00.050 --> 03:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
make a point here I heard you say that
 
03:20:01.849 --> 03:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
the goal of this was to try to get
 
03:20:03.590 --> 03:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
additional funds to communities that
 
03:20:05.150 --> 03:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
really needed it the poorer communities
 
03:20:06.950 --> 03:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
that that was one of the things that we
 
03:20:10.190 --> 03:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
considered in putting this together
 
03:20:13.070 --> 03:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
if I'm looking at this I don't find any
 
03:20:14.809 --> 03:20:14.819 align:start position:0%
additional fun going to any of the
 
03:20:16.610 --> 03:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
communities that really really need it
 
03:20:19.370 --> 03:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
and so can I phrase it like this in
 
03:20:21.170 --> 03:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
rather dangerous terms would you agree
 
03:20:23.389 --> 03:20:23.399 align:start position:0%
with me that we did not succeed in
 
03:20:29.630 --> 03:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:32.389 --> 03:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
I have to say I I would hope that we did
 
03:20:35.690 --> 03:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
but much like representative Heath
 
03:20:37.910 --> 03:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like we didn't look like
 
03:20:39.110 --> 03:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
we achieved what we thought we were
 
03:20:39.950 --> 03:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
03:20:42.730 --> 03:20:42.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I appreciate it
 
03:20:45.290 --> 03:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
we did achieve something
 
03:20:45.300 --> 03:20:47.570 align:start position:0%
we did achieve something
but

03:20:47.570 --> 03:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:20:49.670 --> 03:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative hack and Phillip thank
 
03:20:51.010 --> 03:20:51.020 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:20:53.389 --> 03:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:20:55.730 --> 03:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to draw our attention to
 
03:20:57.670 --> 03:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
the last page of the highlighted
 
03:21:00.010 --> 03:21:00.020 align:start position:0%
comparison sheet
 
03:21:02.510 --> 03:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
specifically in the hold harmless Grant
 
03:21:02.520 --> 03:21:04.070 align:start position:0%
specifically in the hold harmless Grant
section

03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:21:06.050 --> 03:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
where I think it's important to
 
03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the grant amount is
 
03:21:11.269 --> 03:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
reduced by 20 over each of the next five
 
03:21:11.279 --> 03:21:12.550 align:start position:0%
reduced by 20 over each of the next five
biennia

03:21:12.550 --> 03:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
biennia
 
03:21:15.230 --> 03:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
and in pointing this out I'd just like
 
03:21:17.150 --> 03:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
to see if you also will agree with me
 
03:21:20.809 --> 03:21:20.819 align:start position:0%
that it is it is true that the folks who
 
03:21:20.819 --> 03:21:22.210 align:start position:0%
that it is it is true that the folks who
do

03:21:22.210 --> 03:21:22.220 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:21:25.670 --> 03:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
receive the benefit of the hold harmless
 
03:21:28.969 --> 03:21:28.979 align:start position:0%
uh Grant in this biennium that we're
 
03:21:31.849 --> 03:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
discussing now will will see a reduction
 
03:21:34.610 --> 03:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
in that hold harmless Grant in the next
 
03:21:37.610 --> 03:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
many bienneas to come so the statement
 
03:21:40.849 --> 03:21:40.859 align:start position:0%
that no one is harmed by by this new
 
03:21:43.309 --> 03:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
calculation is in fact not accurate
 
03:21:45.530 --> 03:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
because they will see a reduction
 
03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the necromium in in the following
 
03:21:50.210 --> 03:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
biennia right well I'm talking about
 
03:21:51.769 --> 03:21:51.779 align:start position:0%
this one
 
03:21:53.450 --> 03:21:53.460 align:start position:0%
somebody else on the hot seat next
 
03:21:58.610 --> 03:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
any further questions from committee
 
03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:08.510 --> 03:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
now we'll get back on script
 
03:22:12.830 --> 03:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
and we'll go to the proposed amendments
 
03:22:15.290 --> 03:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
fairly Hefty packet
 
03:22:15.300 --> 03:22:17.630 align:start position:0%
fairly Hefty packet
uh

03:22:17.630 --> 03:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:22:20.389 --> 03:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
the first item is the appropriation
 
03:22:22.010 --> 03:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
community college system of New
 
03:22:22.020 --> 03:22:22.910 align:start position:0%
community college system of New
Hampshire

03:22:22.910 --> 03:22:22.920 align:start position:0%

03:22:25.130 --> 03:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
dual concurrent enrollment program this
 
03:22:27.290 --> 03:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
is the running Start program
 
03:22:29.630 --> 03:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
where high school students can start
 
03:22:31.610 --> 03:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
gaining college credits while they're
 
03:22:34.130 --> 03:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
still in high school it was represented
 
03:22:36.130 --> 03:22:36.140 align:start position:0%
as a very successful program
 
03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
and and quite Dynamic around the state
 
03:22:43.070 --> 03:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
so we did we did amend it but it's still
 
03:22:45.230 --> 03:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
doing very well
 
03:22:48.110 --> 03:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh appropriation University system of

03:22:51.769 --> 03:22:51.779 align:start position:0%
originally it was came in at eight
 
03:22:54.110 --> 03:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh subsequently the the
 
03:22:56.510 --> 03:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
chancellor came back and said well 6
 
03:22:58.490 --> 03:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
million would be fine there and 2
 
03:23:01.190 --> 03:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
million will move over to our adult
 
03:23:02.690 --> 03:23:02.700 align:start position:0%

University system
 
03:23:07.969 --> 03:23:07.979 align:start position:0%
so uh we approved that one

they're going to try to improve the
 
03:23:31.670 --> 03:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
computer skills of the uh
 
03:23:34.130 --> 03:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
uh teachers so that they'll get a
 
03:23:37.130 --> 03:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
teacher get well trained and go teach
 
03:23:38.990 --> 03:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
other teachers
 
03:23:41.929 --> 03:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
we approve that Department of Education
 
03:23:45.710 --> 03:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
Commission of New Hampshire Civics uh
 
03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
the next two deal with that we didn't
 
03:23:50.510 --> 03:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
really think that the Department of
 
03:23:52.670 --> 03:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
Education really wanted to be in the
 
03:23:54.410 --> 03:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
publishing business this was actually to
 
03:23:55.729 --> 03:23:55.739 align:start position:0%
publish a book
 
03:23:57.290 --> 03:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:24:01.010 --> 03:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
so we left the commission we re
 
03:24:03.170 --> 03:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
restructured the commission so that it
 
03:24:06.950 --> 03:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
has it includes one parent that has a uh
 
03:24:09.830 --> 03:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
pupil in public schools other than that
 
03:24:13.130 --> 03:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
we didn't fund this uh activity Beyond
 
03:24:15.229 --> 03:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
setting up a commission which I know the
 
03:24:18.590 --> 03:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:18.600 --> 03:24:20.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:24:20.210 --> 03:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:23.030 --> 03:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
the next item is the weight permit fees
 
03:24:26.389 --> 03:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
application of receipts all this did was
 
03:24:28.729 --> 03:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
add over height
 
03:24:31.190 --> 03:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
as another one of the items that can be
 
03:24:35.210 --> 03:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
that they can have a fee for because up
 
03:24:37.610 --> 03:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
to that point this was for over length
 
03:24:40.370 --> 03:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
over with but not over height so now we
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:48.410 --> 03:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
and Human Services I mentioned about
 
03:24:52.690 --> 03:24:52.700 align:start position:0%

the Department of Safety
uh

03:24:58.370 --> 03:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:25:00.410 --> 03:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh state budget allocation for gross

03:25:08.990 --> 03:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
I can't even read my own notes
 
03:25:11.630 --> 03:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
it's just so it was suspension of an
 
03:25:14.750 --> 03:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
allocation yeah right yeah we deleted it
 
03:25:17.030 --> 03:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
03:25:17.040 --> 03:25:19.910 align:start position:0%
that's right
um

03:25:19.910 --> 03:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:23.269 --> 03:25:23.279 align:start position:0%

location to 350 percent and another
 
03:25:31.910 --> 03:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
location is still specified 300 so what
 
03:25:34.190 --> 03:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
this what this amendment does is
 
03:25:39.710 --> 03:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:39.720 --> 03:25:41.570 align:start position:0%

uh
 
03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
which we actually retained and
 
03:28:26.269 --> 03:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the budget we talked
 
03:28:27.710 --> 03:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
about that as being nine thousand dollar
 
03:28:30.229 --> 03:28:30.239 align:start position:0%

one
 
03:29:11.570 --> 03:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
we're currently doing this for the snap
 
03:29:15.469 --> 03:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
program and for TANF so this is a pilot
 
03:29:18.229 --> 03:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
program to see if we can do this for uh
 
03:29:20.410 --> 03:29:20.420 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch
 
03:29:23.269 --> 03:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
analysis or numbers
 
03:29:25.969 --> 03:29:25.979 align:start position:0%
as was said the the free and reduced
 
03:29:27.650 --> 03:29:27.660 align:start position:0%
lunch forms are not coming back at a
 
03:29:29.210 --> 03:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
great rate because it's been two years
 
03:29:31.670 --> 03:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
to get untrained about submitting these
 
03:29:34.849 --> 03:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
forms so the fnr is probably going to be
 
03:29:38.630 --> 03:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
down because of the reduced applications
 
03:29:41.830 --> 03:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
page 29.
 
03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
is a subscription to the national
 
03:29:47.269 --> 03:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
student Clearinghouse student tracker
 
03:29:50.630 --> 03:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
program which it was represented it will
 
03:29:52.849 --> 03:29:52.859 align:start position:0%
give more information of what happens
 
03:29:56.570 --> 03:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
with our High School seniors and college
 
03:29:58.849 --> 03:29:58.859 align:start position:0%
matriculation and and we understand
 
03:30:01.370 --> 03:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
Beyond uh
 
03:30:04.309 --> 03:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
so this is a subscription representative
 
03:30:06.349 --> 03:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
Heath has a question I just um I had
 
03:30:08.210 --> 03:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
asked this in committee too and we
 
03:30:11.269 --> 03:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
didn't get an answer can um I don't know
 
03:30:13.610 --> 03:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
if there's somebody here that knows what
 
03:30:16.070 --> 03:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
data set is used to gain that
 
03:30:18.170 --> 03:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
information what's the tracking
 
03:30:21.170 --> 03:30:21.180 align:start position:0%
methodology for the to get the
 
03:30:23.809 --> 03:30:23.819 align:start position:0%
information for the Clearinghouse if
 
03:30:27.349 --> 03:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:29.690 --> 03:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
I think it was Greg Hill that said this
 
03:30:31.849 --> 03:30:31.859 align:start position:0%
was successful he'd heard about it
 
03:30:34.010 --> 03:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
somewhere else I don't know he didn't
 
03:30:36.050 --> 03:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
spell out exactly how they got it but
 
03:30:38.269 --> 03:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
it's he felt it was fairly active I
 
03:30:39.950 --> 03:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
loved I like the program I'm just
 
03:30:41.929 --> 03:30:41.939 align:start position:0%
talking about the data set how they're
 
03:30:45.349 --> 03:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:47.150 --> 03:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll check with the Department a
 
03:30:48.290 --> 03:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
bit thank you
 
03:30:50.210 --> 03:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
representative Mueller do you know the
 
03:30:52.429 --> 03:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
answer my understanding from discussions
 
03:30:54.290 --> 03:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
I was having with the Department of
 
03:30:56.150 --> 03:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
Education but I would still follow up
 
03:30:58.910 --> 03:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
anyway is that the data is reported by
 
03:31:00.650 --> 03:31:00.660 align:start position:0%
the various colleges and basically this
 
03:31:02.150 --> 03:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
is a national program that has a
 
03:31:04.190 --> 03:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse where everybody reports in
 
03:31:06.410 --> 03:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
and they you know match it as well as
 
03:31:08.150 --> 03:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
possible and report back to the states
 
03:31:10.490 --> 03:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
in question but I cannot say that I'm I
 
03:31:12.410 --> 03:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
can go into the nuts and bolts of the
 
03:31:14.210 --> 03:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
details the Department of Education what
 
03:31:19.070 --> 03:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:21.050 --> 03:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
03:31:24.290 --> 03:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
seeing none please proceed okay
 
03:31:27.050 --> 03:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
page 30 is an appropriation community

03:31:32.210 --> 03:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
Workforce credential programs this is
 
03:31:34.729 --> 03:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
two million dollars primarily focused on
 
03:31:37.250 --> 03:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
reducing the cost of re-education for

uh

03:31:46.070 --> 03:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:31:49.370 --> 03:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
the promise the next one on page 31 the
 
03:31:52.330 --> 03:31:52.340 align:start position:0%
promise program is targeted at
 
03:31:56.330 --> 03:31:56.340 align:start position:0%

03:32:08.090 --> 03:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
math learning communities program public
 
03:32:12.050 --> 03:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
secondary schools what this is is a I
 
03:32:14.809 --> 03:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
won't call it remedial math it is making
 
03:32:16.550 --> 03:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
sure that high school students are
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
proficient enough in math to go to
 
03:32:18.960 --> 03:32:20.210 align:start position:0%
proficient enough in math to go to
college

03:32:20.210 --> 03:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
college
 
03:32:22.670 --> 03:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
that's what this program is designed to
 
03:32:22.680 --> 03:32:23.630 align:start position:0%
that's what this program is designed to
do

03:32:23.630 --> 03:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:32:26.030 --> 03:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
and and we passed this already in house
 
03:32:28.370 --> 03:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
bill 419.
 
03:32:30.410 --> 03:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
a general fund transferred to the
 
03:32:32.389 --> 03:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
highway fund when we looked at the
 
03:32:35.150 --> 03:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
highway fund it was starting to kind of
 
03:32:36.830 --> 03:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
scrape the bottom of the barrel
 
03:32:40.550 --> 03:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
and so we decided to appropriate 20
 
03:32:42.410 --> 03:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars to the high oh no 7
 
03:32:45.050 --> 03:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
million 10. I got it
 
03:32:45.060 --> 03:32:46.250 align:start position:0%
million 10. I got it
10.

03:32:46.250 --> 03:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
10.
 
03:32:48.229 --> 03:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
to the highway fund just because they
 
03:32:50.030 --> 03:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
were getting very close and then snow
 
03:32:52.490 --> 03:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
season wasn't quite over yet so
 
03:32:56.929 --> 03:32:56.939 align:start position:0%
and in the past I think last last uh
 
03:32:59.330 --> 03:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
term the Senate actually put 20 million
 
03:33:00.650 --> 03:33:00.660 align:start position:0%
dollars in the highway fund just to keep
 
03:33:00.660 --> 03:33:01.790 align:start position:0%
dollars in the highway fund just to keep
it

03:33:01.790 --> 03:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:33:01.800 --> 03:33:04.550 align:start position:0%
it
solvent

03:33:04.550 --> 03:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
solvent
 
03:33:04.560 --> 03:33:05.870 align:start position:0%
solvent
uh

03:33:05.870 --> 03:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:33:09.229 --> 03:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:13.250 --> 03:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety contact system this
 
03:33:15.769 --> 03:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
is for a system and if if there's people
 
03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
have special needs and there's an
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
emergency people within the safety
 
03:33:22.010 --> 03:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
department knows who those individuals
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
are to provide a additional Aid this was
 
03:33:28.490 --> 03:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
also passed in house bill 560.
 
03:33:30.410 --> 03:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
the last item is the Department of
 
03:33:33.229 --> 03:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
Safety uh the division State Police
 
03:33:37.190 --> 03:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for a bail uh
 
03:33:40.550 --> 03:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
stat condition status what this is is if
 
03:33:41.929 --> 03:33:41.939 align:start position:0%
somebody gets
 
03:33:45.769 --> 03:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
put arrested in Hampton and they have to
 
03:33:49.190 --> 03:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
go into unbail they get bailed out they
 
03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
get in their car and they drive to
 
03:33:52.370 --> 03:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
Laconia they get in trouble in the
 
03:33:52.380 --> 03:33:53.990 align:start position:0%
Laconia they get in trouble in the
cornea

03:33:53.990 --> 03:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
cornea
 
03:33:57.530 --> 03:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
the Laconia bails person doesn't know
 
03:33:59.929 --> 03:33:59.939 align:start position:0%
that that person's already on bail
 
03:34:02.510 --> 03:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
so what this does is it basically is a
 
03:34:04.550 --> 03:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
database of who's on bail
 
03:34:06.110 --> 03:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:34:08.450 --> 03:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
if somebody's already on bail they just
 
03:34:10.130 --> 03:34:10.140 align:start position:0%
violated their bail by doing whatever it
 
03:34:12.769 --> 03:34:12.779 align:start position:0%
is they did to go have to get bail again
 
03:34:15.830 --> 03:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
so that this was a last minute addition
 
03:34:18.110 --> 03:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
to the to the mix and it was
 
03:34:19.610 --> 03:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
appropriated for one million dollars
 
03:34:21.889 --> 03:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
this was a request from the chairman of
 
03:34:24.349 --> 03:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice committee he said
 
03:34:27.290 --> 03:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
he had several other bail bills that
 
03:34:29.150 --> 03:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
were kind of dependent upon this
 
03:34:31.729 --> 03:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
information being available so if we
 
03:34:33.769 --> 03:34:33.779 align:start position:0%
didn't pass this it made several of his
 
03:34:37.130 --> 03:34:37.140 align:start position:0%
other bail bills not very Worthy
 
03:34:39.229 --> 03:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:34:41.110 --> 03:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
and that concludes
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
my formal presentation
 
03:34:47.929 --> 03:34:47.939 align:start position:0%
and I would move the acceptance of hb-1
 
03:34:52.429 --> 03:34:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:56.450 --> 03:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
represent Petrie do you second I do
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative Petrie did you bring
 
03:35:03.229 --> 03:35:03.239 align:start position:0%

on top of it thank you very much
 
03:35:10.070 --> 03:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
so the motion now is to accept the
 
03:35:13.790 --> 03:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
report of division two for hb1 and hb2
 
03:35:16.969 --> 03:35:16.979 align:start position:0%
and after we vote on that we can be
 
03:35:20.269 --> 03:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
entertaining further amendments so is
 
03:35:22.250 --> 03:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
there any questions before we go to that
 
03:35:22.260 --> 03:35:24.290 align:start position:0%

vote

03:35:24.290 --> 03:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
vote

to support the work of this division
 
03:35:34.250 --> 03:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
although there are things in here that I
 
03:35:36.650 --> 03:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
don't like I'm not a fan of
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts
 
03:35:40.969 --> 03:35:40.979 align:start position:0%
but there are things in here there are
 
03:35:44.570 --> 03:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
good additions to our budget process
 
03:35:46.550 --> 03:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
and in all good faith I couldn't vote
 
03:35:49.130 --> 03:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
against this division after the work
 
03:35:50.870 --> 03:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
that was done in my division and the
 
03:35:52.370 --> 03:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
important things that we did so I will
 
03:35:54.590 --> 03:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
be voting yes to support representative
 
03:35:58.370 --> 03:35:58.380 align:start position:0%

03:37:51.769 --> 03:37:51.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
okay representative Maguire moves
 
03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:07.309 --> 03:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:09.950 --> 03:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
Wyler seconds
 
03:38:12.769 --> 03:38:12.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:14.389 --> 03:38:14.399 align:start position:0%
I should have prepped that better I
 
03:38:17.290 --> 03:38:17.300 align:start position:0%
think yeah all right
 
03:38:19.670 --> 03:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
is recognized to explain the amendment
 
03:38:22.130 --> 03:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much so
 
03:38:25.790 --> 03:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
um this removes the Whittemore Center
 
03:38:27.710 --> 03:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
um six million dollar
 
03:38:31.190 --> 03:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation from which is I believe
 
03:38:33.530 --> 03:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
section well it was originally section
 
03:38:35.630 --> 03:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
10 of house bill 2. I don't know what
 
03:38:38.690 --> 03:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
section it is now but the 10 and 11.
 
03:38:38.700 --> 03:38:39.849 align:start position:0%
section it is now but the 10 and 11.
um

03:38:39.849 --> 03:38:39.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:42.950 --> 03:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
everybody has sort of their favorite and
 
03:38:45.769 --> 03:38:45.779 align:start position:0%
least favorite parts of the budget and
 
03:38:48.590 --> 03:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
this is for me my least favorite part I
 
03:38:48.600 --> 03:38:49.849 align:start position:0%
this is for me my least favorite part I
think

03:38:49.849 --> 03:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:38:49.859 --> 03:38:50.570 align:start position:0%
think
um

03:38:50.570 --> 03:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:53.150 --> 03:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's just inappropriate public
 
03:38:57.349 --> 03:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
spending in my mind we get our money
 
03:39:01.309 --> 03:39:01.319 align:start position:0%
from from people all over the state many
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
of them from Modest modest means we
 
03:39:07.070 --> 03:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
charge a large amount of property tax
 
03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
and so on so so everyone comes
 
03:39:09.479 --> 03:39:10.790 align:start position:0%
and so on so so everyone comes
contributes

03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
contributes
 
03:39:13.550 --> 03:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
and in this case we are taking their
 
03:39:18.769 --> 03:39:18.779 align:start position:0%
money and using it to buy a hockey rink
 
03:39:22.990 --> 03:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
um a hockey arena and to me that's just
 
03:39:27.290 --> 03:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
completely inappropriate it's not like
 
03:39:29.929 --> 03:39:29.939 align:start position:0%
much of the other things we spend in the
 
03:39:33.530 --> 03:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
budget where people are children or
 
03:39:38.690 --> 03:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
disabled or sick or elderly and so on
 
03:39:40.729 --> 03:39:40.739 align:start position:0%
um or even core functions of government
 
03:39:44.090 --> 03:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
like like justice and prisons and all
 
03:39:49.309 --> 03:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
that these are fans and participants in
 
03:39:53.150 --> 03:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
hockey and it seems to me that this
 
03:39:54.830 --> 03:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
would this item
 
03:39:57.349 --> 03:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
must be the easiest thing for the
 
03:39:59.990 --> 03:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
University to raise money on their own
 
03:40:02.830 --> 03:40:02.840 align:start position:0%
right I mean this is be very attractive
 
03:40:06.650 --> 03:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
to fans of hockey people they could sell
 
03:40:09.190 --> 03:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
seats they can sell bricks they can
 
03:40:12.229 --> 03:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
raise money and so on so I just think
 
03:40:14.389 --> 03:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
this is a this is an inappropriate
 
03:40:14.399 --> 03:40:17.330 align:start position:0%
this is a this is an inappropriate
expenditure

03:40:17.330 --> 03:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
03:40:20.690 --> 03:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
now you might ask well okay if we save 6
 
03:40:23.150 --> 03:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
million since this is the worst part of
 
03:40:25.429 --> 03:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
the budget maybe we should add 6 million
 
03:40:27.110 --> 03:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
to some other part of the budget right
 
03:40:30.349 --> 03:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion any other part would
 
03:40:31.750 --> 03:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
be an improvement
 
03:40:35.809 --> 03:40:35.819 align:start position:0%
but in this case I have not proposed to
 
03:40:37.790 --> 03:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
add this money back into some other
 
03:40:40.729 --> 03:40:40.739 align:start position:0%
section but instead just to leave it out
 
03:40:40.739 --> 03:40:42.349 align:start position:0%
section but instead just to leave it out
and

03:40:42.349 --> 03:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:40:44.690 --> 03:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
just in general I think you know we
 
03:40:47.150 --> 03:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
don't have to spend every single last
 
03:40:50.690 --> 03:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
dollar and if we leave a little wiggle
 
03:40:53.929 --> 03:40:53.939 align:start position:0%
room for the Senate that means that the
 
03:40:56.750 --> 03:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
things that our our priorities when they
 
03:40:58.429 --> 03:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
add their priorities they would have to
 
03:41:01.070 --> 03:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
change our priorities less if you see
 
03:41:04.610 --> 03:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
what I mean so so this is just simply a
 
03:41:07.190 --> 03:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
cut not not a balance in some sense
 
03:41:09.650 --> 03:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative
 
03:41:12.349 --> 03:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
Heath for a question thank you Mr chair
 
03:41:12.359 --> 03:41:13.070 align:start position:0%
Heath for a question thank you Mr chair
um

03:41:13.070 --> 03:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
the University of New Hampshire serves
 
03:41:17.229 --> 03:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
our state well
 
03:41:19.910 --> 03:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
we have a Workforce that comes directly
 
03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
from them the Whittemore Center is not
 
03:41:24.410 --> 03:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
only a hockey rink
 
03:41:27.229 --> 03:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
um the purpose behind this is to
 
03:41:27.239 --> 03:41:28.450 align:start position:0%
um the purpose behind this is to
actually

03:41:28.450 --> 03:41:28.460 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:41:32.269 --> 03:41:32.279 align:start position:0%
offer essentially seed money that will
 
03:41:36.610 --> 03:41:36.620 align:start position:0%
be doubled and tripled by many private
 
03:41:40.670 --> 03:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
donors but those donors are looking for
 
03:41:42.950 --> 03:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
an understanding that the state of New
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire believes in the University of
 
03:41:48.469 --> 03:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire funds the University of
 
03:41:49.630 --> 03:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:41:53.929 --> 03:41:53.939 align:start position:0%
this is a small amount of money that we
 
03:41:56.809 --> 03:41:56.819 align:start position:0%
can step forward and there will be other
 
03:41:58.910 --> 03:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
donors who will step forward because we
 
03:42:01.610 --> 03:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
have stepped forward we have not funded
 
03:42:04.670 --> 03:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
this I I'd say in this biennium we are
 
03:42:07.070 --> 03:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
doing the best we probably have done in
 
03:42:10.130 --> 03:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
a long time but this is important for
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
the University and I think it's
 
03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
something that it's time that we use
 
03:42:18.590 --> 03:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
this as a step forward now the
 
03:42:20.750 --> 03:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
Whittemore Center is used for many
 
03:42:20.760 --> 03:42:21.950 align:start position:0%
Whittemore Center is used for many
purposes

03:42:21.950 --> 03:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
03:42:24.650 --> 03:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
um it's used by many high school teams
 
03:42:27.410 --> 03:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
when they play have their playoffs it's
 
03:42:31.429 --> 03:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
used as a entertainment venue and it's
 
03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
also a venue that can be used to drive
 
03:42:37.610 --> 03:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
more funds for the University of New
 
03:42:40.670 --> 03:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I would ask you all to vote
 
03:42:43.309 --> 03:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
no on this amendment and move forward so
 
03:42:45.050 --> 03:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
we can support the University of New
 
03:42:47.570 --> 03:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Whittemore Center thank you
 
03:42:50.450 --> 03:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt for a question
 
03:42:52.550 --> 03:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I didn't I didn't realize
 
03:42:56.630 --> 03:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:58.969 --> 03:42:58.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh and thank you
 
03:43:01.309 --> 03:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
um from my memory of the testimony we
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
heard from UNH when we were discussing
 
03:43:08.929 --> 03:43:08.939 align:start position:0%
their budget trimming from the 8 million
 
03:43:12.410 --> 03:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
to the 6 million presented
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and which we're now contemplating
 
03:43:16.309 --> 03:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
deleting that line item
 
03:43:18.710 --> 03:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
um the test money was stated that not
 
03:43:21.530 --> 03:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
only were the you know UNH division one
 
03:43:22.910 --> 03:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
hockey players
 
03:43:24.769 --> 03:43:24.779 align:start position:0%
um taking advantage of the ice and the
 
03:43:27.889 --> 03:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
facilities but also para Olympian and
 
03:43:31.190 --> 03:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
other disability based teams who train
 
03:43:33.710 --> 03:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
in that Center as well so I think is it
 
03:43:35.269 --> 03:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
correct that the earlier comment that
 
03:43:37.190 --> 03:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
this does not
 
03:43:39.290 --> 03:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
um help our children across the state
 
03:43:42.650 --> 03:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
who have disabilities incorrect In fact
 
03:43:42.660 --> 03:43:44.870 align:start position:0%
who have disabilities incorrect In fact
correct

03:43:44.870 --> 03:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:43:46.429 --> 03:43:46.439 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for a question
 
03:43:48.170 --> 03:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
followed by representative Murray uh
 
03:43:50.510 --> 03:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair not many people know
 
03:43:53.389 --> 03:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
that I grew up in the in Nebraska and
 
03:43:55.190 --> 03:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
they have a strong football program
 
03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
there and they spend a lot of money on
 
03:43:59.150 --> 03:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
it because it's a big part of the
 
03:43:59.160 --> 03:44:00.190 align:start position:0%
it because it's a big part of the
culture

03:44:00.190 --> 03:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
culture
 
03:44:03.950 --> 03:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
the state appropriates no money to the
 
03:44:06.530 --> 03:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
athletic department of the state it's
 
03:44:09.590 --> 03:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for supplying all of its own
 
03:44:12.170 --> 03:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
Revenue to cover all of its own costs
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
and knowing that over the last two
 
03:44:16.969 --> 03:44:16.979 align:start position:0%
decades there's been a facilities arms
 
03:44:20.030 --> 03:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
race where schools are competing each
 
03:44:22.429 --> 03:44:22.439 align:start position:0%
other with each other on the basis of
 
03:44:25.070 --> 03:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
nice facilities I can appreciate the
 
03:44:28.490 --> 03:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
whittemore's request to upgrade their
 
03:44:30.889 --> 03:44:30.899 align:start position:0%
facility I would just say that I don't
 
03:44:32.570 --> 03:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
believe that's a state responsibility
 
03:44:34.969 --> 03:44:34.979 align:start position:0%
because that's the way I grew up thank
 
03:44:34.979 --> 03:44:36.710 align:start position:0%
because that's the way I grew up thank
you

03:44:36.710 --> 03:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:44:38.690 --> 03:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
present Murray for a question thank you
 
03:44:39.950 --> 03:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
um just um seconding that this is an
 
03:44:44.570 --> 03:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
important public private Enterprise
 
03:44:46.610 --> 03:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
which I think has great benefit across
 
03:44:49.790 --> 03:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
the state and to that and uh when I've
 
03:44:52.309 --> 03:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
been there it's not filled with students
 
03:44:54.469 --> 03:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
it's filled with families who aren't
 
03:44:55.790 --> 03:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
really associated with the university
 
03:44:58.429 --> 03:44:58.439 align:start position:0%
and it's a fairly expensive in night or
 
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
night out for everyone to be able to go
 
03:45:03.889 --> 03:45:03.899 align:start position:0%
there so it's used well well beyond your
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
sense of oh this is a university
 
03:45:07.190 --> 03:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
Enterprise a bunch of University
 
03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
students there I was really taken aback
 
03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
of the number of families who are there
 
03:45:12.849 --> 03:45:12.859 align:start position:0%
for a pleasant night out
 
03:45:15.710 --> 03:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
and it is a revenue stream that can be
 
03:45:17.030 --> 03:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
an additional Revenue stream the
 
03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
Republican convention was held there one
 
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
year it was filled there are lots of
 
03:45:23.450 --> 03:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
opportunities we talked about the new
 
03:45:23.460 --> 03:45:24.050 align:start position:0%
opportunities we talked about the new
um

03:45:24.050 --> 03:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:26.330 --> 03:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
concept which is really new to me of
 
03:45:28.070 --> 03:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
e-gaming and having all these sort of
 
03:45:30.349 --> 03:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
competitions it's not just that they're
 
03:45:32.690 --> 03:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
building this place but that it enhances
 
03:45:34.910 --> 03:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
a revenue stream that brings in more
 
03:45:36.170 --> 03:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
money to the University of New Hampshire
 
03:45:39.889 --> 03:45:39.899 align:start position:0%
and also I think I recall in um the
 
03:45:41.990 --> 03:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that the students at the
 
03:45:43.790 --> 03:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire 50 coming
 
03:45:46.450 --> 03:45:46.460 align:start position:0%
from other places and 50 staying here
 
03:45:49.130 --> 03:45:49.140 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire intend to stay here
 
03:45:52.010 --> 03:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
so the University is also providing a
 
03:45:53.870 --> 03:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
venue for Workforce where these students
 
03:45:55.190 --> 03:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
come here and they decide they're going
 
03:45:57.110 --> 03:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to stay in New
 
03:45:58.969 --> 03:45:58.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and having
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
I hesitate a little bit to use the word
 
03:46:02.929 --> 03:46:02.939 align:start position:0%
amenity because it goes way beyond that
 
03:46:04.610 --> 03:46:04.620 align:start position:0%
but having a university that is
 
03:46:06.950 --> 03:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
competing at a national International
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
level is bringing in fabulous students
 
03:46:11.090 --> 03:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
that we want that we want to stay here
 
03:46:13.190 --> 03:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
so I think that this is an investment
 
03:46:15.710 --> 03:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
not necessarily in the University of New
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire although it is it's an
 
03:46:20.269 --> 03:46:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:20.279 --> 03:46:22.429 align:start position:0%
 
president

03:46:22.429 --> 03:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
president
 
03:46:24.710 --> 03:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and it's a comment
 
03:46:24.720 --> 03:46:26.330 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and it's a comment
really

03:46:26.330 --> 03:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:46:28.910 --> 03:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
um having been the other State Rep that
 
03:46:31.130 --> 03:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
visited I do agree with representative
 
03:46:34.750 --> 03:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
Murray that the upgrades to the
 
03:46:36.650 --> 03:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
infrastructure are needed they don't
 
03:46:38.570 --> 03:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
actually affect the rink itself the rink
 
03:46:40.790 --> 03:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
is fine the way it is but the weight
 
03:46:42.590 --> 03:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
rooms and there are a lot of things
 
03:46:44.690 --> 03:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
underneath where
 
03:46:47.570 --> 03:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
the athletes that compete have less than
 
03:46:50.090 --> 03:46:50.100 align:start position:0%
ideal facilities which indeed affects
 
03:46:52.610 --> 03:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
recruiting so I absolutely see the need
 
03:46:56.510 --> 03:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
for UNH to upgrade those facilities but
 
03:46:58.610 --> 03:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
having been one of the few people who
 
03:47:02.330 --> 03:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
voted against this in my division
 
03:47:04.790 --> 03:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's not that I don't see the need it's
 
03:47:07.429 --> 03:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
that I don't think that the need is
 
03:47:09.830 --> 03:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
compelling enough for the state to spend
 
03:47:11.570 --> 03:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
money that are kind of desperately
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
needed elsewhere and our unfunded
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
liabilities come to mind that
 
03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
you know we we have to do this but I
 
03:47:21.530 --> 03:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
want to make it very clear that I fully
 
03:47:24.469 --> 03:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
agree that in order for the sports
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
program to stay competitive they do need
 
03:47:27.950 --> 03:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
to improve
 
03:47:30.349 --> 03:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
it's just you know
 
03:47:33.050 --> 03:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
not something that I'm comfortable
 
03:47:35.870 --> 03:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
sending General funds you know funds too
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:47:40.790 --> 03:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney thank you Mr
 
03:47:42.229 --> 03:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
chairman this is this is more of a
 
03:47:43.790 --> 03:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
comment I want to thank the vice chair
 
03:47:45.410 --> 03:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
of my division representative McGuire
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
for bringing this amendment forward uh I
 
03:47:50.450 --> 03:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
will be voting no on the amendment
 
03:47:51.830 --> 03:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
though and I think in this committee
 
03:47:54.229 --> 03:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
when we're voting no on a financial
 
03:47:56.630 --> 03:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
proposal whether from a division or as
 
03:47:59.750 --> 03:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment we should explain why we're
 
03:48:01.130 --> 03:48:01.140 align:start position:0%
voting now so that's what I'm going to
 
03:48:02.990 --> 03:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
attempt to do here
 
03:48:05.330 --> 03:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
this budget is going to have a lot of
 
03:48:08.030 --> 03:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
pills in it that we all have to swallow
 
03:48:10.490 --> 03:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
I I mentioned in division when one when
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
we were working on our elements of the
 
03:48:14.450 --> 03:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
budget I think if each of us put
 
03:48:16.250 --> 03:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
together a budget that we would want
 
03:48:18.710 --> 03:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
individually there'd be 400 budgets in
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that we'd be
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
considering I respect and I thank the
 
03:48:25.910 --> 03:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
work of division two that looked at this
 
03:48:27.950 --> 03:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
part of the budget they worked among
 
03:48:29.870 --> 03:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
themselves in good faith on what they
 
03:48:31.610 --> 03:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
presented to us today and I support the
 
03:48:33.710 --> 03:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
work that they put forward in
 
03:48:35.990 --> 03:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
um and I look at this we can we can
 
03:48:38.690 --> 03:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
debate the philosophy on whether State
 
03:48:40.670 --> 03:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
funds should be used on this should not
 
03:48:42.830 --> 03:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
be used on this but I think it's a piece
 
03:48:44.450 --> 03:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
of the budget package
 
03:48:46.610 --> 03:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
that is going to make it easier for
 
03:48:49.070 --> 03:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
others to swallow different pills in the
 
03:48:51.530 --> 03:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
budget they may not want to swallow it's
 
03:48:53.030 --> 03:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
not going to be a budget that I think we
 
03:48:54.290 --> 03:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
can all
 
03:48:57.769 --> 03:48:57.779 align:start position:0%
uh swallow each individual pill but as a
 
03:48:59.750 --> 03:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
Morpheus it's something that we can all
 
03:49:03.050 --> 03:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
get behind and if this is something that
 
03:49:04.910 --> 03:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
is going to help others support the
 
03:49:07.610 --> 03:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
overall final package I'll vote to keep
 
03:49:09.830 --> 03:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
this in the budget by voting against
 
03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment but I do hope we're all
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
operating in good faith in that we can
 
03:49:16.309 --> 03:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
get to a budget proposal either by the
 
03:49:17.929 --> 03:49:17.939 align:start position:0%
end of tomorrow or by the end of
 
03:49:20.929 --> 03:49:20.939 align:start position:0%
Wednesday that we can unite behind as a
 
03:49:22.010 --> 03:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
committee because I do think that's
 
03:49:23.389 --> 03:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
important for the people of New
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from what I've heard from the
 
03:49:26.929 --> 03:49:26.939 align:start position:0%
other divisions and I know we had a
 
03:49:28.849 --> 03:49:28.859 align:start position:0%
great time on division one putting
 
03:49:30.830 --> 03:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
together our proposal and and we heard a
 
03:49:32.570 --> 03:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
presentation from division two and I'm
 
03:49:35.030 --> 03:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
eager to hear division three a lot of
 
03:49:36.469 --> 03:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
work was put into it I don't want to
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
second guess the work the divisions have
 
03:49:41.450 --> 03:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
put in and I do want to make sure that
 
03:49:44.809 --> 03:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
we can build a budget together that
 
03:49:46.490 --> 03:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
works for all the different pockets of
 
03:49:49.070 --> 03:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I appreciate the
 
03:49:51.170 --> 03:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
conversation the you know and I probably
 
03:49:52.729 --> 03:49:52.739 align:start position:0%
in a
 
03:49:55.429 --> 03:49:55.439 align:start position:0%
separate matter would say you know
 
03:49:57.950 --> 03:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
no to the Whittemore Center I think it's
 
03:49:59.929 --> 03:49:59.939 align:start position:0%
an impece important piece to get this
 
03:50:01.370 --> 03:50:01.380 align:start position:0%
overall budget passed and that's why
 
03:50:03.769 --> 03:50:03.779 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting no uh hoping that we're
 
03:50:05.870 --> 03:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
all engaging in good faith to to get a
 
03:50:08.090 --> 03:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
budget finalized that we can all support
 
03:50:12.469 --> 03:50:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:13.910 --> 03:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
03:50:16.790 --> 03:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
I just want to make a a point this is
 
03:50:21.050 --> 03:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
actually coming out of surplus funds I
 
03:50:22.429 --> 03:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
mean there's still there's still State
 
03:50:26.510 --> 03:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
funds but it is Surplus and it is a a
 
03:50:29.090 --> 03:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
coordinated effort at the University
 
03:50:30.830 --> 03:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
because the funds that are coming in are
 
03:50:34.070 --> 03:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
from donors sponsors UNH itself and the
 
03:50:37.130 --> 03:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
state and Par I I got a call from an
 
03:50:40.990 --> 03:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
alumni from 73 encouraging me to support
 
03:50:44.210 --> 03:50:44.220 align:start position:0%
say we really need to know the state is
 
03:50:46.190 --> 03:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
behind the University
 
03:50:46.200 --> 03:50:47.330 align:start position:0%
behind the University
so

03:50:47.330 --> 03:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
I'll be voting no on the amendment
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for a question uh
 
03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and this is a
 
03:50:57.410 --> 03:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
question to the amendment sponsor
 
03:51:00.229 --> 03:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
um so I understand it there are a lot of
 
03:51:03.889 --> 03:51:03.899 align:start position:0%
tensions at the end of uh our stay at
 
03:51:05.870 --> 03:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
the Whittemore Center as a legislature
 
03:51:08.630 --> 03:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
and that there were rumors that we had
 
03:51:11.229 --> 03:51:11.239 align:start position:0%
been kicked out and asked not to return
 
03:51:13.849 --> 03:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
and so would you consider an amendment
 
03:51:15.830 --> 03:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
that would designate the Whittemore
 
03:51:18.710 --> 03:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
Center if we put money into it as the
 
03:51:21.590 --> 03:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
secondary off-site location for the

I'd like to introduce the first one is
 
03:55:36.290 --> 03:55:36.300 align:start position:0%
um an appropriation it's uh amendment
 
03:55:39.889 --> 03:55:39.899 align:start position:0%
number 1202h it's appropriation to the
 
03:55:41.929 --> 03:55:41.939 align:start position:0%
Department of Education adult education
 
03:55:45.290 --> 03:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
the sum of five hundred thousand dollars
 
03:55:47.689 --> 03:55:47.699 align:start position:0%
um in the fiscal year ending June 30th
 
03:55:50.630 --> 03:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh 2023
 
03:55:52.189 --> 03:55:52.199 align:start position:0%
um is hereby appropriated to the
 
03:55:53.870 --> 03:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for the purpose
 
03:55:56.150 --> 03:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
of increasing funding available for
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
Grants to adult education programs
 
03:56:00.410 --> 03:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
during the biennium ending June 30th
 
03:56:03.530 --> 03:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
2025. this appropriation shall not lapse
 
03:56:05.090 --> 03:56:05.100 align:start position:0%
the governor's
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
um so the purpose of this amendment is a
 
03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
simple one
 
03:56:11.929 --> 03:56:11.939 align:start position:0%
um it's come to my attention that um
 
03:56:17.450 --> 03:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
due to a regional formula change a
 
03:56:19.969 --> 03:56:19.979 align:start position:0%
number of dis school districts adult
 
03:56:22.910 --> 03:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
education programs have had their
 
03:56:25.849 --> 03:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
funding reduced uh for example example
 
03:56:29.809 --> 03:56:29.819 align:start position:0%
Dover Nashua and some other districts as
 
03:56:32.929 --> 03:56:32.939 align:start position:0%
well and this appropriation of five
 
03:56:34.550 --> 03:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars to the adult
 
03:56:37.969 --> 03:56:37.979 align:start position:0%
education line would help to at least
 
03:56:41.750 --> 03:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
mitigate to some degree that change in
 
03:56:45.290 --> 03:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
funding so I'd appreciate a yes vote on
 
03:56:48.170 --> 03:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
this amendment thank you Mr chair
 
03:56:50.750 --> 03:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
how much is already in that line
 
03:56:52.849 --> 03:56:52.859 align:start position:0%
um I think it's about 4.3 million each
 
03:56:52.859 --> 03:56:53.870 align:start position:0%
um I think it's about 4.3 million each
year

03:56:53.870 --> 03:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:56:57.229 --> 03:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
a 4.5 million Mickey
 
03:56:58.490 --> 03:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
at the eight
 
03:57:00.349 --> 03:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
I'd have to look that up
 
03:57:03.710 --> 03:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
it's in approximately 4.5
 
03:57:06.590 --> 03:57:06.600 align:start position:0%
and our adult education programs across
 
03:57:09.349 --> 03:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
our state have done yeoman's work
 
03:57:11.389 --> 03:57:11.399 align:start position:0%
um so many of our our youth who become
 
03:57:13.130 --> 03:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
different disenfranchised with school
 
03:57:16.070 --> 03:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
have gone on adults coming to this
 
03:57:17.990 --> 03:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
country from other

03:57:26.269 --> 03:57:26.279 align:start position:0%
course through adult education so it
 
03:57:29.030 --> 03:57:29.040 align:start position:0%

the director of the Nashua Adult

Learning Center reached out to me when
 
03:58:25.070 --> 03:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
they discovered this
 
03:58:27.170 --> 03:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
oversight and how the funding formula
 
03:58:27.180 --> 03:58:28.490 align:start position:0%
oversight and how the funding formula
had

03:58:28.490 --> 03:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:58:30.889 --> 03:58:30.899 align:start position:0%
drastically impacted what they were
 
03:58:32.349 --> 03:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
planning on receiving
 
03:58:35.330 --> 03:58:35.340 align:start position:0%
the amount of services that they provide
 
03:58:37.969 --> 03:58:37.979 align:start position:0%
has really skyrocketed in the last few
 
03:58:41.510 --> 03:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
years and this will be a small
 
03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
correction to try to help them stay on
 
03:58:47.330 --> 03:58:47.340 align:start position:0%

so parents can continue with their
 
03:59:04.550 --> 03:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
education and I hope everyone could
 
03:59:06.710 --> 03:59:06.720 align:start position:0%

if I may miss cheer
 
03:59:31.199 --> 03:59:31.849 align:start position:0%
if I may miss cheer
um

03:59:31.849 --> 03:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:34.010 --> 03:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:59:37.370 --> 03:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
um I did not know about this
 
03:59:39.889 --> 03:59:39.899 align:start position:0%
um issue in the beginning when I asked
 
03:59:41.990 --> 03:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of Education
 
03:59:44.210 --> 03:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
um he explained that um he thought that
 
03:59:47.570 --> 03:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
there were sufficient funds in that line
 
03:59:49.969 --> 03:59:49.979 align:start position:0%
um because I had wanted to increase that
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
line and he said we really didn't need
 
03:59:54.830 --> 03:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
to and then I became because of the
 
03:59:57.530 --> 03:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
change in the formula and the concerns
 
03:59:59.510 --> 03:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
that have been raised by various
 
03:59:59.520 --> 04:00:01.670 align:start position:0%
that have been raised by various
entities

04:00:01.670 --> 04:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
entities
 
04:00:04.550 --> 04:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
um it came to my attention and I did go
 
04:00:07.070 --> 04:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
and speak with the chair of division two
 
04:00:10.070 --> 04:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
and at that time that was the day that
 
04:00:14.030 --> 04:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
we made our major move in terms of our
 
04:00:17.269 --> 04:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
funding thank you to chair Wyler
 
04:00:19.910 --> 04:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
um so I did not get a chance to really
 
04:00:23.030 --> 04:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
bring it up and do anything so I asked
 
04:00:24.469 --> 04:00:24.479 align:start position:0%
the chair if he would be comfortable
 
04:00:26.990 --> 04:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
with me doing this today and he said it
 
04:00:29.590 --> 04:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:31.969 --> 04:00:31.979 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up
 
04:00:34.309 --> 04:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
um did you have the opportunity to reach
 
04:00:36.349 --> 04:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
out to the you know commissioner or the
 
04:00:38.510 --> 04:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education tour was it just
 
04:00:40.370 --> 04:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
you know us and the people you already
 
04:00:40.380 --> 04:00:41.929 align:start position:0%
you know us and the people you already
mentioned

04:00:41.929 --> 04:00:41.939 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
04:00:44.870 --> 04:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh yes um as a matter of fact on on
 
04:00:47.389 --> 04:00:47.399 align:start position:0%
Friday during fiscal the Department of
 
04:00:49.969 --> 04:00:49.979 align:start position:0%
Education was here and I asked the
 
04:00:52.130 --> 04:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
representative to go back to the
 
04:00:53.510 --> 04:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
department she couldn't answer the
 
04:00:55.370 --> 04:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
question so she went back to the
 
04:00:58.550 --> 04:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and she inquired
 
04:01:00.530 --> 04:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
and she came back and explained to me
 
04:01:02.090 --> 04:01:02.100 align:start position:0%
that there had been a change in the
 
04:01:04.910 --> 04:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
formula that's why those communities
 
04:01:08.090 --> 04:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
received a lower allocation
 
04:01:09.769 --> 04:01:09.779 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:01:12.650 --> 04:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh yes sir thank
 
04:01:15.050 --> 04:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
you for the second comment I I just I
 
04:01:17.929 --> 04:01:17.939 align:start position:0%
would want to point out that in the
 
04:01:19.910 --> 04:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
division III budget there's a section
 
04:01:24.910 --> 04:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
for refugees in which we do pay for
 
04:01:27.590 --> 04:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
Education such as English as a second
 
04:01:30.050 --> 04:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
language and if we were to spend this
 
04:01:32.389 --> 04:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
money it might be better to spend it
 
04:01:34.790 --> 04:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
over through DHHS where there might be
 
04:01:37.309 --> 04:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
some matching money available
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
um and uh I'm I'm gonna vote no on this
 
04:01:43.790 --> 04:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
because I'd rather see this money go in
 
04:01:45.349 --> 04:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
to increase the amount that we're going
 
04:01:47.450 --> 04:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
to put into the Medicaid uh
 
04:01:50.330 --> 04:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate increase
 
04:01:53.630 --> 04:01:53.640 align:start position:0%

chair
 
04:01:59.630 --> 04:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
I'm very curious about the this formula
 
04:02:01.969 --> 04:02:01.979 align:start position:0%
do you mean the formula that determines
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
how much each School District gets or
 
04:02:05.279 --> 04:02:07.189 align:start position:0%
how much each School District gets or
what

04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:02:10.130 --> 04:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
you know the department told me it's a
 
04:02:14.210 --> 04:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
regional shift in the formula
 
04:02:15.410 --> 04:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
um that
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
um gives out the I believe the federal
 
04:02:18.479 --> 04:02:19.670 align:start position:0%
um gives out the I believe the federal
dollars

04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:02:22.010 --> 04:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
so follow-up
 
04:02:25.849 --> 04:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
so is this who owns this formula and why
 
04:02:28.910 --> 04:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:31.849 --> 04:02:31.859 align:start position:0%
I was only told that it was changed by
 
04:02:34.910 --> 04:02:34.920 align:start position:0%

representative Murray's recognized

04:06:10.250 --> 04:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
Mooney
 
04:06:11.929 --> 04:06:11.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you members
 
04:06:14.150 --> 04:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
of the committee I appreciate uh you
 
04:06:17.630 --> 04:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
indulging me here amendment number 1175
 
04:06:20.570 --> 04:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
H is an exact replica of a bill I
 
04:06:23.990 --> 04:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
sponsored this term House Bill 354 which
 
04:06:26.030 --> 04:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
is currently retained in the House
 
04:06:28.790 --> 04:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
Education committee I apologize that it
 
04:06:31.729 --> 04:06:31.739 align:start position:0%
looks onerous but this is simply what
 
04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment does
 
04:06:37.729 --> 04:06:37.739 align:start position:0%
public charter schools are not allowed
 
04:06:41.450 --> 04:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
or permitted to Simply apply
 
04:06:43.910 --> 04:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
for school building Aid
 
04:06:47.750 --> 04:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
this does nothing more than allow public
 
04:06:49.490 --> 04:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
charter schools of which there are
 
04:06:52.910 --> 04:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
approximately 28 in the state
 
04:06:55.490 --> 04:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
to Simply go through the process like
 
04:06:59.150 --> 04:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
any other public school to apply and
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
then have the district vote on The
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
Ultimate Building Aid through a warrant
 
04:07:07.370 --> 04:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
article it's an onerous process
 
04:07:09.349 --> 04:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
you may recall when the Department of
 
04:07:11.950 --> 04:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
Education came to testify in front of us
 
04:07:15.229 --> 04:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
about some school building Aid items I
 
04:07:17.870 --> 04:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
asked the question are public charter
 
04:07:20.870 --> 04:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
schools the only Public Schools excluded
 
04:07:24.590 --> 04:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
from the ability to apply for school
 
04:07:28.790 --> 04:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
building Aid and the answer was yes
 
04:07:31.849 --> 04:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
so this bill keeps the school building
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
aid process intact it just simply allows
 
04:07:39.290 --> 04:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
those public charter schools that own
 
04:07:41.269 --> 04:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
their own buildings
 
04:07:43.729 --> 04:07:43.739 align:start position:0%
so now you're up to about two or three
 
04:07:46.189 --> 04:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
in this state only those that own their
 
04:07:48.950 --> 04:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
own buildings would be allowed to apply
 
04:07:50.929 --> 04:07:50.939 align:start position:0%
and go through the process like any
 
04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
other Public School in our state
 
04:07:56.330 --> 04:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
there is no fiscal impact here
 
04:08:01.429 --> 04:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
my house bill 354 has no fiscal note
 
04:08:03.889 --> 04:08:03.899 align:start position:0%
another thing this amendment does
 
04:08:08.290 --> 04:08:08.300 align:start position:0%
is it corrects currently a glaring
 
04:08:11.570 --> 04:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
contradiction in our law
 
04:08:13.729 --> 04:08:13.739 align:start position:0%
so glaring in fact that when we had the
 
04:08:15.590 --> 04:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
department of Ed in front of us to talk
 
04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
about appropriating money for a position
 
04:08:20.689 --> 04:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
so that someone could go through all the
 
04:08:23.290 --> 04:08:23.300 align:start position:0%
education statutes and re-codify them
 
04:08:28.729 --> 04:08:28.739 align:start position:0%
they used this example as the reason for
 
04:08:30.530 --> 04:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
the position
 
04:08:33.889 --> 04:08:33.899 align:start position:0%
this amendment would take out the
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
section in current law that says no
 
04:08:39.110 --> 04:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools May apply for school
 
04:08:40.490 --> 04:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
building Aid
 
04:08:43.070 --> 04:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
but it keeps the section in law that
 
04:08:45.650 --> 04:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
says they may get up to 30 percent of
 
04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
the project if they go through the
 
04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
process appropriately and are awarded
 
04:08:52.010 --> 04:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
School building Aid
 
04:08:54.290 --> 04:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
we cannot let a glaring defect like that
 
04:08:56.809 --> 04:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
in our law continue in fact to the point
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
that the department of Ed has had many
 
04:09:01.729 --> 04:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
questions and it caused confusion
 
04:09:04.729 --> 04:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
so with that description I would
 
04:09:07.250 --> 04:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that this committee add
 
04:09:10.849 --> 04:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
this amendment to House Bill 2 in order
 
04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
to put public charter schools one step
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
forward to be on the same footing as
 
04:09:18.650 --> 04:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
traditional schools and correct the
 
04:09:20.929 --> 04:09:20.939 align:start position:0%
glare in the current statute thank you
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative leishmanford
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:09:29.689 --> 04:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question could you
 
04:09:31.729 --> 04:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
tell us why the education committee
 
04:09:34.849 --> 04:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
tabled it and didn't move it along
 
04:09:37.610 --> 04:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
I could give an answer
 
04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
um not speaking on behalf of the House
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
Education committee
 
04:09:45.170 --> 04:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
however two things come to mind
 
04:09:47.809 --> 04:09:47.819 align:start position:0%
first of all they've retained a host of
 
04:09:50.870 --> 04:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
rather sophisticated School building Aid
 
04:09:50.880 --> 04:09:52.189 align:start position:0%
rather sophisticated School building Aid
bills

04:09:52.189 --> 04:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:09:54.530 --> 04:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
some of which to change the formula
 
04:09:56.689 --> 04:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
change the process change the timeline
 
04:09:59.510 --> 04:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
change the deadline and so naturally it
 
04:10:01.849 --> 04:10:01.859 align:start position:0%
would make sense to retain this as well
 
04:10:05.929 --> 04:10:05.939 align:start position:0%
and include it as part of that bundle
 
04:10:08.809 --> 04:10:08.819 align:start position:0%
also in my introduction of House Bill
 
04:10:11.210 --> 04:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
354 to the house education committee
 
04:10:13.490 --> 04:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
there was talk about well who owns the
 
04:10:16.189 --> 04:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
building if it were to dissolve what
 
04:10:18.370 --> 04:10:18.380 align:start position:0%
happens in that case
 
04:10:22.910 --> 04:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
my bill my Amendment addresses that and
 
04:10:24.950 --> 04:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
also the Department of Education has
 
04:10:26.929 --> 04:10:26.939 align:start position:0%
Provisions about who owns the building
 
04:10:30.469 --> 04:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
in each Charter if a school were to
 
04:10:30.479 --> 04:10:31.729 align:start position:0%
in each Charter if a school were to
close

04:10:31.729 --> 04:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
close
 
04:10:34.070 --> 04:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
but that's my opinion as to why it was
 
04:10:36.469 --> 04:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
retained of those two issues I've
 
04:10:39.349 --> 04:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
discussed this with Amy Clark my
 
04:10:40.910 --> 04:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
original bill at the department of Ed
 
04:10:43.729 --> 04:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
she oversees School building Aid so she
 
04:10:47.630 --> 04:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:49.849 --> 04:10:49.859 align:start position:0%
um that is my my thought with regards to
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:55.790 --> 04:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
but I would if I could just remind uh
 
04:11:00.229 --> 04:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
members that of 28 schools charter
 
04:11:02.570 --> 04:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
schools in the state approximately only
 
04:11:05.150 --> 04:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
two or three own their building and this
 
04:11:08.210 --> 04:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
amendment applies only to charter
 
04:11:09.950 --> 04:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
schools that own their own buildings
 
04:11:11.630 --> 04:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:17.389 --> 04:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:18.830 --> 04:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
04:11:18.840 --> 04:11:21.530 align:start position:0%
tell me
how

04:11:21.530 --> 04:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:11:25.070 --> 04:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
how a school a charter school that owned
 
04:11:27.229 --> 04:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
its own building what would happen if
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
they did
 
04:11:28.800 --> 04:11:29.570 align:start position:0%
they did
um

04:11:29.570 --> 04:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:32.870 --> 04:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
they dissolved the school dissolved how
 
04:11:35.570 --> 04:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
would you how would you handle
 
04:11:37.790 --> 04:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
building Aid that had been given to that
 
04:11:37.800 --> 04:11:40.910 align:start position:0%
building Aid that had been given to that
school

04:11:40.910 --> 04:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:41.870 --> 04:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
04:11:45.950 --> 04:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative I would direct you to the
 
04:11:52.370 --> 04:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh with regards to
 
04:11:58.490 --> 04:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
its dissolution being subject to a plan
 
04:12:00.710 --> 04:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
for the disposition of the Charter
 
04:12:02.689 --> 04:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
School's assets
 
04:12:05.689 --> 04:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
and then it quotes an RSA as approved by
 
04:12:07.610 --> 04:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
so that clause
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
was designed to specifically address
 
04:12:15.229 --> 04:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
exactly your question
 
04:12:17.570 --> 04:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
two years ago I put forward a similar
 
04:12:17.580 --> 04:12:18.710 align:start position:0%
two years ago I put forward a similar
bill

04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:12:21.290 --> 04:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
and this was this Clause was not
 
04:12:23.870 --> 04:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
included and so as a result of
 
04:12:25.610 --> 04:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
conversations I've had and to address
 
04:12:28.250 --> 04:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
the very question you ask I've inserted
 
04:12:33.110 --> 04:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:35.090 --> 04:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments from
 
04:12:36.889 --> 04:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
the committee members representative
 
04:12:36.899 --> 04:12:40.670 align:start position:0%
the committee members representative
Edward

04:12:40.670 --> 04:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:42.830 --> 04:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:12:45.349 --> 04:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
you and I haven't talked about this in a
 
04:12:47.330 --> 04:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
long time so you're going to give me an
 
04:12:49.189 --> 04:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
education I think if if you can remember
 
04:12:51.950 --> 04:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
the conversation I I had pointed out
 
04:12:54.349 --> 04:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
that I understood the Pinkerton Academy
 
04:12:57.650 --> 04:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
to be in a third category not a public
 
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
school not a chartered school but some
 
04:13:04.670 --> 04:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
other category and I had asked if this
 
04:13:06.170 --> 04:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
could be written in a way in which the
 
04:13:08.269 --> 04:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton Academy could also become
 
04:13:10.250 --> 04:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
eligible for school building Aid because
 
04:13:13.070 --> 04:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
they are not now and they serve the kids
 
04:13:16.070 --> 04:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
of uh three of my towns Chester Auburn
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
and Candia and so I I'd like to know if
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
my residents might be able to benefit
 
04:13:35.650 --> 04:13:35.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:37.969 --> 04:13:37.979 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the question I do
 
04:13:40.610 --> 04:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
recall the conversation I further recall
 
04:13:41.990 --> 04:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
that when we had somebody from the
 
04:13:43.550 --> 04:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education in front of us
 
04:13:46.370 --> 04:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
you asked that very question and a
 
04:13:48.410 --> 04:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
follow-up was promised I don't know if
 
04:13:50.570 --> 04:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
it was given to you
 
04:13:53.150 --> 04:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
I am unsure
 
04:13:55.969 --> 04:13:55.979 align:start position:0%
that that is a separate any the
 
04:13:58.670 --> 04:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton Academy is a separate category
 
04:14:00.650 --> 04:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
from a traditional public school or a
 
04:14:02.030 --> 04:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
charter school my understanding was
 
04:14:04.010 --> 04:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton Academy as a traditional
 
04:14:06.290 --> 04:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
public school that just draws from
 
04:14:08.510 --> 04:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
multiple communities as my
 
04:14:11.870 --> 04:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
impression my recollection is Cole Brown
 
04:14:14.809 --> 04:14:14.819 align:start position:0%
and Pinkerton our public academies it's
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
the way they're listed in as you say in
 
04:14:18.889 --> 04:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
the third category the neither charter
 
04:14:21.950 --> 04:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
school or public school they're um they
 
04:14:25.490 --> 04:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
get the tuition money that each student
 
04:14:28.070 --> 04:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
brings with them
 
04:14:30.530 --> 04:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
and they don't they don't uh
 
04:14:32.450 --> 04:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
request any building Aid and I think
 
04:14:39.229 --> 04:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:41.090 --> 04:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments from
 
04:14:43.429 --> 04:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
committee members representative Heath
 
04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just in relation to
 
04:14:48.250 --> 04:14:48.260 align:start position:0%
um Cole Brown and and Pinkerton Academy
 
04:14:51.170 --> 04:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
they are um
 
04:14:54.590 --> 04:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
public private they have a Board of
 
04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
Trustees they collect tuition from
 
04:15:00.290 --> 04:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
whatever just sending districts go to
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
their school
 
04:15:06.830 --> 04:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton Academy was eligible for CTE
 
04:15:06.840 --> 04:15:08.809 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton Academy was eligible for CTE
grants

04:15:08.809 --> 04:15:08.819 align:start position:0%
grants
 
04:15:11.389 --> 04:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
a Career and Technical education their
 
04:15:13.729 --> 04:15:13.739 align:start position:0%
Vocational Center and so they were in
 
04:15:16.130 --> 04:15:16.140 align:start position:0%
fact eligible for that they are not
 
04:15:18.050 --> 04:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
eligible for many of the federal
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
programs but they are a unique category
 
04:15:22.429 --> 04:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
and they are not considered a charter
 
04:15:22.439 --> 04:15:25.429 align:start position:0%
and they are not considered a charter

representative Emrick is recognized to

introduce Amendment 1185 to hb2 thank
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman in our last session we
 
04:18:01.130 --> 04:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
approved house bill 572.
 
04:18:04.490 --> 04:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
in that bill we basically made available
 
04:18:06.969 --> 04:18:06.979 align:start position:0%
a meal during school day
 
04:18:11.510 --> 04:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
with qualifications 300 percent three
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
times uh poverty level
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
however the bill had no ceiling it was
 
04:18:20.330 --> 04:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
an unlimited warrant to charge the
 
04:18:22.429 --> 04:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
04:18:25.370 --> 04:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
what this what this amendment does is it
 
04:18:26.990 --> 04:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
puts a ceiling on how much the
 
04:18:28.790 --> 04:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education can pay out
 
04:18:30.889 --> 04:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
basically saying they can't pay out any
 
04:18:33.290 --> 04:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
more than they have budgeted
 
04:18:36.170 --> 04:18:36.180 align:start position:0%
so this was basically to correct what we
 
04:18:38.030 --> 04:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
might refer to as an oops
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh very technical term
 
04:18:40.080 --> 04:18:41.330 align:start position:0%
uh very technical term
uh

04:18:41.330 --> 04:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
and that's what it does it doesn't
 
04:18:43.560 --> 04:18:44.750 align:start position:0%
and that's what it does it doesn't
change

04:18:44.750 --> 04:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:18:47.450 --> 04:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
anything to do with 572 except putting a
 
04:18:50.150 --> 04:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
lid on the spending
 
04:18:52.910 --> 04:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
this bill should have come to us
 
04:18:54.950 --> 04:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
in the regular course of events the
 
04:18:56.809 --> 04:18:56.819 align:start position:0%
chairman of Education said he was so
 
04:18:59.210 --> 04:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
swamped in bills he didn't get to all of
 
04:19:01.189 --> 04:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
them in time he had I think over 100
 
04:19:05.150 --> 04:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
bills so this one was an oversight we
 
04:19:06.110 --> 04:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
have not
 
04:19:09.229 --> 04:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
put it in the in the any of the um
 
04:19:13.250 --> 04:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
any parts of the budget so this is a way
 
04:19:16.429 --> 04:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
to find out if Senate has more money
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
when it gets to them and they want to
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
spend it this this will be there but
 
04:19:22.010 --> 04:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
it'll be at this point unfunded pretty
 
04:19:27.469 --> 04:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
much but I would move uh Amendment 1185h
 
04:19:27.479 --> 04:19:29.870 align:start position:0%
much but I would move uh Amendment 1185h
second

04:19:29.870 --> 04:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:19:31.790 --> 04:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie did you second yes
 
04:19:31.800 --> 04:19:32.929 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie did you second yes
okay

04:19:32.929 --> 04:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
further discussions on this this
 
04:19:37.910 --> 04:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips thank you
 
04:19:42.590 --> 04:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:45.769 --> 04:19:45.779 align:start position:0%
know that under HP to division two has
 
04:19:48.050 --> 04:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
expanded the eligibility of the
 
04:19:51.110 --> 04:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts for uh
 
04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
specifically I'm looking at page 13 of
 
04:19:57.530 --> 04:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.540 --> 04:19:58.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:19:58.370 --> 04:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:02.469 --> 04:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
where students who are who qualify for
 
04:20:05.510 --> 04:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
free or reduced priced meals are now
 
04:20:05.520 --> 04:20:06.889 align:start position:0%
free or reduced priced meals are now
also

04:20:06.889 --> 04:20:06.899 align:start position:0%
also
 
04:20:09.229 --> 04:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
they also that eligibility has expanded
 
04:20:10.910 --> 04:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
the EFA program so I'm wondering how
 
04:20:13.849 --> 04:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
these two bills will interact if if my
 
04:20:15.410 --> 04:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
understanding of the expanded
 
04:20:17.330 --> 04:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the efas was for a much
 
04:20:19.070 --> 04:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
higher poverty level but here we're
 
04:20:19.080 --> 04:20:19.910 align:start position:0%
higher poverty level but here we're
seeing

04:20:19.910 --> 04:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
04:20:22.429 --> 04:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
the 300 I'm just wondering if you've
 
04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:28.130 --> 04:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
interaction I'm just trying to set a a
 
04:20:31.250 --> 04:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
limit on how high I can go the Senate
 
04:20:34.490 --> 04:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
can address a lot of the details I this
 
04:20:36.830 --> 04:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
this was a let's stop the bleeding
 
04:20:38.269 --> 04:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
before it starts
 
04:20:40.969 --> 04:20:40.979 align:start position:0%
attempt so it probably needs some more
 
04:20:40.979 --> 04:20:42.469 align:start position:0%
attempt so it probably needs some more
work

04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:20:44.510 --> 04:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't even have a fiscal note
 
04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
because these these
 
04:20:50.210 --> 04:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
amounts were unknown so before we could
 
04:20:52.189 --> 04:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
anybody could place this in a budget
 
04:20:53.929 --> 04:20:53.939 align:start position:0%
we'd have to know what what's the amount
 
04:20:56.330 --> 04:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
of money likely to be and you know
 
04:20:58.729 --> 04:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
what's the real reason for increasing it
 
04:21:01.370 --> 04:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
so much and especially if this is going
 
04:21:03.710 --> 04:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
to also another thing that it might
 
04:21:05.809 --> 04:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
impact is all these things that we say
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
Okay free and reduced meals you get more
 
04:21:11.750 --> 04:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
money in in your school budget if you
 
04:21:13.670 --> 04:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
have more in free and reduced meals if
 
04:21:16.130 --> 04:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
this is an attempt to to increase the
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
population that's getting that stipend
 
04:21:21.530 --> 04:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
then this would be unaffordable if it's
 
04:21:24.469 --> 04:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
used in that same way so this needs a
 
04:21:26.570 --> 04:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
lot of work a lot of look so we put it
 
04:21:29.090 --> 04:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
in there because it passed the house but
 
04:21:30.410 --> 04:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to go on to the
 
04:21:31.309 --> 04:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
Senate they're going to have to make
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
judgment on it at our point we we did
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
not have the money in in the budget and
 
04:21:37.490 --> 04:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
we don't have even a fiscal note that we
 
04:21:39.889 --> 04:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
could make a guess and also as I say the
 
04:21:41.809 --> 04:21:41.819 align:start position:0%
effect on the other distributions under
 
04:21:43.849 --> 04:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
free and reduced so
 
04:21:46.189 --> 04:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
this is uh past the house we got to do
 
04:21:48.469 --> 04:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
something with it we put it in but we
 
04:21:50.929 --> 04:21:50.939 align:start position:0%
put this this line in there subject to
 
04:21:52.910 --> 04:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
available funds so
 
04:21:55.370 --> 04:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
it's there but it's not funded at this
 
04:21:55.380 --> 04:21:58.130 align:start position:0%
it's there but it's not funded at this
point

04:21:58.130 --> 04:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:03.769 --> 04:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.210 --> 04:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
shooting up

finance committee uh just to get you
 
04:37:09.650 --> 04:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
oriented uh there are going to be two
 
04:37:11.810 --> 04:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
primary documents I'm going to talk off
 
04:37:14.150 --> 04:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
of the pro the first document the
 
04:37:16.789 --> 04:37:16.799 align:start position:0%
kickoff is labeled uh house finance
 
04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
division three hb1 and hb2 proposed
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
amendments I'll go through the
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
Amendments first and then we'll go
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
through the longer sheet that's titled
 
04:37:30.709 --> 04:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
detail change house finance versus
 
04:37:32.869 --> 04:37:32.879 align:start position:0%
Governor division three category five
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
Because by the time we get through the
 
04:37:37.250 --> 04:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
Amendments we'll have talked pretty much
 
04:37:38.689 --> 04:37:38.699 align:start position:0%
about everything that's in the other
 
04:37:42.590 --> 04:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:46.010 --> 04:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
um first I'd like to just point out uh
 
04:37:47.929 --> 04:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
how great I think that the the
 
04:37:49.849 --> 04:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:37:52.609 --> 04:37:52.619 align:start position:0%
as well as the Veterans Home has
 
04:37:56.949 --> 04:37:56.959 align:start position:0%
responded to our need for information
 
04:38:00.349 --> 04:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh the the thoroughness of what they've
 
04:38:03.470 --> 04:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
provided us the collegiality in which
 
04:38:05.449 --> 04:38:05.459 align:start position:0%
it's been offered I want to thank
 
04:38:08.330 --> 04:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
commissioner Weaver for that and Mr
 
04:38:11.449 --> 04:38:11.459 align:start position:0%
Nathan white and uh and really all of
 
04:38:13.849 --> 04:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
the division directors have spent all
 
04:38:16.970 --> 04:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
kinds of time with us and of course none
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
of that would have been coordinated on
 
04:38:21.949 --> 04:38:21.959 align:start position:0%
behalf of the the division and the in
 
04:38:24.650 --> 04:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
the committee without Mr Kevin Ripple
 
04:38:27.230 --> 04:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
and I maybe Mr Kane had a little bit to
 
04:38:28.730 --> 04:38:28.740 align:start position:0%
do with it I wouldn't give him too much
 
04:38:32.029 --> 04:38:32.039 align:start position:0%
credit but uh I'd really say Mr Ripple
 
04:38:34.970 --> 04:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
has just been absolutely amazing
 
04:38:37.310 --> 04:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
04:38:40.429 --> 04:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to give you sort of uh what
 
04:38:43.010 --> 04:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
I I would consider the Strategic
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
imperative of what division three was
 
04:38:48.230 --> 04:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
looking at this time around we were
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
04:38:54.170 --> 04:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
um a a an hb17 from ways and means that
 
04:38:56.631 --> 04:38:56.641 align:start position:0%
had a smaller amount of money in it than
 
04:38:58.929 --> 04:38:58.939 align:start position:0%
what the governor spent
 
04:39:03.769 --> 04:39:03.779 align:start position:0%
there's a talk of of a recession and
 
04:39:06.709 --> 04:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
thankfully we have a nice rainy day fund
 
04:39:09.410 --> 04:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
to you know kind of protect some of the
 
04:39:12.830 --> 04:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
worst concerns from that but but then we
 
04:39:15.650 --> 04:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
but then we also recognize that within
 
04:39:19.369 --> 04:39:19.379 align:start position:0%
the state uh our one of our biggest
 
04:39:21.890 --> 04:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
challenges kind of the unavoidable thing
 
04:39:24.890 --> 04:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
in our in front of us is that the
 
04:39:28.070 --> 04:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
emergency room boarding situation is
 
04:39:32.269 --> 04:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
just unacceptable and it's essential
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
that we take whatever limited resources
 
04:39:37.970 --> 04:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
we have we have limited resources and we
 
04:39:40.010 --> 04:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
have unlimited wants and that's kind of
 
04:39:41.930 --> 04:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
the first rule of Economics regardless
 
04:39:45.770 --> 04:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
of where you go so we had to take our
 
04:39:48.590 --> 04:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
limited resources to and to apply them
 
04:39:51.948 --> 04:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
in a way in which you know I think we uh
 
04:39:55.730 --> 04:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
have leveraged them fairly well and the
 
04:39:57.890 --> 04:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget
 
04:40:01.130 --> 04:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
um what he proposed was a 3.1 percent
 
04:40:04.368 --> 04:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
across the board Medicaid fix and I'm
 
04:40:06.288 --> 04:40:06.298 align:start position:0%
not I'm not talking yet even to an
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm just doing an overview
 
04:40:11.868 --> 04:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
what what he talked about was a 3.1
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
percent across the board Medicaid rate
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
increase and
 
04:40:20.510 --> 04:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
um 3.1 percent if you take a look at the
 
04:40:21.970 --> 04:40:21.980 align:start position:0%
ER boarding
 
04:40:25.550 --> 04:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
situation uh which is I think in a
 
04:40:29.090 --> 04:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
crisis almost third worldly
 
04:40:30.610 --> 04:40:30.620 align:start position:0%
um we
 
04:40:33.410 --> 04:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
really needed to address that and the
 
04:40:36.170 --> 04:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent wasn't going to get us there
 
04:40:39.830 --> 04:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
in his verbiage the governor told us
 
04:40:42.110 --> 04:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
that if we wanted to try to Target
 
04:40:45.110 --> 04:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement rates that that
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
we were encouraged to do so so in the
 
04:40:50.708 --> 04:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
five or six months that the the
 
04:40:52.910 --> 04:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
executive branch put together their
 
04:40:55.970 --> 04:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
budget they did not provide us or offer
 
04:41:00.250 --> 04:41:00.260 align:start position:0%
us a a methodology to do the medicated
 
04:41:03.530 --> 04:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement targeted rate
 
04:41:03.540 --> 04:41:04.670 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement targeted rate
increases

04:41:04.670 --> 04:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
increases
 
04:41:04.680 --> 04:41:06.230 align:start position:0%
increases
so

04:41:06.230 --> 04:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:08.150 --> 04:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
um so I'll talk some more about that
 
04:41:10.190 --> 04:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
later but I just wanted to tee up the
 
04:41:12.590 --> 04:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
idea that given that we were already
 
04:41:14.930 --> 04:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
spending more than the governor or uh
 
04:41:17.208 --> 04:41:17.218 align:start position:0%
well that we had less money than what
 
04:41:19.250 --> 04:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
the governor had available to us and
 
04:41:22.310 --> 04:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
that we had this major uh strategic
 
04:41:24.288 --> 04:41:24.298 align:start position:0%
imperative that the governor hadn't
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
funded we were looking for Bill payers
 
04:41:29.270 --> 04:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
we were looking for ways to save some
 
04:41:32.930 --> 04:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
money and and particularly when we know
 
04:41:34.910 --> 04:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
that we got these raises that aren't in
 
04:41:37.850 --> 04:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
hb1 the 10 percent the two percent uh
 
04:41:40.368 --> 04:41:40.378 align:start position:0%
respectively in the two years
 
04:41:43.670 --> 04:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
um so so with that I I offer kind of as
 
04:41:47.050 --> 04:41:47.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:47.060 --> 04:41:49.448 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

04:41:49.448 --> 04:41:49.458 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
1196 hotel that's on page three
 
04:41:57.350 --> 04:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh this is a often referred to as a back
 
04:41:59.590 --> 04:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
of a budget cut
 
04:42:02.628 --> 04:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
and it's identical to what's in the
 
04:42:06.110 --> 04:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
current year or the current budget the
 
04:42:07.750 --> 04:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
it it it
 
04:42:11.390 --> 04:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
basically says that they are once they
 
04:42:14.448 --> 04:42:14.458 align:start position:0%
get the their entire budget they have to
 
04:42:17.628 --> 04:42:17.638 align:start position:0%
reduce it by 30.4 million
 
04:42:21.288 --> 04:42:21.298 align:start position:0%
um by the end of the uh biennium I want
 
04:42:22.970 --> 04:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
to take that money I want to put that
 
04:42:26.810 --> 04:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
towards Medicaid reimbursement rates and
 
04:42:29.868 --> 04:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
and given that inflation is so strong
 
04:42:31.788 --> 04:42:31.798 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion about
 
04:42:34.390 --> 04:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
increasing this 23.4 million to an
 
04:42:36.890 --> 04:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
inflation-adjusted number we chose not
 
04:42:38.868 --> 04:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
to do that we didn't want to put the
 
04:42:40.610 --> 04:42:40.620 align:start position:0%
extra pressure on the department they
 
04:42:43.850 --> 04:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
they handled this this current budget
 
04:42:45.830 --> 04:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
year they can handle it next time I
 
04:42:48.310 --> 04:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
believe and then we kept the number of
 
04:42:48.320 --> 04:42:50.530 align:start position:0%
believe and then we kept the number of
permanent

04:42:50.530 --> 04:42:50.540 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
04:42:54.670 --> 04:42:54.680 align:start position:0%
full-time employees at 3
 
04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
they are authorized something in the
 
04:43:00.590 --> 04:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of uh 3224 somewhere in
 
04:43:00.600 --> 04:43:01.730 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of uh 3224 somewhere in
there

04:43:01.730 --> 04:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:43:05.690 --> 04:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
um and and this imposes a a ceiling of
 
04:43:08.090 --> 04:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
three thousand and if I've done the math
 
04:43:10.970 --> 04:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
right they've got about a 19 vacancy
 
04:43:13.850 --> 04:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
rate which means they probably have at
 
04:43:15.890 --> 04:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
least 500 positions they could fill
 
04:43:18.890 --> 04:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
before hitting that three thousand so I
 
04:43:22.250 --> 04:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
think the Practical effect of the 3000
 
04:43:26.448 --> 04:43:26.458 align:start position:0%
is probably not particularly bad given
 
04:43:30.050 --> 04:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
the uh the workforce shortages so so I
 
04:43:33.170 --> 04:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
I'm spending so much time on 1196
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
because it sets a critical Cornerstone
 
04:43:37.850 --> 04:43:37.860 align:start position:0%
to understanding the division three
 
04:43:37.860 --> 04:43:39.670 align:start position:0%
to understanding the division three
strategy

04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
04:43:42.830 --> 04:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
uh we're not taking questions are we at
 
04:43:46.250 --> 04:43:46.260 align:start position:0%
this point or are we why not I I don't
 
04:43:48.530 --> 04:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
see one but my I have one over here okay
 
04:43:48.540 --> 04:43:50.990 align:start position:0%
see one but my I have one over here okay

walner

04:43:53.150 --> 04:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
walner
 
04:43:54.830 --> 04:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
um speaking about the budget reduction
 
04:44:00.890 --> 04:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
in the back of the uh budget
 
04:44:04.550 --> 04:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
this originally came the the first one
 
04:44:07.788 --> 04:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
we saw was a reduction in Staffing I
 
04:44:07.798 --> 04:44:09.530 align:start position:0%
we saw was a reduction in Staffing I
believe

04:44:09.530 --> 04:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:44:15.490 --> 04:44:15.500 align:start position:0%
this one is just a 23 million dollar
 
04:44:19.910 --> 04:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
reduction of the of the um budget by the
 
04:44:22.190 --> 04:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
general fund budget
 
04:44:25.190 --> 04:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
don't we risk when we do that don't we
 
04:44:28.250 --> 04:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
also risk losing federal funds because
 
04:44:31.368 --> 04:44:31.378 align:start position:0%
so much of the department budget is
 
04:44:34.190 --> 04:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
matched with federal funds so that 23
 
04:44:37.690 --> 04:44:37.700 align:start position:0%
can easily become 40 million dollar loss
 
04:44:40.128 --> 04:44:40.138 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question this is
 
04:44:42.310 --> 04:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
the same debate that we had as we
 
04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
formalized the current budget that we're
 
04:44:45.120 --> 04:44:45.850 align:start position:0%
formalized the current budget that we're
in

04:44:45.850 --> 04:44:45.860 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:44:50.208 --> 04:44:50.218 align:start position:0%
rather than expand and extend this we
 
04:44:52.368 --> 04:44:52.378 align:start position:0%
decided to relent and hold fast with
 
04:44:55.010 --> 04:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
where we were these are funds that the
 
04:44:57.310 --> 04:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
department can choose to
 
04:45:00.050 --> 04:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
save during the course of a two-year
 
04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
period being smart enlightened managers
 
04:45:06.650 --> 04:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
I would expect that they would take a
 
04:45:08.868 --> 04:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
look at how they could reduce General
 
04:45:11.570 --> 04:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
funding in a way to minimize or mitigate
 
04:45:14.448 --> 04:45:14.458 align:start position:0%
any risk of federal loss of federal
 
04:45:17.090 --> 04:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
revenue and again because some of these
 
04:45:19.610 --> 04:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
monies that we budget are due to
 
04:45:22.868 --> 04:45:22.878 align:start position:0%
Personnel anticipated that will never
 
04:45:26.448 --> 04:45:26.458 align:start position:0%
hire there's probably already some room
 
04:45:28.490 --> 04:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
built in there to where we weren't going
 
04:45:34.368 --> 04:45:34.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:36.708 --> 04:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
isn't it isn't it true though that the
 
04:45:37.970 --> 04:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
like every other department of in the
 
04:45:44.470 --> 04:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
state will also have a a lapse amount
 
04:45:48.770 --> 04:45:48.780 align:start position:0%
that will be expected of them the
 
04:45:51.170 --> 04:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
governor will allocate those those
 
04:45:54.230 --> 04:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
lapses and require the Departments to
 
04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
lapse them so the Department of Health
 
04:45:58.430 --> 04:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
and Human Services will be looking at a
 
04:46:01.030 --> 04:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
23 million dollar
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
reduction through this amendment plus
 
04:46:07.910 --> 04:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
whatever they are allocated through the
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
lapse process
 
04:46:12.830 --> 04:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that you have a point I
 
04:46:15.288 --> 04:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
would say it's probably a fair and good
 
04:46:20.270 --> 04:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
one but it's not within the purview of
 
04:46:24.050 --> 04:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
division three division three is putting
 
04:46:25.990 --> 04:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
this back of the budget
 
04:46:29.208 --> 04:46:29.218 align:start position:0%
proposal together and any lapse might
 
04:46:31.368 --> 04:46:31.378 align:start position:0%
come from somebody else it may come from
 
04:46:32.930 --> 04:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
the total finance committee it might
 
04:46:34.788 --> 04:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
come from the governor but I don't have
 
04:46:37.550 --> 04:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
any controller or authority over that so
 
04:46:42.350 --> 04:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
so again this is exactly what was in the
 
04:46:43.850 --> 04:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
current budget that they're living
 
04:46:47.330 --> 04:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
within and uh and and based on the
 
04:46:48.890 --> 04:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
testimony it seems like they're doing
 
04:46:48.900 --> 04:46:51.470 align:start position:0%
testimony it seems like they're doing
okay

04:46:51.470 --> 04:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:51.480 --> 04:46:54.350 align:start position:0%
 
she

04:46:54.350 --> 04:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:54.360 --> 04:46:55.190 align:start position:0%
 
EP

04:46:55.190 --> 04:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
EP
 
04:46:59.868 --> 04:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair
 
04:47:03.230 --> 04:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
I'm very confused you say that you want
 
04:47:05.390 --> 04:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
them to have a back of the budget cut of
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
23 million if I'm reading your
 
04:47:11.270 --> 04:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet correctly their total
 
04:47:14.690 --> 04:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
general fund budget is 33 million
 
04:47:17.448 --> 04:47:17.458 align:start position:0%
and that seems
 
04:47:20.350 --> 04:47:20.360 align:start position:0%
no look I'm missing something yeah no
 
04:47:23.930 --> 04:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
there are General funds are in like a
 
04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
billion so I'll let Mr Ripple speak to
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
the specific number
 
04:47:32.150 --> 04:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
yes I'd have to look up the general fund
 
04:47:33.708 --> 04:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
figure in the budget but the figures on
 
04:47:35.448 --> 04:47:35.458 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet reflect the changes made
 
04:47:37.128 --> 04:47:37.138 align:start position:0%
by division three not the total budget
 
04:47:42.410 --> 04:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:47.150 --> 04:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes please so is this a 20 cut
 
04:47:50.510 --> 04:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
a two percent cut the he's going to find
 
04:47:52.250 --> 04:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
the exact number but let's say it's a
 
04:47:55.190 --> 04:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
billion dollars 23 million is 2.3
 
04:47:55.200 --> 04:47:57.170 align:start position:0%
billion dollars 23 million is 2.3
percent

04:47:57.170 --> 04:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:47:59.208 --> 04:47:59.218 align:start position:0%
and this is two per two point three
 
04:48:02.208 --> 04:48:02.218 align:start position:0%
percent over the two years so it might
 
04:48:04.868 --> 04:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
actually be you know one point something
 
04:48:07.730 --> 04:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
and and done in a way in which they can
 
04:48:09.890 --> 04:48:09.900 align:start position:0%
plan and anticipate and manage their
 
04:48:09.900 --> 04:48:10.910 align:start position:0%
plan and anticipate and manage their
priorities

04:48:10.910 --> 04:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
04:48:13.610 --> 04:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
thank you I understand thank you for the
 
04:48:16.490 --> 04:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
question horizontal sheet shows 2
 
04:48:21.470 --> 04:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
billion or 200 million for the uh
 
04:48:29.030 --> 04:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:30.590 --> 04:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
so when the governor's recommended
 
04:48:32.270 --> 04:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
budget the general funds Appropriations
 
04:48:34.430 --> 04:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
are slightly over a billion dollars per
 
04:48:34.440 --> 04:48:39.350 align:start position:0%
are slightly over a billion dollars per
year

04:48:39.350 --> 04:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:42.050 --> 04:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh one per one percent and change
 
04:48:44.448 --> 04:48:44.458 align:start position:0%
because this 23 million is over the two
 
04:48:46.628 --> 04:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
years and it's over a billion a years
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
appropriated so we're talking about one
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
percent and loose change
 
04:48:56.810 --> 04:48:56.820 align:start position:0%
and you just would hope that we had
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
management competence to handle a one
 
04:49:04.190 --> 04:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:05.750 --> 04:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
for the questions or comments
 
04:49:07.970 --> 04:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
representative hack and Phillips
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:49:12.650 --> 04:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
my question I'm just trying to think
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
um and I can't pinpoint it so I'm
 
04:49:16.550 --> 04:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
wondering representative are there any
 
04:49:18.470 --> 04:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
other departments in our budget plans
 
04:49:20.628 --> 04:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
that are also required to make these
 
04:49:24.350 --> 04:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
cuts and caps as I said before you got
 
04:49:26.448 --> 04:49:26.458 align:start position:0%
here and in the current budget this is
 
04:49:28.070 --> 04:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
word for word what we're doing in the
 
04:49:30.170 --> 04:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
current budget so I'd say there's uh
 
04:49:32.750 --> 04:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
definitely precedent for this uh this
 
04:49:35.570 --> 04:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
precedent I as I understand goes back uh
 
04:49:38.690 --> 04:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
to a prior chairman I won't you know
 
04:49:40.190 --> 04:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
from where
 
04:49:46.970 --> 04:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:49.490 --> 04:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
Human Services or are you speaking to
 
04:49:51.230 --> 04:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
every Department
 
04:49:54.410 --> 04:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
I'm only authorized at this point to
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
talk about division three which is the
 
04:49:57.610 --> 04:49:57.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:50:02.510 --> 04:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
plus veterans the veterans home which is
 
04:50:06.650 --> 04:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
not included in the uh this amendment
 
04:50:08.890 --> 04:50:08.900 align:start position:0%
representative Earth for a question
 
04:50:12.110 --> 04:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
just a comment uh related to what the
 
04:50:15.230 --> 04:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
chairman was saying uh the Department of
 
04:50:17.628 --> 04:50:17.638 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services has known the
 
04:50:19.850 --> 04:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
very large over budgeting
 
04:50:22.010 --> 04:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
areas and one of the ones he mentioned
 
04:50:24.830 --> 04:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
was the Staffing
 
04:50:28.070 --> 04:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
um the the huge vacancies some of which
 
04:50:29.750 --> 04:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't these not specifically
 
04:50:31.430 --> 04:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
related even to covert or the current
 
04:50:33.530 --> 04:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
issue with Staffing in general a lot of
 
04:50:35.690 --> 04:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
these vacancies go back to 2018. so it
 
04:50:37.910 --> 04:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
is a different department from the
 
04:50:40.550 --> 04:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
others in the state and there's just
 
04:50:43.490 --> 04:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
huge dollars that are being
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
um allocated to it
 
04:50:48.890 --> 04:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for contributing that
 
04:50:52.128 --> 04:50:52.138 align:start position:0%
um uh I appreciate it also I was born
 
04:50:55.550 --> 04:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
out that that anything we save
 
04:50:59.890 --> 04:50:59.900 align:start position:0%
we're trying to put into the Medicaid
 
04:51:02.810 --> 04:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate increase which is
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
intended to solve the number one
 
04:51:06.708 --> 04:51:06.718 align:start position:0%
critical problem facing our health care
 
04:51:08.590 --> 04:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
System right now which is the ER
 
04:51:12.590 --> 04:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
boarding crisis so you know I I had
 
04:51:14.270 --> 04:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
asked the executive branch for Bill
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
payers and and not seeing any in the
 
04:51:22.128 --> 04:51:22.138 align:start position:0%
proposed budget this is a way to find 23
 
04:51:24.170 --> 04:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
million that we can invest in our
 
04:51:25.670 --> 04:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
patient care
 
04:51:28.070 --> 04:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for question
 
04:51:31.128 --> 04:51:31.138 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
04:51:34.070 --> 04:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
um is it true that um you know some some
 
04:51:36.288 --> 04:51:36.298 align:start position:0%
areas for example the developmentally
 
04:51:40.070 --> 04:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
disabled budget that wouldn't be able to
 
04:51:43.070 --> 04:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
be touched by this amendment while the
 
04:51:45.110 --> 04:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
most likely place would be payroll where
 
04:51:47.750 --> 04:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uh vacancy right now
 
04:51:50.090 --> 04:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
with a high likelihood of not being
 
04:51:52.550 --> 04:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
filled so
 
04:51:54.890 --> 04:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
um if it and if it was entirely from
 
04:51:58.430 --> 04:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
payroll we'd be looking at uh seven to
 
04:52:00.708 --> 04:52:00.718 align:start position:0%
eight percent out of this 19 current
 
04:52:06.288 --> 04:52:06.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:07.850 --> 04:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
that would have been a good division
 
04:52:10.610 --> 04:52:10.620 align:start position:0%
three uh conversation to have
 
04:52:12.770 --> 04:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
um I I don't recall having that
 
04:52:16.190 --> 04:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
conversation I would have asked the
 
04:52:19.490 --> 04:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
department to prepare a more detailed
 
04:52:22.430 --> 04:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
laydown of how the existing back of the
 
04:52:25.010 --> 04:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
budget cut that they're already dealing
 
04:52:27.590 --> 04:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
with where those dollars came from
 
04:52:29.990 --> 04:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
specifically but I didn't anticipate the
 
04:52:33.288 --> 04:52:33.298 align:start position:0%
question I might I apologize
 
04:52:36.830 --> 04:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
I I do think last year that the her last
 
04:52:36.840 --> 04:52:38.390 align:start position:0%
I I do think last year that the her last
biennium

04:52:38.390 --> 04:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
04:52:41.170 --> 04:52:41.180 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
04:52:44.330 --> 04:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
back of the budget was targeting payroll
 
04:52:46.810 --> 04:52:46.820 align:start position:0%
entirely while this time
 
04:52:49.190 --> 04:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
the department is being given more
 
04:52:51.948 --> 04:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
flexibility if there is anything in
 
04:52:55.250 --> 04:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
contracts or otherwise that could be
 
04:52:55.260 --> 04:52:55.850 align:start position:0%
contracts or otherwise that could be
um

04:52:55.850 --> 04:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:00.830 --> 04:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh or would not be used that um they
 
04:53:04.070 --> 04:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
could be taking it taken to account for
 
04:53:07.010 --> 04:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
this as well so you know thank you for
 
04:53:08.930 --> 04:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
your comment and I do recall that we did
 
04:53:11.090 --> 04:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
amend this it's not exactly what the
 
04:53:14.330 --> 04:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
current uh back of the budget is because
 
04:53:16.550 --> 04:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
you're you're right we did put some more
 
04:53:18.530 --> 04:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
flexibility in here I don't remember the
 
04:53:21.708 --> 04:53:21.718 align:start position:0%
word usage we did exactly but the intent
 
04:53:24.650 --> 04:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
was to uh to take some of the pain and
 
04:53:26.930 --> 04:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
pressure off the department by making it
 
04:53:29.390 --> 04:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
more flexible to get to the number yes
 
04:53:31.730 --> 04:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you next question from
 
04:53:33.110 --> 04:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire followed by
 
04:53:35.270 --> 04:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative grassy thank you Mr
 
04:53:38.270 --> 04:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
chairman twice you've used the phrase ER
 
04:53:41.690 --> 04:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
boarding what is that
 
04:53:44.930 --> 04:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
all right so I it's been in the news a
 
04:53:47.448 --> 04:53:47.458 align:start position:0%
lot and I I apologize for assuming folks
 
04:53:49.190 --> 04:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
may know what it is I should have
 
04:53:52.670 --> 04:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
explained it better but we we have
 
04:53:52.680 --> 04:53:53.330 align:start position:0%
explained it better but we we have
um

04:53:53.330 --> 04:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:55.730 --> 04:53:55.740 align:start position:0%
some number of emergency rooms within
 
04:53:57.770 --> 04:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire right I'm
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
going to say 26 that's plus or minus a
 
04:54:04.030 --> 04:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
few I think and each in each of those
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
facilities if somebody is brought to
 
04:54:11.030 --> 04:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
their emergency room that's in need of
 
04:54:11.040 --> 04:54:12.670 align:start position:0%
their emergency room that's in need of
of

04:54:12.670 --> 04:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
significant mental health or behavioral
 
04:54:17.810 --> 04:54:17.820 align:start position:0%
health care if they're perceived to be a
 
04:54:20.470 --> 04:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
danger to themselves or to others
 
04:54:24.830 --> 04:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
then it's only appropriate for that
 
04:54:27.590 --> 04:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
emergency room to discharge that patient
 
04:54:29.390 --> 04:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
and do an appropriate Health Care
 
04:54:31.970 --> 04:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
setting that can meet their their mental
 
04:54:34.270 --> 04:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
or Behavioral Health needs
 
04:54:39.110 --> 04:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
we have a critical shortage in beds to
 
04:54:42.590 --> 04:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
receive all of those patients and since
 
04:54:45.230 --> 04:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
the patients are coming in at a rate in
 
04:54:47.810 --> 04:54:47.820 align:start position:0%
which it exceeds the ability to
 
04:54:51.530 --> 04:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
discharge them you build this back up in
 
04:54:54.410 --> 04:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
the emergency rooms and what that backup
 
04:54:58.490 --> 04:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
does is since the hospitals are not
 
04:55:01.250 --> 04:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
actually treating the patients within
 
04:55:04.730 --> 04:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
their care requirements they cannot get
 
04:55:07.788 --> 04:55:07.798 align:start position:0%
reimbursed so they are absorbing all of
 
04:55:11.628 --> 04:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with maintaining
 
04:55:15.230 --> 04:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
that patient in a minimal bed
 
04:55:17.330 --> 04:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
environment in which it's essentially
 
04:55:19.970 --> 04:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
you're keeping them safe and you're
 
04:55:22.190 --> 04:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
feeding them and and that sort of thing
 
04:55:24.470 --> 04:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
but they aren't getting care they're
 
04:55:27.410 --> 04:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
simply being boarded I I have callously
 
04:55:30.948 --> 04:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
used the word the term ER warehousing
 
04:55:34.010 --> 04:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
because I I just find it outrageous that
 
04:55:36.288 --> 04:55:36.298 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire finds itself in a
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
situation in which these patients are
 
04:55:41.570 --> 04:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
being stacked up in the emergency rooms
 
04:55:44.628 --> 04:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
without anywhere to go and so as we took
 
04:55:46.930 --> 04:55:46.940 align:start position:0%
a look at the Medicaid
 
04:55:51.470 --> 04:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate hike opportunities my
 
04:55:53.690 --> 04:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
first priority in that was to build
 
04:55:58.070 --> 04:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
capacity on the discharge or on the well
 
04:55:59.990 --> 04:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
for in the hospital it looks like the
 
04:56:02.628 --> 04:56:02.638 align:start position:0%
discharge side but from the community it
 
04:56:04.730 --> 04:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
looks like a you know bringing them into
 
04:56:08.810 --> 04:56:08.820 align:start position:0%
the Community Care situation so
 
04:56:11.090 --> 04:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
um so you'll we'll talk more about that
 
04:56:13.970 --> 04:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
later but you know that's that's sort of
 
04:56:17.150 --> 04:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
a nutshell of what the ER boarding issue
 
04:56:21.530 --> 04:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:23.090 --> 04:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
representative grassy thank you Mr
 
04:56:23.100 --> 04:56:24.110 align:start position:0%
representative grassy thank you Mr
chairman

04:56:24.110 --> 04:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:56:26.090 --> 04:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
um I noticed you said that this back of
 
04:56:27.170 --> 04:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
the budget cut that you're looking at
 
04:56:28.610 --> 04:56:28.620 align:start position:0%
was something that we've done previously
 
04:56:30.590 --> 04:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not something that's unusual but
 
04:56:31.550 --> 04:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you one of the biggest
 
04:56:33.708 --> 04:56:33.718 align:start position:0%
complaints I have from constituents is
 
04:56:37.610 --> 04:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
the lack of the waiting time to get
 
04:56:40.490 --> 04:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
services or with agencies
 
04:56:40.500 --> 04:56:41.330 align:start position:0%
services or with agencies
um

04:56:41.330 --> 04:56:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:44.170 --> 04:56:44.180 align:start position:0%
support agencies in our communities that
 
04:56:46.670 --> 04:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
have extraordinary extraordinary
 
04:56:49.490 --> 04:56:49.500 align:start position:0%
problems getting Services back from from
 
04:56:52.970 --> 04:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
DHHS and that you know that there's just
 
04:56:54.350 --> 04:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
the complaint they always hear is
 
04:56:56.390 --> 04:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
there's just not enough Staffing and I'm
 
04:56:58.010 --> 04:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
wondering if a cut like this could be
 
04:57:01.070 --> 04:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
making the situation worse by you say
 
04:57:02.690 --> 04:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
they can't fill positions well are they
 
04:57:05.390 --> 04:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
holding positions open to meet this this
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
cut and not filling the positions that
 
04:57:09.288 --> 04:57:09.298 align:start position:0%
they probably should be for positions
 
04:57:11.448 --> 04:57:11.458 align:start position:0%
that they should probably should be
 
04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
filling in order to provide adequate
 
04:57:15.650 --> 04:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
services to our citizens and and the
 
04:57:17.810 --> 04:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
agencies that serve our citizens
 
04:57:19.910 --> 04:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
I I don't think they are as the short
 
04:57:21.948 --> 04:57:21.958 align:start position:0%
answer and to get provided a little bit
 
04:57:24.590 --> 04:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
more background as you know we have a
 
04:57:27.470 --> 04:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage uh across the state
 
04:57:29.868 --> 04:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
and pretty much every area and
 
04:57:31.430 --> 04:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
specifically within the healthcare
 
04:57:34.310 --> 04:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
provider community and
 
04:57:38.050 --> 04:57:38.060 align:start position:0%
um and so we're all chasing the same
 
04:57:43.910 --> 04:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
scarce Personnel Resources uh so do I do
 
04:57:47.030 --> 04:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
I think this imposition of the 3000 on
 
04:57:50.810 --> 04:57:50.820 align:start position:0%
the head count is contributing to the
 
04:57:53.810 --> 04:57:53.820 align:start position:0%
inability of DHHS to perform its Mission
 
04:57:56.930 --> 04:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
I would say that the primary challenges
 
04:57:58.730 --> 04:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
they have from a Personnel perspective
 
04:58:01.670 --> 04:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
are really driven by the workforce
 
04:58:04.610 --> 04:58:04.620 align:start position:0%
shortage throughout the state and to the
 
04:58:08.030 --> 04:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
extent that if I were able to pick and
 
04:58:11.090 --> 04:58:11.100 align:start position:0%
choose where people would go work I
 
04:58:14.330 --> 04:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
would tend to want to prioritize the
 
04:58:17.810 --> 04:58:17.820 align:start position:0%
Direct Care provision in DHHS they don't
 
04:58:20.690 --> 04:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
actually do direct health care and so
 
04:58:23.510 --> 04:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
where I'm seeing the crisis overall is
 
04:58:25.910 --> 04:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
in the communities that need to be able
 
04:58:28.190 --> 04:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
to receive the patients and provide
 
04:58:30.650 --> 04:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
Hands-On or you know otherwise
 
04:58:33.170 --> 04:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
therapeutic care to them and having that
 
04:58:36.110 --> 04:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
employee in the community rather than in
 
04:58:38.930 --> 04:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
Concord in office building between the
 
04:58:41.030 --> 04:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
two I would have my priority being out
 
04:58:44.150 --> 04:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
in the community treating patients
 
04:58:47.628 --> 04:58:47.638 align:start position:0%
uh just just a point on this is that a
 
04:58:49.070 --> 04:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
lot of times the problem of being able
 
04:58:50.690 --> 04:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
to provide that service in the community
 
04:58:51.890 --> 04:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
is they're not getting their
 
04:58:53.868 --> 04:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so they're not getting the
 
04:58:56.990 --> 04:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
necessary paperwork from DHHS I know
 
04:58:58.368 --> 04:58:58.378 align:start position:0%
that if you take a look at some of the
 
04:58:59.570 --> 04:58:59.580 align:start position:0%
situations that are going on in child
 
04:59:01.250 --> 04:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
care I mean it takes forever to get
 
04:59:02.690 --> 04:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
certification sometimes for people and
 
04:59:03.830 --> 04:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of times it's paperwork
 
04:59:06.050 --> 04:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
through DHHS before you can even hire
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
somebody or you can get somebody or you
 
04:59:10.910 --> 04:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
can take a new person on into your
 
04:59:12.830 --> 04:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
program if you can't get the paperwork
 
04:59:15.110 --> 04:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
taken care of
 
04:59:18.288 --> 04:59:18.298 align:start position:0%
okay so so you brought up two issues one
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
you started talking about reimbursements
 
04:59:23.448 --> 04:59:23.458 align:start position:0%
that the reimbursements are too low and
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'm taking whatever money
 
04:59:28.490 --> 04:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
we can find from the bill payers to help
 
04:59:31.490 --> 04:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
increase the uh the reimbursement rates
 
04:59:33.590 --> 04:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
later we haven't gotten to that part of
 
04:59:35.930 --> 04:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
the conversation the theory is if we can
 
04:59:37.550 --> 04:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
increase the reimbursements we can
 
04:59:39.890 --> 04:59:39.900 align:start position:0%
increase the capacity we can improve
 
04:59:42.890 --> 04:59:42.900 align:start position:0%
increase the ability to move patients
 
04:59:45.170 --> 04:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
through the system so care should get
 
04:59:47.150 --> 04:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
better to the extent that there's an
 
04:59:49.910 --> 04:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility issue we've been we've got
 
04:59:52.670 --> 04:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
money in here invested in continuing to
 
04:59:55.850 --> 04:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
uh upgrade and improve the new height
 
04:59:58.550 --> 04:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
system which is the the kind of the
 
05:00:01.330 --> 05:00:01.340 align:start position:0%
universal eligibility checking system
 
05:00:04.208 --> 05:00:04.218 align:start position:0%
Meanwhile we're spending something like
 
05:00:07.010 --> 05:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
20.5 million dollars a year in
 
05:00:09.830 --> 05:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
operations and maintenance for the
 
05:00:12.230 --> 05:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
Medicaid management information system
 
05:00:15.050 --> 05:00:15.060 align:start position:0%
so we're investing so much money in it
 
05:00:18.110 --> 05:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
you were rash I'm rationalizing and
 
05:00:20.750 --> 05:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
hoping uh that the the department is
 
05:00:23.750 --> 05:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
right as if we invest in the I.T we can
 
05:00:25.850 --> 05:00:25.860 align:start position:0%
get that efficiency we can get that
 
05:00:28.128 --> 05:00:28.138 align:start position:0%
productivity out of the existing
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce so we're we're in a there is
 
05:00:35.208 --> 05:00:35.218 align:start position:0%
no one answer to this we have attempted
 
05:00:37.430 --> 05:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
to solve multiple problems and we're
 
05:00:39.830 --> 05:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
trying to keep a balanced approach to do
 
05:00:42.230 --> 05:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
the best overall we can with limited
 
05:00:47.628 --> 05:00:47.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:50.810 --> 05:00:50.820 align:start position:0%
further from committee members
 
05:00:55.788 --> 05:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none please proceed okay page two
 
05:00:59.750 --> 05:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
that's a little joke uh no but literally
 
05:01:02.330 --> 05:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh it's now page four
 
05:01:02.340 --> 05:01:05.288 align:start position:0%
uh it's now page four
so

05:01:05.288 --> 05:01:05.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:09.288 --> 05:01:09.298 align:start position:0%
uh so this is
 
05:01:13.070 --> 05:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
um a deletion on a peer-to-peer grief
 
05:01:16.128 --> 05:01:16.138 align:start position:0%
support programming in this uh the
 
05:01:19.430 --> 05:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
division voted in a very narrow way to
 
05:01:22.990 --> 05:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
eliminate this uh it's it's basically
 
05:01:28.010 --> 05:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
using fy23 money on the order of of 1.5
 
05:01:31.128 --> 05:01:31.138 align:start position:0%
million and and this gave us an
 
05:01:34.730 --> 05:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide back to the
 
05:01:38.390 --> 05:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
finance committee a total of uh this is
 
05:01:41.090 --> 05:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
just 1.5 million a very small piece of
 
05:01:44.330 --> 05:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
the 12.5 million that we estimated we
 
05:01:46.490 --> 05:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
would not need from the FY 23 money
 
05:01:50.628 --> 05:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
making it available elsewhere
 
05:01:53.170 --> 05:01:53.180 align:start position:0%
on page five
 
05:01:54.890 --> 05:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:01:54.900 --> 05:01:55.550 align:start position:0%
this is
um

05:01:55.550 --> 05:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:58.788 --> 05:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
put in because when the budget was being
 
05:02:02.770 --> 05:02:02.780 align:start position:0%
put together there was no known
 
05:02:06.230 --> 05:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
end State on how the sununu replacement
 
05:02:10.390 --> 05:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
Center would be brought together and so
 
05:02:13.390 --> 05:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment is is basically a
 
05:02:18.050 --> 05:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
vestigial organ to that and until we get
 
05:02:21.530 --> 05:02:21.540 align:start position:0%
HP 49 through the system it it I
 
05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
consider it still to be necessary
 
05:02:25.730 --> 05:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
because it's directing that all federal
 
05:02:29.868 --> 05:02:29.878 align:start position:0%
funds are all funds available that are
 
05:02:32.810 --> 05:02:32.820 align:start position:0%
federal and discretionary should be used
 
05:02:37.910 --> 05:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:42.288 --> 05:02:42.298 align:start position:0%
um then on Page Six
 
05:02:45.708 --> 05:02:45.718 align:start position:0%
uh we have a couple of items that that
 
05:02:48.708 --> 05:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
sort of are in this in in the same vein
 
05:02:51.948 --> 05:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
over the last many years a couple of
 
05:02:54.230 --> 05:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
things have happened simultaneously that
 
05:02:56.930 --> 05:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
we've tried to uh to deconflict and
 
05:02:59.330 --> 05:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
clear up so that our books are more open
 
05:03:01.550 --> 05:03:01.560 align:start position:0%
our behaviors are more transparent
 
05:03:03.590 --> 05:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
they're both kind of related to the
 
05:03:05.390 --> 05:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on Alcohol and
 
05:03:09.170 --> 05:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs when that program was
 
05:03:13.490 --> 05:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
instituted a a group of a large group of
 
05:03:15.650 --> 05:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from around the state were
 
05:03:19.550 --> 05:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
put together to take a look at the the
 
05:03:21.890 --> 05:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
Damage Done by Alcohol and Other Drugs
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
and try to figure out what we can do to
 
05:03:26.270 --> 05:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
prevent it and then treat it and to
 
05:03:29.810 --> 05:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
follow up and so in order to fund that
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
effort outside of the budget and to
 
05:03:34.430 --> 05:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
leave it to the stakeholders expertise
 
05:03:38.150 --> 05:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
and their budgeting process we there was
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
a commitment to have five percent of the
 
05:03:43.010 --> 05:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
the money that we spend through our
 
05:03:44.890 --> 05:03:44.900 align:start position:0%
liquor stores
 
05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
transferred over to the this commission
 
05:03:50.030 --> 05:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
we've not been keeping that five percent
 
05:03:54.288 --> 05:03:54.298 align:start position:0%
promise so uh so elsewhere uh we're
 
05:03:56.090 --> 05:03:56.100 align:start position:0%
keeping that promise but what this
 
05:04:00.110 --> 05:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
specific Amendment does is it takes uh
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
about 2.05 million dollars that would
 
05:04:06.050 --> 05:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
have set a very bad precedent in my view
 
05:04:08.150 --> 05:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
this was the first time that the
 
05:04:10.368 --> 05:04:10.378 align:start position:0%
commission would have started to use
 
05:04:12.110 --> 05:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
05:04:16.010 --> 05:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
we don't want to simultaneously give
 
05:04:18.410 --> 05:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
them the five percent of the liquor
 
05:04:21.770 --> 05:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
money and then also be adding General
 
05:04:23.810 --> 05:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
funds we should just do one or the other
 
05:04:25.550 --> 05:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
and in this case giving them their five
 
05:04:27.288 --> 05:04:27.298 align:start position:0%
percent which is a several year old
 
05:04:30.890 --> 05:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
promise and then not doing some of these
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
things that the governor wanted to uh
 
05:04:34.610 --> 05:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
wanted to do
 
05:04:37.730 --> 05:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
um he wanted in this specific case
 
05:04:43.190 --> 05:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
um to manage to administer administer uh
 
05:04:46.430 --> 05:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
the recovery friendly workplace
 
05:04:50.150 --> 05:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
initiative so it's not that I we're
 
05:04:53.390 --> 05:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
opposed to the to that program but
 
05:04:56.150 --> 05:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
funding it with General funds through
 
05:04:59.810 --> 05:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
the commission through to the program is
 
05:05:01.788 --> 05:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
a shell game that we shouldn't be
 
05:05:07.128 --> 05:05:07.138 align:start position:0%
playing so the the division deleted this
 
05:05:10.310 --> 05:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
on page seven
 
05:05:12.410 --> 05:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is a similar
 
05:05:15.110 --> 05:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
conversation uh you know whether the
 
05:05:18.170 --> 05:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
program is the right program or not it
 
05:05:21.530 --> 05:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
got caught up and and being part of a
 
05:05:23.150 --> 05:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
shell game that went through the
 
05:05:24.890 --> 05:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on alcohol and
 
05:05:27.288 --> 05:05:27.298 align:start position:0%
drug other drugs where we're funding it
 
05:05:28.788 --> 05:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
with General funds and then we're
 
05:05:30.590 --> 05:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
telling them that they have to go fund
 
05:05:32.690 --> 05:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
the program that we want to that
 
05:05:35.628 --> 05:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
violates the independence of that uh
 
05:05:37.730 --> 05:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
prestigious stakeholder community and
 
05:05:40.490 --> 05:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
their budgeting process so so this
 
05:05:43.128 --> 05:05:43.138 align:start position:0%
deletion on this is not meant to
 
05:05:46.010 --> 05:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
disparage the program but to ensure that
 
05:05:48.948 --> 05:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
we're behaving an honest and transparent
 
05:05:52.190 --> 05:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
way consistent with our past promises
 
05:05:53.810 --> 05:05:53.820 align:start position:0%
on page
 
05:05:53.820 --> 05:05:56.030 align:start position:0%
on page
eight

05:05:56.030 --> 05:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
eight
 
05:05:56.040 --> 05:05:59.390 align:start position:0%
eight
um

05:05:59.390 --> 05:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:03.230 --> 05:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
this has been in several Budget Trailer
 
05:06:06.650 --> 05:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
bills it basically says that the
 
05:06:09.708 --> 05:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
department has the flexibility to uh to
 
05:06:12.350 --> 05:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
fill unfunded positions as long as it
 
05:06:13.970 --> 05:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't exceed the amount of money that
 
05:06:18.288 --> 05:06:18.298 align:start position:0%
we appropriated for that Workforce and
 
05:06:21.410 --> 05:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
in an effort to clean up hb2 instead of
 
05:06:23.570 --> 05:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
having this thing pop up every two years
 
05:06:27.110 --> 05:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment makes it permanent
 
05:06:30.410 --> 05:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
on page nine
 
05:06:33.170 --> 05:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
um this this was an appropriation for
 
05:06:35.510 --> 05:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
the sununa Youth Center it started at
 
05:06:38.868 --> 05:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
about 11 million dollars but because uh
 
05:06:40.610 --> 05:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
there was uncertainty during the
 
05:06:42.590 --> 05:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
governor's phase on what would happen
 
05:06:46.010 --> 05:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
they had put it in hp2 and we directed
 
05:06:49.368 --> 05:06:49.378 align:start position:0%
to have that uh operating money put
 
05:06:53.030 --> 05:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
instead of an hb2 into hb1 so when we go
 
05:06:55.610 --> 05:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
look at hb1 later you'll see the money
 
05:06:58.250 --> 05:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
for that uh there's and and there will
 
05:07:00.490 --> 05:07:00.500 align:start position:0%
be a little bit of discussion about that
 
05:07:04.610 --> 05:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:09.170 --> 05:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
then on page 10 and 11.
 
05:07:13.788 --> 05:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
um this is for a new program that the
 
05:07:16.070 --> 05:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
state has not officially started and to
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
the extent that the private sector has
 
05:07:21.948 --> 05:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
started it it came from a request of the
 
05:07:23.810 --> 05:07:23.820 align:start position:0%
hospital Association and the Nurses
 
05:07:26.750 --> 05:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
Association The Nurses Association by
 
05:07:28.310 --> 05:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
the way agrees with this amendment
 
05:07:31.190 --> 05:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
supports this amendment uh and and what
 
05:07:34.368 --> 05:07:34.378 align:start position:0%
what happened was uh in an effort to
 
05:07:36.170 --> 05:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
establish a health care facility
 
05:07:39.948 --> 05:07:39.958 align:start position:0%
workplace violence prevention program we
 
05:07:42.708 --> 05:07:42.718 align:start position:0%
looked at that bill
 
05:07:44.690 --> 05:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
um last year god it feels like two years
 
05:07:46.610 --> 05:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
ago but we look I think we looked at it
 
05:07:49.910 --> 05:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
last year there was no fiscal note even
 
05:07:52.430 --> 05:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
though we impose new work requirements
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
and the most onerous was on the rule
 
05:07:57.590 --> 05:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
making requirements of of uh of the
 
05:07:58.970 --> 05:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:08:01.150 --> 05:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
but there were other ones as well
 
05:08:03.890 --> 05:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
no fiscal note and then for some reason
 
05:08:06.110 --> 05:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
even though we passed the law this just
 
05:08:07.730 --> 05:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
failed to find its way into the
 
05:08:09.410 --> 05:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
governor's budget so the the
 
05:08:12.530 --> 05:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
commissioner has asked that that we
 
05:08:14.208 --> 05:08:14.218 align:start position:0%
suspend the whole program
 
05:08:15.708 --> 05:08:15.718 align:start position:0%
we don't want to suspend the whole
 
05:08:17.270 --> 05:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
program we don't have to suspend the
 
05:08:19.368 --> 05:08:19.378 align:start position:0%
whole program what what this amendment
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
does is it it suspends the state's
 
05:08:26.770 --> 05:08:26.780 align:start position:0%
obligations on the program but uh
 
05:08:30.170 --> 05:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
encourages and allows the uh the private
 
05:08:32.330 --> 05:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
sector to go forward by establishing
 
05:08:34.490 --> 05:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
their commission to look at uh Health
 
05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
Care workplace violence and to identify
 
05:08:39.650 --> 05:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
Trends they have a lot of work to stand
 
05:08:41.288 --> 05:08:41.298 align:start position:0%
that commission up
 
05:08:43.750 --> 05:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
that legislation
 
05:08:46.670 --> 05:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
basically gives them the framework under
 
05:08:48.650 --> 05:08:48.660 align:start position:0%
which to do it
 
05:08:48.660 --> 05:08:50.930 align:start position:0%
which to do it
um

05:08:50.930 --> 05:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:54.650 --> 05:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
it's a vital program I think but it just
 
05:08:56.270 --> 05:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
we're just going to suspend the state
 
05:09:00.288 --> 05:09:00.298 align:start position:0%
mandates now now if the state like the
 
05:09:01.550 --> 05:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:09:04.610 --> 05:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
primarily but also the AG and labor if
 
05:09:06.650 --> 05:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
they find that they have the bandwidth
 
05:09:08.510 --> 05:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
the manpower to participate in the
 
05:09:10.850 --> 05:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
program they can certainly do that the
 
05:09:13.730 --> 05:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
this amendment allows them to do that so
 
05:09:16.190 --> 05:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
so this is this was an attempt to find a
 
05:09:18.770 --> 05:09:18.780 align:start position:0%
way to say yes without suspending the
 
05:09:20.990 --> 05:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
whole program but still allowing it to
 
05:09:22.690 --> 05:09:22.700 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
05:09:27.708 --> 05:09:27.718 align:start position:0%
item 12 is is probably the most common
 
05:09:31.250 --> 05:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
sensical amendment of all all this does
 
05:09:34.430 --> 05:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
is uh it deletes a section saying you
 
05:09:36.470 --> 05:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
can't admit people into the forensic
 
05:09:39.890 --> 05:09:39.900 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospital until the forensic
 
05:09:43.430 --> 05:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospital is built
 
05:09:46.850 --> 05:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
okay so we deleted that because it was
 
05:09:48.830 --> 05:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
the blinding flash of the obvious that
 
05:09:51.590 --> 05:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
you can't do it anyway so why put it
 
05:09:53.390 --> 05:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
into law
 
05:09:58.910 --> 05:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
on on page 13 uh we took some Kerry Ford
 
05:10:01.910 --> 05:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
funds uh aimed at supporting the
 
05:10:04.190 --> 05:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
development the developmental Services
 
05:10:06.230 --> 05:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
fund the acquired brain disorder
 
05:10:08.270 --> 05:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
Services fund the In-Home Support
 
05:10:11.868 --> 05:10:11.878 align:start position:0%
waivers we we kept that fully funded but
 
05:10:15.530 --> 05:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
instead we pulled FY 23 money forward to
 
05:10:17.628 --> 05:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
cover those expenses and you'll see that
 
05:10:21.590 --> 05:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
later when we get into the hb1 item on
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
it's on page three but it this this
 
05:10:29.390 --> 05:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
language is needed to enable hb1
 
05:10:34.730 --> 05:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
the next one is Page 14. this
 
05:10:37.550 --> 05:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
at first blush doesn't make a whole lot
 
05:10:39.590 --> 05:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
of sense to somebody who hasn't been
 
05:10:43.070 --> 05:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
focused on this for a while this this is
 
05:10:45.948 --> 05:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
sort of the financial math related to
 
05:10:48.770 --> 05:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
something called the county cap
 
05:10:53.448 --> 05:10:53.458 align:start position:0%
the county cap is uh is a a process and
 
05:10:56.208 --> 05:10:56.218 align:start position:0%
procedure under which the state and the
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
County nursing homes had long ago agreed
 
05:11:02.570 --> 05:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
on how to split some costs what the our
 
05:11:05.628 --> 05:11:05.638 align:start position:0%
attempt to do in the county cap is to
 
05:11:09.730 --> 05:11:09.740 align:start position:0%
keep the counties contribution
 
05:11:12.708 --> 05:11:12.718 align:start position:0%
towards keeping that agreement in the
 
05:11:14.930 --> 05:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
two percent range last year was exactly
 
05:11:17.990 --> 05:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
two percent uh this year or in this
 
05:11:21.110 --> 05:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
budget We are continuing the exact same
 
05:11:22.788 --> 05:11:22.798 align:start position:0%
amount of money so it's not going to be
 
05:11:24.948 --> 05:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
exactly two percent because of inflation
 
05:11:26.810 --> 05:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
and stuff but it's in that very same
 
05:11:28.610 --> 05:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
ballpark we didn't want to make any
 
05:11:32.090 --> 05:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
radical changes uh there
 
05:11:34.310 --> 05:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
um this is a really great program if you
 
05:11:37.250 --> 05:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
go and you talk to your county CFOs or
 
05:11:39.170 --> 05:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
the nursing homes and you talk about the
 
05:11:42.288 --> 05:11:42.298 align:start position:0%
county cap this provision directly saves
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
our residents property tax money in
 
05:11:47.810 --> 05:11:47.820 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County last budget I was told
 
05:11:50.030 --> 05:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
it saved them seven percentage points
 
05:11:53.090 --> 05:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
and across the whole property uh the
 
05:11:55.670 --> 05:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
county share the property tax so that's
 
05:11:58.330 --> 05:11:58.340 align:start position:0%
a pretty good one I think a one question
 
05:12:01.788 --> 05:12:01.798 align:start position:0%
thank you just a quick question vacation
 
05:12:03.530 --> 05:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
I thought I heard you say that this
 
05:12:05.390 --> 05:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
should increase in slight amounts with
 
05:12:07.310 --> 05:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
inflation but I look at it and the
 
05:12:10.368 --> 05:12:10.378 align:start position:0%
amounts were the year 23 24 and 25 are
 
05:12:13.070 --> 05:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
the same I misunderstood something being
 
05:12:15.770 --> 05:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
said could you clarify well I I think I
 
05:12:17.750 --> 05:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
said it but I probably didn't say it
 
05:12:21.050 --> 05:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
very well I I pointed out just as you
 
05:12:25.610 --> 05:12:25.620 align:start position:0%
observed that uh the Cur the next budget
 
05:12:29.270 --> 05:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
keeps the dollar amounts the same as the
 
05:12:31.490 --> 05:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
second year of the current budget so
 
05:12:34.150 --> 05:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
there's no increased money
 
05:12:37.128 --> 05:12:37.138 align:start position:0%
and initially when we figured out how
 
05:12:38.930 --> 05:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
much money to put we used the two
 
05:12:41.810 --> 05:12:41.820 align:start position:0%
percent number but because this is a
 
05:12:44.208 --> 05:12:44.218 align:start position:0%
second budget and the money hasn't moved
 
05:12:46.788 --> 05:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's really not the two percent
 
05:12:46.798 --> 05:12:48.670 align:start position:0%
it's it's really not the two percent
anymore

05:12:48.670 --> 05:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
05:12:52.010 --> 05:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
yeah no problem I'm sure I could have
 
05:12:53.930 --> 05:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
been more clear
 
05:12:53.940 --> 05:12:55.850 align:start position:0%
been more clear
okay

05:12:55.850 --> 05:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:12:58.730 --> 05:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
we're on 15.
 
05:13:03.708 --> 05:13:03.718 align:start position:0%
okay so 15 is the is you know back to
 
05:13:06.770 --> 05:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
your point uh uh representative grassy
 
05:13:08.810 --> 05:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
you know how how can we be more
 
05:13:10.750 --> 05:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
efficient how can we be more productive
 
05:13:14.628 --> 05:13:14.638 align:start position:0%
well uh what the the department believes
 
05:13:16.910 --> 05:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
is part of the answer to that is to
 
05:13:21.650 --> 05:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
continuing to uh to maintain and operate
 
05:13:24.948 --> 05:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
and upgrade the the Medicaid management
 
05:13:28.070 --> 05:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
information system now this item
 
05:13:33.070 --> 05:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
initially found its way in hb2 uh and so
 
05:13:36.350 --> 05:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
that that really wasn't the right place
 
05:13:40.788 --> 05:13:40.798 align:start position:0%
to put it because uh the dollar amount
 
05:13:44.810 --> 05:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
was so big that I had assumed in the
 
05:13:47.810 --> 05:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
previous budget that this was one-time
 
05:13:51.230 --> 05:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
upgrade money and not an ongoing annual
 
05:13:55.070 --> 05:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
operations cost and I was the full last
 
05:13:57.590 --> 05:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
budget that said don't take this one
 
05:14:00.530 --> 05:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
time upgrade money and put it into HP
 
05:14:03.708 --> 05:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
one put it into hb2 and so they did what
 
05:14:06.110 --> 05:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
I asked and this year when I was looking
 
05:14:07.850 --> 05:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
at it and talking more about it it
 
05:14:10.250 --> 05:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
became clear that this is just an
 
05:14:12.350 --> 05:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
incredibly expensive operations and
 
05:14:14.930 --> 05:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
maintenance and it belongs into hb1 so
 
05:14:18.530 --> 05:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
so we moved it from hb2 to hb1 and in
 
05:14:21.050 --> 05:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
order to fund it we used some FY 23
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
carryover money and you'll see the
 
05:14:27.530 --> 05:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
detail on that on page one row 9 and 10
 
05:14:31.750 --> 05:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
of the bigger Longer sheet
 
05:14:35.150 --> 05:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
so now we're going to go to page 16. now
 
05:14:39.230 --> 05:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
this is another to your your point of
 
05:14:42.430 --> 05:14:42.440 align:start position:0%
how do we gain the productivity uh at
 
05:14:46.910 --> 05:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS we're the new heights system is the
 
05:14:49.190 --> 05:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
name of the integrated eligibility
 
05:14:53.628 --> 05:14:53.638 align:start position:0%
system and so this is uh an audit of
 
05:14:56.448 --> 05:14:56.458 align:start position:0%
that system to you know make sure that
 
05:14:58.368 --> 05:14:58.378 align:start position:0%
it's complying with our requirements I
 
05:15:01.010 --> 05:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
hope they're also looking at the
 
05:15:02.390 --> 05:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
workflow to make sure that it's
 
05:15:04.490 --> 05:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
efficient but anyways it's at least a
 
05:15:07.070 --> 05:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
compliance audit we moved it it moved
 
05:15:09.650 --> 05:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
this money instead of being FY 23
 
05:15:14.288 --> 05:15:14.298 align:start position:0%
carryover we just funded it in FY 24.
 
05:15:18.070 --> 05:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
then we're on page 17.
 
05:15:23.580 --> 05:15:23.590 align:start position:0%
I would like to give
 
05:15:23.590 --> 05:15:24.830 align:start position:0%
I would like to give
[Music]

05:15:24.830 --> 05:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:15:26.868 --> 05:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
am I is this the one I'm supposed to do
 
05:15:31.368 --> 05:15:31.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:36.590 --> 05:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
no not yet uh this this was
 
05:15:38.208 --> 05:15:38.218 align:start position:0%
um okay there's something called
 
05:15:39.770 --> 05:15:39.780 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort
 
05:15:42.530 --> 05:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort is sort of uh if
 
05:15:44.090 --> 05:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
you're playing poker it's kind of your
 
05:15:46.550 --> 05:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
minimum anti or your minimum bid to even
 
05:15:49.250 --> 05:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
get into the game with the feds in order
 
05:15:50.990 --> 05:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
to get their Federal money we have to
 
05:15:54.288 --> 05:15:54.298 align:start position:0%
meet a maintenance of effort level
 
05:15:56.510 --> 05:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
um and if you take a look at the
 
05:16:00.288 --> 05:16:00.298 align:start position:0%
programs where we have active expenses
 
05:16:02.628 --> 05:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
associated with it if you take all the
 
05:16:04.190 --> 05:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
general funds that we're planning to
 
05:16:08.330 --> 05:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
spend in hb1 on on the TANF towards the
 
05:16:11.628 --> 05:16:11.638 align:start position:0%
TANF where there's still a gap to our
 
05:16:16.030 --> 05:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
minimum level of effort and so hb2
 
05:16:19.128 --> 05:16:19.138 align:start position:0%
housed an extra three million dollars a
 
05:16:21.708 --> 05:16:21.718 align:start position:0%
year so that we could make our minimum
 
05:16:24.170 --> 05:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
level of effort and and what that did
 
05:16:26.930 --> 05:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
for us is it bought us insurance so that
 
05:16:29.150 --> 05:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
next time they calculate TANF they don't
 
05:16:31.070 --> 05:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
penalize us and we get all the federal
 
05:16:33.230 --> 05:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
money that we're eligible for
 
05:16:35.330 --> 05:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
so looking at that three million dollars
 
05:16:37.368 --> 05:16:37.378 align:start position:0%
a year we went back knowing that this
 
05:16:39.470 --> 05:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
the estimate was six seven eight months
 
05:16:41.628 --> 05:16:41.638 align:start position:0%
old and asked the department and this is
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
an example of Mr White stepping up for
 
05:16:46.730 --> 05:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
us we asked them to do a new analysis to
 
05:16:48.410 --> 05:16:48.420 align:start position:0%
see if the 3 million a year was still
 
05:16:51.470 --> 05:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
the best estimate and he came back and
 
05:16:54.350 --> 05:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
said that the department could be
 
05:16:56.690 --> 05:16:56.700 align:start position:0%
comfortable with a 2.5 million dollar a
 
05:16:58.368 --> 05:16:58.378 align:start position:0%
year amount so that that ended up
 
05:17:01.550 --> 05:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
freeing a million dollars over the
 
05:17:04.730 --> 05:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
um uh the biennium and you'll only see
 
05:17:07.670 --> 05:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
this into hb2 but so that saves a little
 
05:17:12.550 --> 05:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:15.170 --> 05:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:17:17.628 --> 05:17:17.638 align:start position:0%
when you add money to an area like this
 
05:17:21.650 --> 05:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
does it somehow change the eligibility
 
05:17:23.990 --> 05:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
requirements so so more people get money
 
05:17:26.270 --> 05:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
or or the amount of money they receive
 
05:17:28.910 --> 05:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
gets up a little higher how does
 
05:17:31.010 --> 05:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
how does this money get spent so that we
 
05:17:33.288 --> 05:17:33.298 align:start position:0%
meet the maintenance of effort this this
 
05:17:35.750 --> 05:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
amendment does not change the
 
05:17:38.810 --> 05:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates for the TANF
 
05:17:41.330 --> 05:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
eligible program but it does make money
 
05:17:43.788 --> 05:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
available if there's greater levels of
 
05:17:43.798 --> 05:17:47.590 align:start position:0%
available if there's greater levels of
utilization

05:17:47.590 --> 05:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:51.948 --> 05:17:51.958 align:start position:0%
so so if if there wasn't the demand for
 
05:17:55.250 --> 05:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
this would we would we not meet
 
05:17:58.250 --> 05:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort or do you see what
 
05:18:01.788 --> 05:18:01.798 align:start position:0%
I mean yes the answer to that is this is
 
05:18:03.530 --> 05:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
the guarantee that we're going to make
 
05:18:05.570 --> 05:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
the minimum payments necessary to
 
05:18:07.550 --> 05:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
achieve the minimum uh the maintenance
 
05:18:10.128 --> 05:18:10.138 align:start position:0%
of effort because failing to meet the
 
05:18:12.550 --> 05:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
Min the maintenance of effort levels
 
05:18:16.550 --> 05:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
causes substantial enough penalties and
 
05:18:19.788 --> 05:18:19.798 align:start position:0%
a reduction in next budgets uh TANF
 
05:18:22.368 --> 05:18:22.378 align:start position:0%
funding that we don't want that negative
 
05:18:24.948 --> 05:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
event to happen so this is this is extra
 
05:18:26.448 --> 05:18:26.458 align:start position:0%
money it's sort of like an insurance
 
05:18:29.750 --> 05:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
policy do you want to add more to that
 
05:18:32.390 --> 05:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
let me speak to that
 
05:18:34.550 --> 05:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
um basically the need wasn't there we
 
05:18:36.350 --> 05:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need the money the need is
 
05:18:38.150 --> 05:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
there this is just make sure that we
 
05:18:40.128 --> 05:18:40.138 align:start position:0%
have the money in general funds just in
 
05:18:42.470 --> 05:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
case we need more General funds to match
 
05:18:43.670 --> 05:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
what we're going to bring them down so
 
05:18:45.708 --> 05:18:45.718 align:start position:0%
the need is there otherwise we wouldn't
 
05:18:47.810 --> 05:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
care about the federal dollars this is
 
05:18:49.368 --> 05:18:49.378 align:start position:0%
welfare this is the temporary assistance
 
05:18:51.288 --> 05:18:51.298 align:start position:0%
in needy families
 
05:18:53.868 --> 05:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
and in a bit we're gonna I
 
05:18:56.510 --> 05:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
affectionately refer to them as the uh
 
05:18:59.090 --> 05:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
the representative Waller amendments
 
05:19:01.310 --> 05:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
where we spend more TANF money so she's
 
05:19:03.650 --> 05:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
helping us spend all the money we can
 
05:19:07.368 --> 05:19:07.378 align:start position:0%
put into the Tana funds so but we all
 
05:19:07.378 --> 05:19:08.510 align:start position:0%
put into the Tana funds so but we all
agreed

05:19:08.510 --> 05:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
05:19:12.890 --> 05:19:12.900 align:start position:0%
okay so page 18.
 
05:19:17.628 --> 05:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
are there other questions no page 18 uh
 
05:19:20.628 --> 05:19:20.638 align:start position:0%
this was a deletion of the Family
 
05:19:23.150 --> 05:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
Resource Center funding of one million
 
05:19:27.350 --> 05:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
dollars a year it wasn't that this is
 
05:19:30.590 --> 05:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
not a good program it I wasn't clear
 
05:19:33.230 --> 05:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
that there were adequate metrics to
 
05:19:35.090 --> 05:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
measure exactly what these guys were
 
05:19:37.368 --> 05:19:37.378 align:start position:0%
going to do for that extra million
 
05:19:40.070 --> 05:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
dollars a year so we scraped it and we
 
05:19:42.128 --> 05:19:42.138 align:start position:0%
put the 2 million over the biennium
 
05:19:44.770 --> 05:19:44.780 align:start position:0%
towards Medicaid
 
05:19:48.590 --> 05:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:52.970 --> 05:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
Pages 19 through 21
 
05:19:56.930 --> 05:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
okay so this is actually where I think
 
05:19:59.510 --> 05:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
um the department did some really good
 
05:20:03.288 --> 05:20:03.298 align:start position:0%
work together with in division three uh
 
05:20:05.990 --> 05:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and a lot of people contributed
 
05:20:09.050 --> 05:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
to it now now I think it's really good
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
work another point of view is it's not
 
05:20:12.708 --> 05:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
very good work because we didn't put
 
05:20:15.350 --> 05:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
enough money into it but so other than
 
05:20:17.810 --> 05:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount we did some good work
 
05:20:22.610 --> 05:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
what what we did was uh we listened to
 
05:20:24.590 --> 05:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
the governor we listened to the
 
05:20:27.230 --> 05:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
community and we were told that we ought
 
05:20:29.810 --> 05:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
to increase the Medicaid reimbursement
 
05:20:29.820 --> 05:20:30.910 align:start position:0%
to increase the Medicaid reimbursement
rates

05:20:30.910 --> 05:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
rates
 
05:20:34.490 --> 05:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
and we agreed with them we needed to do
 
05:20:36.770 --> 05:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
that above the 3.1 percent that the
 
05:20:39.708 --> 05:20:39.718 align:start position:0%
governor had requested and so then the
 
05:20:41.510 --> 05:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
question is if you're going to increase
 
05:20:44.208 --> 05:20:44.218 align:start position:0%
the rates which rates are you going to
 
05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
increase and by how much
 
05:20:49.570 --> 05:20:49.580 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh answers that question
 
05:20:52.490 --> 05:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
if you look at it just the major
 
05:20:56.810 --> 05:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
sections of it or on between lines 5
 
05:21:00.530 --> 05:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
through 14 at 12 million a year that you
 
05:21:02.270 --> 05:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
see there
 
05:21:05.270 --> 05:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
keeps the governor's promise to give 3.1
 
05:21:08.810 --> 05:21:08.820 align:start position:0%
percent across the board to everyone
 
05:21:11.390 --> 05:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that was surprising to
 
05:21:13.490 --> 05:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
me was when the hospital Association
 
05:21:16.128 --> 05:21:16.138 align:start position:0%
stepped forward and said
 
05:21:19.788 --> 05:21:19.798 align:start position:0%
don't give us our share of the 3.1
 
05:21:19.798 --> 05:21:21.050 align:start position:0%
don't give us our share of the 3.1
percent

05:21:21.050 --> 05:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:21:23.510 --> 05:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
that was five million dollars a year had
 
05:21:27.890 --> 05:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
we kept that 3.1 percent promise to the
 
05:21:30.170 --> 05:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
hospitals instead of 12 million a year
 
05:21:32.330 --> 05:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
this would have been 17 million a year
 
05:21:34.970 --> 05:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
what that did was that freed up that 10
 
05:21:37.628 --> 05:21:37.638 align:start position:0%
million dollars plus the other
 
05:21:41.150 --> 05:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
funds that we were getting from saving
 
05:21:43.430 --> 05:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
some money on some other programs to
 
05:21:46.128 --> 05:21:46.138 align:start position:0%
spend across the board across all the
 
05:21:46.138 --> 05:21:47.410 align:start position:0%
spend across the board across all the
Medicaid

05:21:47.410 --> 05:21:47.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
05:21:49.910 --> 05:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
service providers
 
05:21:53.690 --> 05:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
and we did that based on the work of the
 
05:21:56.090 --> 05:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
community they came to us with a
 
05:21:59.090 --> 05:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet of all the services and said
 
05:22:01.490 --> 05:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
in order for us to basically
 
05:22:03.470 --> 05:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
stay in business for the next couple of
 
05:22:05.810 --> 05:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
years we really have to have sort of
 
05:22:09.050 --> 05:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
this minimum amount of rate increase to
 
05:22:11.390 --> 05:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
help us get through the next two years
 
05:22:14.690 --> 05:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
so again unlimited wants and limited
 
05:22:17.330 --> 05:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
resources we didn't have all the
 
05:22:19.128 --> 05:22:19.138 align:start position:0%
resources to fully fund the community
 
05:22:23.448 --> 05:22:23.458 align:start position:0%
request but we use their their format
 
05:22:26.810 --> 05:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
and we used some of the information we
 
05:22:28.550 --> 05:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
got from them so that we could allocate
 
05:22:30.830 --> 05:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
what we could where we could with the
 
05:22:35.230 --> 05:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
priority of solving the ER boarding
 
05:22:39.590 --> 05:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:42.050 --> 05:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
so I think this is good work
 
05:22:44.810 --> 05:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
um because it establishes a framework
 
05:22:46.550 --> 05:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
that had never existed that the
 
05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
executive branch did I yeah I will but
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
it established a framework on exactly uh
 
05:22:58.730 --> 05:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
a a methodology to uh allow the Senate
 
05:23:00.288 --> 05:23:00.298 align:start position:0%
if they have a different amount of money
 
05:23:03.470 --> 05:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
to invest this gives them a road map on
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
how to do that in a way that really will
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
address the community needs thanks that
 
05:23:10.250 --> 05:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
was the point I wanted to make
 
05:23:12.110 --> 05:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you and that
 
05:23:14.390 --> 05:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
was a point I needed to hear as well
 
05:23:14.400 --> 05:23:15.110 align:start position:0%
was a point I needed to hear as well
um

05:23:15.110 --> 05:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:17.090 --> 05:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
at the public hearing this is this is
 
05:23:19.610 --> 05:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
the area that we heard loud and clear
 
05:23:22.010 --> 05:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
from so many
 
05:23:24.650 --> 05:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
um out in my community I hear it all the
 
05:23:27.650 --> 05:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
time I hear it at the automatic meetings
 
05:23:28.850 --> 05:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
05:23:28.860 --> 05:23:30.050 align:start position:0%
that we have
now

05:23:30.050 --> 05:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:23:34.430 --> 05:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
what your defining for us
 
05:23:38.110 --> 05:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
um this approach that you're taking will
 
05:23:42.530 --> 05:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
mitigate to some extent the need to
 
05:23:45.170 --> 05:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
raise the Medicaid rates but not to the
 
05:23:47.510 --> 05:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
extent to which you'd like to so what
 
05:23:50.090 --> 05:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
you've what I think I'm hearing is that
 
05:23:52.610 --> 05:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
you're saying that you believe you CR
 
05:23:56.390 --> 05:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
you've created a path to the Senate so
 
05:23:59.628 --> 05:23:59.638 align:start position:0%
that the Senate then can pick up
 
05:24:02.930 --> 05:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
and if they have additional funds can
 
05:24:04.970 --> 05:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
further the work that you've started is
 
05:24:06.470 --> 05:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
that what I heard
 
05:24:09.288 --> 05:24:09.298 align:start position:0%
I I think you you could have heard it
 
05:24:11.390 --> 05:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
that way I I would say it slightly
 
05:24:13.730 --> 05:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
differently that it is a is it's an
 
05:24:16.730 --> 05:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
establishment of a framework that can be
 
05:24:18.830 --> 05:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
used by the Senate if they have less
 
05:24:18.840 --> 05:24:20.090 align:start position:0%
used by the Senate if they have less
money

05:24:20.090 --> 05:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:24:22.190 --> 05:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
they can use this methodology to figure
 
05:24:24.470 --> 05:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
out where to pull money out if they have
 
05:24:26.090 --> 05:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
more money they can use the same
 
05:24:28.610 --> 05:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
framework to put money in it's a kind of
 
05:24:31.250 --> 05:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
a bi-directional framework if you would
 
05:24:34.190 --> 05:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
now to give you some order of magnitude
 
05:24:36.770 --> 05:24:36.780 align:start position:0%
on what the blue team and the red team
 
05:24:42.110 --> 05:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
were thinking this money is uh um it's
 
05:24:44.570 --> 05:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
it's 24 million for the two years for
 
05:24:46.670 --> 05:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
the 3.1 percent minus the hospital
 
05:24:46.680 --> 05:24:48.368 align:start position:0%
the 3.1 percent minus the hospital
request

05:24:48.368 --> 05:24:48.378 align:start position:0%
request
 
05:24:48.378 --> 05:24:49.990 align:start position:0%
request
plus

05:24:49.990 --> 05:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
plus
 
05:24:53.208 --> 05:24:53.218 align:start position:0%
70.2 million dollars added that the
 
05:24:56.270 --> 05:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
governor did not so we added 70.2
 
05:24:58.850 --> 05:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
million dollars that that's that's a
 
05:25:01.070 --> 05:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
nice chunk of change
 
05:25:05.570 --> 05:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
um what was I I think the ballpark that
 
05:25:07.310 --> 05:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
um our our friends across the aisle
 
05:25:09.350 --> 05:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
wanted in the division was on the order
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
200 million or or maybe a little more I
 
05:25:13.490 --> 05:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
don't know but they can speak for
 
05:25:16.070 --> 05:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
themselves but be somewhere between 70
 
05:25:20.570 --> 05:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
and 200 million is the the different of
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
opinion and when you look at 130 million
 
05:25:26.390 --> 05:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
dollar difference of opinion and you go
 
05:25:28.250 --> 05:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
back and you look at these some of these
 
05:25:30.230 --> 05:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
little players in here that help
 
05:25:34.128 --> 05:25:34.138 align:start position:0%
contribute to to our our bill payers it
 
05:25:36.650 --> 05:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
it it's not it's not a whole lot of
 
05:25:37.730 --> 05:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
money and we're putting it into
 
05:25:39.230 --> 05:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
something that I think is going to be
 
05:25:41.090 --> 05:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
critical to the state in the next two
 
05:25:41.100 --> 05:25:43.430 align:start position:0%
critical to the state in the next two
years

05:25:43.430 --> 05:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:45.470 --> 05:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead and representative Mooney you
 
05:25:47.628 --> 05:25:47.638 align:start position:0%
had a comment thank you Mr chair and
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to add to
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
that that with regards to this amendment
 
05:25:53.570 --> 05:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
as a member of division three I'm quite
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
proud that we formatted it like this and
 
05:25:58.670 --> 05:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
I want to give a special shout out to
 
05:26:00.650 --> 05:26:00.660 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham who introduced
 
05:26:03.650 --> 05:26:03.660 align:start position:0%
this format never before has this been
 
05:26:07.430 --> 05:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
laid out so clear and so specific as it
 
05:26:09.530 --> 05:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
does in this amendment so representative
 
05:26:11.750 --> 05:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
Stringham did fantastic work with his
 
05:26:13.850 --> 05:26:13.860 align:start position:0%
team in terms of getting us this format
 
05:26:16.550 --> 05:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
that we could work off of thank you
 
05:26:19.250 --> 05:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
well in representative verf and
 
05:26:23.208 --> 05:26:23.218 align:start position:0%
representative hole then used a very
 
05:26:26.090 --> 05:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
similar format and and and came up with
 
05:26:27.530 --> 05:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
different numbers in a way in which
 
05:26:29.270 --> 05:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
there's a methodology that can be
 
05:26:31.490 --> 05:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
explained an algorithm to allocate money
 
05:26:33.708 --> 05:26:33.718 align:start position:0%
that if you change out the amount that
 
05:26:36.050 --> 05:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
to put in the algorithm will generate
 
05:26:38.570 --> 05:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
the money invested so it I I don't know
 
05:26:41.628 --> 05:26:41.638 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's good work for a group
 
05:26:45.490 --> 05:26:45.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:48.948 --> 05:26:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:51.530 --> 05:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
so what this represents what we're
 
05:26:54.770 --> 05:26:54.780 align:start position:0%
looking at here is that about half
 
05:26:56.810 --> 05:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
of what um
 
05:27:00.650 --> 05:27:00.660 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid providers said they felt
 
05:27:01.730 --> 05:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
they needed
 
05:27:04.550 --> 05:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
because this all most of this amendment
 
05:27:07.970 --> 05:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
really came from the work of the
 
05:27:10.190 --> 05:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
provider Community as a coalition they
 
05:27:12.050 --> 05:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
got together
 
05:27:14.390 --> 05:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
um they had a number of some providers
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
needed a percentage increase some
 
05:27:20.448 --> 05:27:20.458 align:start position:0%
providers needed a daily rate income I
 
05:27:24.110 --> 05:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
mean it was it was a variety of ways
 
05:27:26.750 --> 05:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
that they needed to be reimbursed and
 
05:27:29.868 --> 05:27:29.878 align:start position:0%
these are really providers who as you
 
05:27:32.690 --> 05:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
heard of the at the hearing they're very
 
05:27:36.830 --> 05:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
fragile they are really some of them are
 
05:27:40.128 --> 05:27:40.138 align:start position:0%
if we lose them it will be debt very
 
05:27:42.350 --> 05:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
detrimental to New Hampshire
 
05:27:44.750 --> 05:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
I mean the the people who do the
 
05:27:44.760 --> 05:27:45.490 align:start position:0%
I mean the the people who do the
community

05:27:45.490 --> 05:27:45.500 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:27:49.368 --> 05:27:49.378 align:start position:0%
work with families where if an elderly
 
05:27:51.410 --> 05:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
family member stays at home instead of
 
05:27:53.750 --> 05:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
going into the nursing home they can do
 
05:27:55.850 --> 05:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
that work for
 
05:27:58.128 --> 05:27:58.138 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars a year to keep
 
05:28:00.410 --> 05:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
someone in their own home on an average
 
05:28:02.448 --> 05:28:02.458 align:start position:0%
whereas if they go into a nursing home
 
05:28:05.448 --> 05:28:05.458 align:start position:0%
it's closer to hundreds of thousands of
 
05:28:05.458 --> 05:28:06.288 align:start position:0%
it's closer to hundreds of thousands of
dollars

05:28:06.288 --> 05:28:06.298 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:28:06.298 --> 05:28:07.610 align:start position:0%
dollars
so

05:28:07.610 --> 05:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:28:10.070 --> 05:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
these are the providers that really we
 
05:28:12.288 --> 05:28:12.298 align:start position:0%
really need to be sure they're in good
 
05:28:16.310 --> 05:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
shape this is half of what they told us
 
05:28:19.850 --> 05:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
they need we've had 14 percent inflation
 
05:28:21.948 --> 05:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of years they
 
05:28:24.170 --> 05:28:24.180 align:start position:0%
haven't had a rate increase since two
 
05:28:26.750 --> 05:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
years ago and some of the providers
 
05:28:28.910 --> 05:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
hadn't had a rate increase for many
 
05:28:32.628 --> 05:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
years before that so these providers are
 
05:28:35.330 --> 05:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
really really this they are our safety
 
05:28:40.128 --> 05:28:40.138 align:start position:0%
net to keep people out of nursing homes
 
05:28:42.050 --> 05:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
05:28:45.830 --> 05:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
in higher end services and this is
 
05:28:50.030 --> 05:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
really where we need to focus and I
 
05:28:50.040 --> 05:28:51.230 align:start position:0%
really where we need to focus and I
think

05:28:51.230 --> 05:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:28:52.970 --> 05:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
providing them with
 
05:28:55.730 --> 05:28:55.740 align:start position:0%
let a lot less than they need providing
 
05:28:57.410 --> 05:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
them with fifty percent less than they
 
05:28:59.270 --> 05:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
feel like they need
 
05:28:59.280 --> 05:29:00.708 align:start position:0%
feel like they need
um

05:29:00.708 --> 05:29:00.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:03.350 --> 05:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
could end up being a real problem for
 
05:29:06.110 --> 05:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
the state and for thousands of people
 
05:29:07.850 --> 05:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
that they serve
 
05:29:10.670 --> 05:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
to so if I could I agree with everything
 
05:29:13.490 --> 05:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
but the last sentence or two of what by
 
05:29:16.070 --> 05:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
the representative just said and I I
 
05:29:18.530 --> 05:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
what I what I have attempted to say is
 
05:29:21.890 --> 05:29:21.900 align:start position:0%
we have a framework with an algorithm if
 
05:29:24.230 --> 05:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
we had more money we could put it in
 
05:29:27.170 --> 05:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
there and it'd just be a math problem uh
 
05:29:29.990 --> 05:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
so so not knowing how much money we
 
05:29:32.690 --> 05:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
would have as a finance committee we we
 
05:29:34.910 --> 05:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
took a best shot at keeping division
 
05:29:38.330 --> 05:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
three within some guard rails so that we
 
05:29:41.690 --> 05:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
could come to an event like this and and
 
05:29:43.730 --> 05:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
if there were extra money I I'd
 
05:29:45.470 --> 05:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
certainly be open to putting it into
 
05:29:47.390 --> 05:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
this program but
 
05:29:49.788 --> 05:29:49.798 align:start position:0%
um so that's where we're at
 
05:29:55.330 --> 05:29:55.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:58.190 --> 05:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
94.2 million on our side and and maybe
 
05:30:02.510 --> 05:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
you know 20 224 on the other any number
 
05:30:06.650 --> 05:30:06.660 align:start position:0%
in between there is you know a number
 
05:30:06.660 --> 05:30:09.230 align:start position:0%
in between there is you know a number
representative

05:30:09.230 --> 05:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:30:11.930 --> 05:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
no just that my seat mate here
 
05:30:14.448 --> 05:30:14.458 align:start position:0%
was informing me of how much nursing
 
05:30:16.910 --> 05:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
home care cost and
 
05:30:16.920 --> 05:30:19.030 align:start position:0%
home care cost and
um

05:30:19.030 --> 05:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:21.770 --> 05:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
yeah well we found out on our Merrimack
 
05:30:23.930 --> 05:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
County budget it's it's something like
 
05:30:26.288 --> 05:30:26.298 align:start position:0%
400 000
 
05:30:29.330 --> 05:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
a resident for our Merrimack County home
 
05:30:31.910 --> 05:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
I mean it's just an absolute incredible
 
05:30:36.288 --> 05:30:36.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:39.110 --> 05:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
okay represent Sweeney for a question
 
05:30:40.610 --> 05:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman thank
 
05:30:41.868 --> 05:30:41.878 align:start position:0%
you to the chair and vice chair division
 
05:30:43.730 --> 05:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
three this is actually a genuine
 
05:30:45.050 --> 05:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
question that I do not know the answer
 
05:30:45.060 --> 05:30:46.310 align:start position:0%
question that I do not know the answer
to

05:30:46.310 --> 05:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:30:48.590 --> 05:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
um providers that are benefiting from
 
05:30:50.510 --> 05:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
this the Medicaid rate reimbursement
 
05:30:52.730 --> 05:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
schedule the program especially the the
 
05:30:54.650 --> 05:30:54.660 align:start position:0%
new one that's been laid out in this
 
05:30:56.330 --> 05:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
amendment to hp2
 
05:30:58.390 --> 05:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
are they allowed
 
05:31:01.550 --> 05:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
individually as individual units or
 
05:31:04.788 --> 05:31:04.798 align:start position:0%
groups to go to the fiscal committee or
 
05:31:07.670 --> 05:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
to the executive Council to get funding
 
05:31:10.730 --> 05:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
after the budget is adopted in a
 
05:31:13.430 --> 05:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
emergency need basis is that an
 
05:31:16.430 --> 05:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
allowable application or are they
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
what we do in the budget is is they're
 
05:31:20.810 --> 05:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
locked in for two years okay so
 
05:31:23.150 --> 05:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
generally as I understand it uh people
 
05:31:25.128 --> 05:31:25.138 align:start position:0%
can go to the fiscal committee under two
 
05:31:28.250 --> 05:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
scenarios uh and and in both scenarios
 
05:31:31.190 --> 05:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's a it's the state doing it in
 
05:31:33.890 --> 05:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
scenario one uh there's Federal funding
 
05:31:35.930 --> 05:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
funding that's been made available and
 
05:31:37.788 --> 05:31:37.798 align:start position:0%
we have to take a look at the guidelines
 
05:31:39.530 --> 05:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
and the money and figure out if that's
 
05:31:41.448 --> 05:31:41.458 align:start position:0%
consistent with the programs we want to
 
05:31:44.150 --> 05:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
run then the other is when the
 
05:31:45.948 --> 05:31:45.958 align:start position:0%
department will come to us and say
 
05:31:48.708 --> 05:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
there's a transfer that I need to do
 
05:31:51.470 --> 05:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
that exceeds the The Authority that I
 
05:31:53.990 --> 05:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
already have so and both in those
 
05:31:56.930 --> 05:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
instances it's the state your question
 
05:31:59.510 --> 05:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
is can the providers come to us to ask
 
05:32:01.910 --> 05:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
for more money they can certainly no not
 
05:32:03.410 --> 05:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal committee but they
 
05:32:06.470 --> 05:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
can go to you know Mr lippman in the
 
05:32:08.628 --> 05:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
department say hey you got to help us
 
05:32:11.270 --> 05:32:11.280 align:start position:0%
and you know maybe depending on the
 
05:32:13.850 --> 05:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
flexibility we've given them we may be
 
05:32:15.410 --> 05:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
able to do something in the next
 
05:32:18.770 --> 05:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
Amendment so cycle of the MCO contracts
 
05:32:21.410 --> 05:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
to to get the money to them but through
 
05:32:26.650 --> 05:32:26.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:29.390 --> 05:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham yeah and just
 
05:32:31.310 --> 05:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of of the numbers that the
 
05:32:34.850 --> 05:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
process uh revealed that revealed
 
05:32:37.310 --> 05:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
um uh you know the first year we we
 
05:32:39.050 --> 05:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
figured on average it would take about a
 
05:32:42.110 --> 05:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
quarter to update any Medicaid rates so
 
05:32:45.350 --> 05:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid uh rate increases actually
 
05:32:47.810 --> 05:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
or three quarters the first year the
 
05:32:49.970 --> 05:32:49.980 align:start position:0%
second uh as there would be the second
 
05:32:54.350 --> 05:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
year of the biennium and uh so uh the
 
05:32:56.990 --> 05:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
total numbers came out to about 175
 
05:33:00.410 --> 05:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
million or you know maybe uh 80 million
 
05:33:03.650 --> 05:33:03.660 align:start position:0%
or so 85 million over uh what came out
 
05:33:06.170 --> 05:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
of of our department
 
05:33:09.650 --> 05:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh this is probably even even with the
 
05:33:12.708 --> 05:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
hospitals kicking in their piece uh this
 
05:33:14.990 --> 05:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
isn't keeping up even with inflation and
 
05:33:17.510 --> 05:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
there was already terrific provider
 
05:33:20.390 --> 05:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
shortages on certain areas you know if
 
05:33:22.310 --> 05:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
you can't hire somebody to come in and
 
05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
take care of somebody for twelve dollars
 
05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
an hour and that's the rate uh it you
 
05:33:30.770 --> 05:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
know the rate the rate uh is the work
 
05:33:33.050 --> 05:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
isn't going to get done unless unless
 
05:33:36.288 --> 05:33:36.298 align:start position:0%
it's by relative or something else so
 
05:33:39.350 --> 05:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the hard work that was
 
05:33:41.750 --> 05:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
done and the prioritization on all these
 
05:33:45.890 --> 05:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh but it is still as uh representative
 
05:33:49.190 --> 05:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
Edwards indicated uh probably not enough
 
05:33:52.368 --> 05:33:52.378 align:start position:0%
to keep keep the system from
 
05:33:54.530 --> 05:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
um further degrading rather than getting
 
05:33:58.368 --> 05:33:58.378 align:start position:0%
close to being back on track thank you
 
05:34:01.730 --> 05:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
I I I'd agree with everything you said I
 
05:34:04.070 --> 05:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
I just would point out that that this
 
05:34:06.410 --> 05:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
amendment at least does 60 million more
 
05:34:09.410 --> 05:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
than the governor proposed so
 
05:34:12.530 --> 05:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
uh so I don't think any division created
 
05:34:15.170 --> 05:34:15.180 align:start position:0%
their own 60 million dollar expenditure
 
05:34:17.930 --> 05:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh division three did that yeah
 
05:34:21.230 --> 05:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
so uh should I go on Mr chair
 
05:34:21.240 --> 05:34:22.610 align:start position:0%
so uh should I go on Mr chair
okay

05:34:22.610 --> 05:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:34:22.620 --> 05:34:23.208 align:start position:0%
okay
um

05:34:23.208 --> 05:34:23.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:26.810 --> 05:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
so page 22.
 
05:34:26.820 --> 05:34:27.410 align:start position:0%
so page 22.
um

05:34:27.410 --> 05:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:32.030 --> 05:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
we uh okay the governor and we agree
 
05:34:34.368 --> 05:34:34.378 align:start position:0%
that we have an issue with not enough
 
05:34:37.208 --> 05:34:37.218 align:start position:0%
beds to discharge people out of the ERS
 
05:34:40.970 --> 05:34:40.980 align:start position:0%
into some sort of a follow-on care we
 
05:34:45.470 --> 05:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
agree to that so he had three hb2 items
 
05:34:48.128 --> 05:34:48.138 align:start position:0%
that essentially created
 
05:34:50.510 --> 05:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use the term unfunded
 
05:34:52.850 --> 05:34:52.860 align:start position:0%
mandate because although it's not the
 
05:34:54.530 --> 05:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
correct constitutional term in this
 
05:34:57.170 --> 05:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
context it's the same concept and that
 
05:35:01.750 --> 05:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
is that he was directing
 
05:35:05.930 --> 05:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
percentages of of beds that needed to be
 
05:35:08.868 --> 05:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
built or numbers of beds rather that
 
05:35:13.730 --> 05:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
needed to be built as a drf designated
 
05:35:17.690 --> 05:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
receiving facilities and we we weren't
 
05:35:20.330 --> 05:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
giving them any money to do it we were
 
05:35:22.550 --> 05:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
telling them to the hospitals to do it
 
05:35:24.410 --> 05:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
anyways even though we know they have
 
05:35:26.750 --> 05:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortages and in order to
 
05:35:29.448 --> 05:35:29.458 align:start position:0%
staff a bed they have to take staff from
 
05:35:31.368 --> 05:35:31.378 align:start position:0%
somebody else somewhere else and put it
 
05:35:34.610 --> 05:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
into the drf and and and that's all
 
05:35:37.250 --> 05:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
being done in a way in which it's a
 
05:35:39.890 --> 05:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
top-down command driven uh government
 
05:35:43.788 --> 05:35:43.798 align:start position:0%
edict and so it just didn't seem like
 
05:35:46.788 --> 05:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
the right way to build the capacity that
 
05:35:49.070 --> 05:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
is really needed out there we agree on
 
05:35:51.650 --> 05:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
the goal certainly didn't agree on the
 
05:35:51.660 --> 05:35:53.390 align:start position:0%
the goal certainly didn't agree on the
technique

05:35:53.390 --> 05:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
technique
 
05:35:57.530 --> 05:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
so we struck those three requests
 
05:36:01.990 --> 05:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
um item or page 23
 
05:36:04.628 --> 05:36:04.638 align:start position:0%
this is uh the first of two
 
05:36:06.610 --> 05:36:06.620 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
05:36:09.910 --> 05:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
amendments this was a good one
 
05:36:12.948 --> 05:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
she recognized that there we have a
 
05:36:15.350 --> 05:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
federal reserve of TANF money it's
 
05:36:19.610 --> 05:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
approximately 67 million so she she I
 
05:36:22.070 --> 05:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
didn't she identified that she said can
 
05:36:25.190 --> 05:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
we can we go ahead and have some of that
 
05:36:27.948 --> 05:36:27.958 align:start position:0%
TANF money fund unemployment related
 
05:36:29.830 --> 05:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
child care services
 
05:36:32.208 --> 05:36:32.218 align:start position:0%
which are vital to rebuilding the
 
05:36:35.990 --> 05:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
workforce and to avoid a wait list so
 
05:36:37.970 --> 05:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
was this the one that was seven million
 
05:36:41.000 --> 05:36:41.010 align:start position:0%
or 2.4 million I didn't write that down
 
05:36:41.010 --> 05:36:41.510 align:start position:0%
or 2.4 million I didn't write that down
[Music]

05:36:41.510 --> 05:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:36:41.520 --> 05:36:42.410 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

05:36:42.410 --> 05:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:42.420 --> 05:36:44.690 align:start position:0%
um
but

05:36:44.690 --> 05:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:36:46.730 --> 05:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a cost
 
05:36:46.740 --> 05:36:48.050 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a cost
okay

05:36:48.050 --> 05:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:36:52.128 --> 05:36:52.138 align:start position:0%
then the the next one uh also addresses
 
05:36:55.788 --> 05:36:55.798 align:start position:0%
a Workforce issue by adjusting the child
 
05:36:59.030 --> 05:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
care eligibility up and I'm I forget the
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
percentage it's currently I think 60 65
 
05:37:06.190 --> 05:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
60 we wanted to raise it to 85 percent
 
05:37:10.190 --> 05:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
and then we stuck with an 85 percent of
 
05:37:12.610 --> 05:37:12.620 align:start position:0%
the state availability of services
 
05:37:16.910 --> 05:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
number instead of converting it to the
 
05:37:19.850 --> 05:37:19.860 align:start position:0%
federal poverty levels to be consistent
 
05:37:22.310 --> 05:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
across our statutes we talked about
 
05:37:26.270 --> 05:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
changing to an FPL instead of this but
 
05:37:28.628 --> 05:37:28.638 align:start position:0%
we decided to keep it at the 85 percent
 
05:37:31.310 --> 05:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
Benchmark because the dollar amount
 
05:37:34.070 --> 05:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
between it and 300 percent was you know
 
05:37:38.150 --> 05:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
de minimis uh so so and since this
 
05:37:40.788 --> 05:37:40.798 align:start position:0%
language matches the federal language we
 
05:37:42.830 --> 05:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
thought it might be easier and to be
 
05:37:45.170 --> 05:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
consistent with the federal law so this
 
05:37:48.110 --> 05:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
is a Workforce issue should make a
 
05:37:51.288 --> 05:37:51.298 align:start position:0%
access to child care in theory a little
 
05:37:54.650 --> 05:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
bit easier because more people will be
 
05:37:57.288 --> 05:37:57.298 align:start position:0%
qualified for it
 
05:38:01.090 --> 05:38:01.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:05.810 --> 05:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
this was uh you know our way to say uh
 
05:38:08.810 --> 05:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
can we adjust the rates at which uh the
 
05:38:11.990 --> 05:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
child care gets reimbursed we
 
05:38:13.850 --> 05:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
um said that there's a couple of
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
different ways that you could do a rate
 
05:38:19.010 --> 05:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
adjustment one is to take a look at
 
05:38:20.750 --> 05:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
something called the true cost of care
 
05:38:23.690 --> 05:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
mechanism then the other is to take the
 
05:38:26.930 --> 05:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
75th percentile of a market rate survey
 
05:38:29.570 --> 05:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
we didn't designate which of those two
 
05:38:31.670 --> 05:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
ways the department could choose but we
 
05:38:33.470 --> 05:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
gave them the option and said
 
05:38:35.930 --> 05:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
essentially that's going to raise the
 
05:38:38.050 --> 05:38:38.060 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates for child care
 
05:38:41.810 --> 05:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
presumably we're going to find Workforce
 
05:38:45.110 --> 05:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
to actually take the higher salaries
 
05:38:50.570 --> 05:38:50.580 align:start position:0%
the item on 26 and 27 is related to the
 
05:38:52.610 --> 05:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
05:38:55.070 --> 05:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
the pdab
 
05:38:58.250 --> 05:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
um this board the chairman of division
 
05:39:03.170 --> 05:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
one and I uh took interest in from
 
05:39:07.490 --> 05:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
January of last year when a item came
 
05:39:10.250 --> 05:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
before the fiscal committee asking for
 
05:39:12.708 --> 05:39:12.718 align:start position:0%
funding and so we started to take a look
 
05:39:15.230 --> 05:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
at the statute and the statute basically
 
05:39:20.810 --> 05:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
creates the most autonomous most
 
05:39:20.820 --> 05:39:22.368 align:start position:0%
creates the most autonomous most
powerful

05:39:22.368 --> 05:39:22.378 align:start position:0%
powerful
 
05:39:26.090 --> 05:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
little entity in the state so what this
 
05:39:29.150 --> 05:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
amendment does is it and it also does it
 
05:39:30.650 --> 05:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
in a way in which a lot of what they do
 
05:39:33.410 --> 05:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
is redundant with other departments so
 
05:39:35.448 --> 05:39:35.458 align:start position:0%
what we said was let's go ahead and keep
 
05:39:38.150 --> 05:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
the program let's scale it back a little
 
05:39:41.628 --> 05:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
bit uh let's make sure that we take a
 
05:39:44.030 --> 05:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
look at the redundancy issues across the
 
05:39:45.970 --> 05:39:45.980 align:start position:0%
Departments within the state government
 
05:39:50.930 --> 05:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
and and oh by the way gel car looked at
 
05:39:53.750 --> 05:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
what was called a fee schedule in the
 
05:39:56.570 --> 05:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
pdab statute as they were doing rule
 
05:40:00.170 --> 05:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
making and unanimously determined that
 
05:40:02.750 --> 05:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
the it was probably an unconstitutional
 
05:40:06.708 --> 05:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
tax and then they specifically said you
 
05:40:08.330 --> 05:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
know this has to be relooked by the
 
05:40:11.150 --> 05:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
legislature because the way of raising
 
05:40:13.390 --> 05:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
revenue is is probably
 
05:40:15.650 --> 05:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
inappropriate so there were two
 
05:40:18.288 --> 05:40:18.298 align:start position:0%
amendments both amendments agreed that
 
05:40:20.628 --> 05:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
what we ought to be doing is instead of
 
05:40:22.368 --> 05:40:22.378 align:start position:0%
having them have this unconstitutional
 
05:40:25.190 --> 05:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
tax Authority that we should instead
 
05:40:28.010 --> 05:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
allocate General funds to them that
 
05:40:30.530 --> 05:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
solved the unconstitutional issue of the
 
05:40:33.770 --> 05:40:33.780 align:start position:0%
the tax also it it made sure that this
 
05:40:36.470 --> 05:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
this group was a little more accountable
 
05:40:40.850 --> 05:40:40.860 align:start position:0%
to the an elected body so so that's what
 
05:40:44.208 --> 05:40:44.218 align:start position:0%
the pdab amendment does there's a lot of
 
05:40:45.948 --> 05:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
detail in there
 
05:40:45.958 --> 05:40:46.670 align:start position:0%
detail in there
um

05:40:46.670 --> 05:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:51.288 --> 05:40:51.298 align:start position:0%
then online uh or excuse me Pages
 
05:40:51.298 --> 05:40:56.690 align:start position:0%
then online uh or excuse me Pages
question

05:40:56.690 --> 05:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:00.590 --> 05:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
Carol McGuire yes thank you Mr chair uh
 
05:41:03.110 --> 05:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
is this amendment compatible with the
 
05:41:05.030 --> 05:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
two or three bills and commerce dealing
 
05:41:06.590 --> 05:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
with the prescription drug affordability
 
05:41:06.600 --> 05:41:09.590 align:start position:0%
with the prescription drug affordability
board

05:41:09.590 --> 05:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:13.550 --> 05:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
I'll say yes but uh the the yes part is
 
05:41:14.990 --> 05:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure you're listening to the
 
05:41:18.050 --> 05:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
rest of it but uh representative
 
05:41:21.410 --> 05:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
leishman and I uh co-sponsor jointly
 
05:41:23.270 --> 05:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
sponsored both those bills that went to
 
05:41:26.990 --> 05:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
Commerce this this this uh bill in in
 
05:41:31.128 --> 05:41:31.138 align:start position:0%
hb2 that's in here is consistent uh I
 
05:41:32.868 --> 05:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
think pretty much line for line with
 
05:41:37.010 --> 05:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
what uh the the current amendment is in
 
05:41:40.550 --> 05:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
Commerce Commerce is holding at 10 10.
 
05:41:42.368 --> 05:41:42.378 align:start position:0%
so this
 
05:41:45.708 --> 05:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I I had asked the chairman
 
05:41:47.570 --> 05:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
to just get it on the floor and let's
 
05:41:49.850 --> 05:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
see where it stands
 
05:41:52.010 --> 05:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
um and it's still it's going to be
 
05:41:55.250 --> 05:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
retained by the committee
 
05:41:58.550 --> 05:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
but yes remember the word yes
 
05:42:01.810 --> 05:42:01.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:04.670 --> 05:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
05:42:06.350 --> 05:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
05:42:07.910 --> 05:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
please proceed
 
05:42:12.470 --> 05:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay so 28 because you know we love
 
05:42:12.480 --> 05:42:13.910 align:start position:0%
okay so 28 because you know we love
controversy

05:42:13.910 --> 05:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
controversy
 
05:42:16.430 --> 05:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
we went ahead and took the sentence
 
05:42:20.270 --> 05:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
version of Medicaid expansion and based
 
05:42:23.030 --> 05:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
on the the the bill that they passed I
 
05:42:25.788 --> 05:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
don't remember if it was 22 to 2 or 24
 
05:42:29.030 --> 05:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
to nothing they they they passed it on
 
05:42:30.770 --> 05:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
an extremely strong vote and we're going
 
05:42:33.890 --> 05:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
to be seeing it as a bill later but
 
05:42:35.810 --> 05:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
um we've we went ahead and put it into
 
05:42:35.820 --> 05:42:37.788 align:start position:0%
um we've we went ahead and put it into
hb2

05:42:37.788 --> 05:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
05:42:37.798 --> 05:42:39.310 align:start position:0%
hb2
A

05:42:39.310 --> 05:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
A
 
05:42:42.288 --> 05:42:42.298 align:start position:0%
administrative thing that we did was we
 
05:42:44.990 --> 05:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
required that any money that goes to pay
 
05:42:49.550 --> 05:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
for the Medicaid expansion Bill be put
 
05:42:52.368 --> 05:42:52.378 align:start position:0%
into the budget instead of doing this
 
05:42:55.910 --> 05:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know off the books sleight of hand
 
05:42:57.410 --> 05:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
kind of thing that I think we've been
 
05:42:57.420 --> 05:42:58.430 align:start position:0%
kind of thing that I think we've been
doing

05:42:58.430 --> 05:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:43:01.070 --> 05:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
um it just makes it open makes it
 
05:43:03.070 --> 05:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
transparent it's good government
 
05:43:06.050 --> 05:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
and because this part of the Medicaid
 
05:43:08.690 --> 05:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
Program is reimbursed by the federal
 
05:43:10.910 --> 05:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
government at extremely high rates I
 
05:43:12.830 --> 05:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
think it may be as high as 90 percent
 
05:43:15.948 --> 05:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
right now instead of the typical 60
 
05:43:18.230 --> 05:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
percent and and we know that it's going
 
05:43:20.390 --> 05:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
to decline at some point to 88 percent
 
05:43:23.208 --> 05:43:23.218 align:start position:0%
but we know that the feds are not going
 
05:43:25.430 --> 05:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
to keep this commitment forever to be
 
05:43:28.610 --> 05:43:28.620 align:start position:0%
paying on the order of 90 percent so
 
05:43:32.208 --> 05:43:32.218 align:start position:0%
what what we did in here was we put a a
 
05:43:32.218 --> 05:43:34.070 align:start position:0%
what what we did in here was we put a a
two-year

05:43:34.070 --> 05:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
two-year
 
05:43:37.970 --> 05:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
Sunset date on our version this the
 
05:43:40.190 --> 05:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
Senate said make it permanent
 
05:43:43.490 --> 05:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
our division said make it two years
 
05:43:46.368 --> 05:43:46.378 align:start position:0%
I I want to put I want to put two years
 
05:43:48.288 --> 05:43:48.298 align:start position:0%
into context for you
 
05:43:52.548 --> 05:43:52.558 align:start position:0%
this this is the contract for
 
05:43:55.730 --> 05:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
a Managed Care Organization this this
 
05:43:57.830 --> 05:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
represents you know five six hundred
 
05:44:01.788 --> 05:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
hours of man hours uh to put together uh
 
05:44:03.470 --> 05:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's put together at the state
 
05:44:06.230 --> 05:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
level by our most senior people in the
 
05:44:08.150 --> 05:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
department so it's a very expensive
 
05:44:12.770 --> 05:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
Manpower uh and this is typically one
 
05:44:15.230 --> 05:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
contract for five years
 
05:44:18.830 --> 05:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
if we do it this way with two years it's
 
05:44:21.350 --> 05:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
one contract that by the time it gets
 
05:44:24.230 --> 05:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
done is only going to be good for a year
 
05:44:26.868 --> 05:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
so so under the two-year provision in
 
05:44:29.090 --> 05:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
here we're going to be doing one of
 
05:44:31.250 --> 05:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
these essentially every year or every
 
05:44:33.890 --> 05:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
other year spending the Manpower there
 
05:44:36.650 --> 05:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
there is some good government thought
 
05:44:39.830 --> 05:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
that that instead of two years it could
 
05:44:42.288 --> 05:44:42.298 align:start position:0%
be four years it could be six years but
 
05:44:44.150 --> 05:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's a discussion this
 
05:44:49.490 --> 05:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:52.430 --> 05:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative waller for a question
 
05:44:55.390 --> 05:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
so I think the department told us how
 
05:44:59.708 --> 05:44:59.718 align:start position:0%
how much time and thought has to go into
 
05:45:03.530 --> 05:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
developing these contracts and
 
05:45:05.628 --> 05:45:05.638 align:start position:0%
um five years
 
05:45:08.390 --> 05:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
seem to be what the standard was for
 
05:45:11.330 --> 05:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
doing this kind of a very involved piece
 
05:45:13.010 --> 05:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
of work
 
05:45:13.020 --> 05:45:15.770 align:start position:0%
of work
um

05:45:15.770 --> 05:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:18.110 --> 05:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
I guess the other part about this whole
 
05:45:21.110 --> 05:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
thing is that there was a commission and
 
05:45:24.410 --> 05:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
on the commission that studied the
 
05:45:26.750 --> 05:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion for the past
 
05:45:28.430 --> 05:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
couple of years there were several
 
05:45:31.490 --> 05:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
meetings at the end of it the commission
 
05:45:31.500 --> 05:45:33.430 align:start position:0%
meetings at the end of it the commission
members

05:45:33.430 --> 05:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
members
 
05:45:36.708 --> 05:45:36.718 align:start position:0%
agreed that this program should continue
 
05:45:36.718 --> 05:45:38.330 align:start position:0%
agreed that this program should continue
permanently

05:45:38.330 --> 05:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
permanently
 
05:45:40.910 --> 05:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
and for many of us that were on it we
 
05:45:43.970 --> 05:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
signed a document saying that we agreed
 
05:45:45.590 --> 05:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
to the commission report the commission
 
05:45:47.750 --> 05:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
report is available for anyone who wants
 
05:45:49.208 --> 05:45:49.218 align:start position:0%
to see it
 
05:45:52.250 --> 05:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
so I think that there has been a lot of
 
05:45:55.070 --> 05:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
thought and a lot of work done
 
05:45:59.030 --> 05:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
around Medicaid expanded expanded
 
05:46:03.708 --> 05:46:03.718 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and the five-year taking it to
 
05:46:05.708 --> 05:46:05.718 align:start position:0%
the five years and then it makes a lot
 
05:46:10.190 --> 05:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
taking it permanently and not just to a
 
05:46:12.350 --> 05:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
two-year or a five-year
 
05:46:15.890 --> 05:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
Sunset so I hope that we can
 
05:46:18.890 --> 05:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
continue to work on this issue as it
 
05:46:21.590 --> 05:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
goes forth and we also are getting the
 
05:46:24.170 --> 05:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
bill is has passed the Senate and will
 
05:46:25.970 --> 05:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
be coming to us so there will be
 
05:46:30.048 --> 05:46:30.058 align:start position:0%
hearings and a lot of input here around
 
05:46:32.930 --> 05:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
this I don't even feel that I personally
 
05:46:34.310 --> 05:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
don't even feel this section is
 
05:46:34.320 --> 05:46:37.310 align:start position:0%
don't even feel this section is
necessary

05:46:37.310 --> 05:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:39.230 --> 05:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that and I was on that
 
05:46:41.448 --> 05:46:41.458 align:start position:0%
commission with you and somebody heard
 
05:46:43.490 --> 05:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
me say that the commission recommended
 
05:46:47.690 --> 05:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
permanent and I was told that they just
 
05:46:51.190 --> 05:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
reviewed the text and we were
 
05:46:53.690 --> 05:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
ambivalent on the length of time we said
 
05:46:55.490 --> 05:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
that the legis something of the effect
 
05:46:57.590 --> 05:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
that the legislature
 
05:46:59.208 --> 05:46:59.218 align:start position:0%
ought to consider whether or not to make
 
05:47:00.890 --> 05:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
it permanent I don't think our
 
05:47:03.288 --> 05:47:03.298 align:start position:0%
commission technically said that but
 
05:47:05.208 --> 05:47:05.218 align:start position:0%
everything else you you said I I
 
05:47:07.610 --> 05:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
basically agree with
 
05:47:10.128 --> 05:47:10.138 align:start position:0%
um if if instead of two years we said
 
05:47:12.590 --> 05:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
six years what would what would happen
 
05:47:14.990 --> 05:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
would be it would take about a year for
 
05:47:16.610 --> 05:47:16.620 align:start position:0%
the current contracts there are three of
 
05:47:19.310 --> 05:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
them so we have three mcos it would take
 
05:47:21.590 --> 05:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
about a year for those to expire and
 
05:47:24.230 --> 05:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
then uh and in that time we'd get these
 
05:47:26.150 --> 05:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
contracts in place and these want to be
 
05:47:28.610 --> 05:47:28.620 align:start position:0%
five-year contracts so if you're just
 
05:47:30.830 --> 05:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
looking at it from a business analyst
 
05:47:32.770 --> 05:47:32.780 align:start position:0%
perspective there's a strong
 
05:47:32.780 --> 05:47:34.750 align:start position:0%
perspective there's a strong
six-year

05:47:34.750 --> 05:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
six-year
 
05:47:37.368 --> 05:47:37.378 align:start position:0%
timeline that might be considered
 
05:47:40.310 --> 05:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
but we want to so
 
05:47:41.830 --> 05:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
um questions from
 
05:47:44.150 --> 05:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
representativelorski thank you
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
05:47:47.990 --> 05:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
question didn't we hear also that um
 
05:47:50.930 --> 05:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
putting out the contract or the bid for
 
05:47:52.490 --> 05:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
a two-year contract
 
05:47:55.430 --> 05:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
was not going to attract the number of
 
05:47:57.890 --> 05:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
vendors and interests would not be able
 
05:48:01.190 --> 05:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
to attract a more affordable contract
 
05:48:03.170 --> 05:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
for us because they they want to bid for
 
05:48:06.530 --> 05:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
a longer term five-year or longer that
 
05:48:08.690 --> 05:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
in the end this would probably be a
 
05:48:11.868 --> 05:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
significant additional cost on the state
 
05:48:14.150 --> 05:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
your memory of the testimony and mine
 
05:48:17.150 --> 05:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
are the same but because the chairman
 
05:48:19.368 --> 05:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
said I have to finish at four o'clock or
 
05:48:21.708 --> 05:48:21.718 align:start position:0%
something bad happens I am just pushing
 
05:48:23.150 --> 05:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
through it you don't have to finish at
 
05:48:25.490 --> 05:48:25.500 align:start position:0%
four well I said we'd likely take a
 
05:48:27.948 --> 05:48:27.958 align:start position:0%
break oh okay good good thanks we'll
 
05:48:30.948 --> 05:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
have I just got a note that uh from I
 
05:48:33.708 --> 05:48:33.718 align:start position:0%
guess it's from the LBA that since
 
05:48:36.230 --> 05:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we've although we have 26 bills
 
05:48:39.770 --> 05:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
to exec I think 16 of them are retained
 
05:48:41.750 --> 05:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
so I don't expect a lot of discussion on
 
05:48:45.770 --> 05:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
retained bills so we may have time to go
 
05:48:49.010 --> 05:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
into division three and and in the in
 
05:48:50.390 --> 05:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
the later part of the day after we
 
05:48:53.150 --> 05:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
finished with all the executing so we'll
 
05:48:55.010 --> 05:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
plan and also I wanted to announce for
 
05:48:57.350 --> 05:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
any other public that's here to listen
 
05:49:00.170 --> 05:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
yes I had told you earlier that we've
 
05:49:02.690 --> 05:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
spent all day tomorrow on executing but
 
05:49:04.128 --> 05:49:04.138 align:start position:0%
now that I look at the number that are
 
05:49:07.730 --> 05:49:07.740 align:start position:0%
on retain I have a different opinion so
 
05:49:10.128 --> 05:49:10.138 align:start position:0%
there will be time left to I hadn't been
 
05:49:12.350 --> 05:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
able to see how many were recommend was
 
05:49:14.930 --> 05:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
retained until today so there will be
 
05:49:16.548 --> 05:49:16.558 align:start position:0%
time for you tomorrow
 
05:49:19.910 --> 05:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
so all right uh thank you sir So
 
05:49:23.208 --> 05:49:23.218 align:start position:0%
speaking of retaining bills uh Pages 32
 
05:49:27.110 --> 05:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
and 33 represent House Bill 565 that uh
 
05:49:29.810 --> 05:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
that uh division three recommends be
 
05:49:32.570 --> 05:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
retained uh this was sponsored by
 
05:49:36.110 --> 05:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative Megan Murray uh what it
 
05:49:40.010 --> 05:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
does is it takes postpartum care under
 
05:49:41.930 --> 05:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and extends it from three
 
05:49:45.048 --> 05:49:45.058 align:start position:0%
months of Eligibility to 12 months we
 
05:49:47.810 --> 05:49:47.820 align:start position:0%
had testimony from Dr Ballard the chief
 
05:49:50.690 --> 05:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
medical officer at DHHS that the
 
05:49:54.350 --> 05:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
12-month standard is kind of the is
 
05:49:57.708 --> 05:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
clinically appropriate and so this is uh
 
05:49:59.510 --> 05:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
this is two hundred thousand dollars
 
05:50:04.128 --> 05:50:04.138 align:start position:0%
this was FY 24 only
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
and Mr Ripple is this the one where I
 
05:50:09.830 --> 05:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
was supposed to mention that we need to
 
05:50:12.350 --> 05:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
probably consider an amendment to make
 
05:50:15.350 --> 05:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
this uh non-lapsing so that any money we
 
05:50:20.208 --> 05:50:20.218 align:start position:0%
appropriate is good for fy25 as well
 
05:50:21.590 --> 05:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
if the committee wanted us to change
 
05:50:24.650 --> 05:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
this from to for the biennium ending
 
05:50:27.230 --> 05:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
June 30th 2025 instead of the fiscal
 
05:50:29.270 --> 05:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
year ending June 30th 2024 that's
 
05:50:31.430 --> 05:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
something we could do as uh that's how
 
05:50:33.410 --> 05:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
spill two was put together
 
05:50:36.410 --> 05:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair I apologize I I don't know
 
05:50:38.330 --> 05:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
how this got by division three but it
 
05:50:41.270 --> 05:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
did and I think division three my guess
 
05:50:43.368 --> 05:50:43.378 align:start position:0%
is that we'd all probably support that
 
05:50:45.230 --> 05:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
05:50:46.910 --> 05:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
you want to change distance rather than
 
05:50:49.128 --> 05:50:49.138 align:start position:0%
one year to a two year yes sir without
 
05:50:53.150 --> 05:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:56.708 --> 05:50:56.718 align:start position:0%
I I I think that was just an oversight
 
05:50:56.718 --> 05:50:58.250 align:start position:0%
I I I think that was just an oversight
apologies

05:50:58.250 --> 05:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
apologies
 
05:51:01.430 --> 05:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay so Mr Ripple has is the ability to
 
05:51:03.170 --> 05:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
do that
 
05:51:03.180 --> 05:51:07.490 align:start position:0%
do that
okay

05:51:07.490 --> 05:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:09.830 --> 05:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you I just wanted
 
05:51:13.490 --> 05:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
to clarify do we know if that amount was
 
05:51:15.410 --> 05:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
budgeted for the two years and it's just
 
05:51:18.110 --> 05:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
a technical error in the writing or if
 
05:51:22.730 --> 05:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:26.470 --> 05:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
in the hurried huddle in between changes
 
05:51:29.930 --> 05:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh there was a quick agreement the 200
 
05:51:32.570 --> 05:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
000 was the right amount amongst the
 
05:51:34.850 --> 05:51:34.860 align:start position:0%
legislators without me talking to the
 
05:51:38.090 --> 05:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
LBA or to the department but my
 
05:51:39.830 --> 05:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is two hundred thousand
 
05:51:42.948 --> 05:51:42.958 align:start position:0%
for the two years was acceptable
 
05:51:44.510 --> 05:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
and that we just need to make it
 
05:51:44.520 --> 05:51:45.890 align:start position:0%
and that we just need to make it
non-lapsing

05:51:45.890 --> 05:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
05:51:48.890 --> 05:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
and right now Mr Ripple is taking a look
 
05:51:52.670 --> 05:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
or I think whether or not it's it ought
 
05:51:57.590 --> 05:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
to be 400 000 or should cap to 200.
 
05:52:01.368 --> 05:52:01.378 align:start position:0%
do you have a quick one Mr White
 
05:52:02.810 --> 05:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
you don't know
 
05:52:15.110 --> 05:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:18.230 --> 05:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
well I don't know what the intent was of
 
05:52:20.208 --> 05:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
the sponsor or of the policy committee
 
05:52:22.548 --> 05:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
that the bill came out of
 
05:52:22.558 --> 05:52:25.490 align:start position:0%
that the bill came out of
um

05:52:25.490 --> 05:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:27.770 --> 05:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
if you look at the fiscal note it's it
 
05:52:30.830 --> 05:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
reflects a higher figure per year it
 
05:52:30.840 --> 05:52:31.970 align:start position:0%
reflects a higher figure per year it
reflects

05:52:31.970 --> 05:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
reflects
 
05:52:33.650 --> 05:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
an estimated cost of between three
 
05:52:34.970 --> 05:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand to one million per
 
05:52:40.910 --> 05:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:43.490 --> 05:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
so I I don't want to do budgeting on the
 
05:52:46.070 --> 05:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
Fly we had an agreement that we would
 
05:52:48.770 --> 05:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
just make it non-lapsing
 
05:52:51.530 --> 05:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
so since we can only do one Amendment
 
05:52:54.350 --> 05:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
I'd I'd suggest doing that
 
05:52:54.360 --> 05:52:55.930 align:start position:0%
I'd I'd suggest doing that
okay

05:52:55.930 --> 05:52:55.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:53:00.530 --> 05:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
represent or on pages 34 36
 
05:53:04.010 --> 05:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
this is another retained bill this is a
 
05:53:09.070 --> 05:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
HB 91 this is a bill that the house
 
05:53:12.470 --> 05:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
voted on we voted on it twice now by the
 
05:53:14.810 --> 05:53:14.820 align:start position:0%
way we voted on the almost exactly the
 
05:53:17.270 --> 05:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
same bill in the previous term this
 
05:53:19.788 --> 05:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
would already be law but it was taken
 
05:53:21.770 --> 05:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
hostage in a committee a conference and
 
05:53:24.650 --> 05:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
and was killed as part of a failed
 
05:53:29.510 --> 05:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
negotiation but but HB 91 establishes a
 
05:53:30.890 --> 05:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
couple of requirements on the Department
 
05:53:33.948 --> 05:53:33.958 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services to form a
 
05:53:37.250 --> 05:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
privacy Council that's consistent with
 
05:53:40.850 --> 05:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
corporate standards it also establishes
 
05:53:45.010 --> 05:53:45.020 align:start position:0%
a risk mitigation approach and it funds
 
05:53:48.350 --> 05:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
a couple of Specialists that have the
 
05:53:51.230 --> 05:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
training and somehow after all this time
 
05:53:53.930 --> 05:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
this is another one that got by me got
 
05:53:55.970 --> 05:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
by us but I'll I'll take full
 
05:53:59.930 --> 05:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
responsibility on line 24 it says it's
 
05:54:02.090 --> 05:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
300 thousand dollars for the fiscal year
 
05:54:04.250 --> 05:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
ending in 2024 this should have been
 
05:54:06.890 --> 05:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing and this one I know is meant
 
05:54:09.650 --> 05:54:09.660 align:start position:0%
to be three hundred thousand per term so
 
05:54:13.010 --> 05:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
I I would ask Mr Ripple to prepare an
 
05:54:14.990 --> 05:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
amendment for us to vote on you know
 
05:54:17.090 --> 05:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
tomorrow that makes it three hundred
 
05:54:20.628 --> 05:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
thousand a year for two years each I
 
05:54:22.490 --> 05:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
think in this case and the previous case
 
05:54:24.048 --> 05:54:24.058 align:start position:0%
this is something you could do verbally
 
05:54:25.788 --> 05:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
without a new amendment being presented
 
05:54:27.048 --> 05:54:27.058 align:start position:0%
to you
 
05:54:29.868 --> 05:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
I I I don't know I defer to the chairman
 
05:54:32.270 --> 05:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
on those I think those were the only two
 
05:54:34.310 --> 05:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
where we had this issue right
 
05:54:38.030 --> 05:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
do you want to vote on on the going from
 
05:54:39.770 --> 05:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
uh 300
 
05:54:43.910 --> 05:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:48.590 --> 05:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:48.600 --> 05:54:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:54:53.030 --> 05:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:55.190 --> 05:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
I think this change is uncontroversial
 
05:54:57.708 --> 05:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
enough that we could
 
05:54:59.448 --> 05:54:59.458 align:start position:0%
we meaning the LBA could make this
 
05:55:01.548 --> 05:55:01.558 align:start position:0%
change as a technical change if the
 
05:55:03.350 --> 05:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
committee opts to adopt this amendment
 
05:55:04.788 --> 05:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
package so I don't think you need to
 
05:55:06.170 --> 05:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
take another vote on this item
 
05:55:06.180 --> 05:55:09.230 align:start position:0%
take another vote on this item
specifically

05:55:09.230 --> 05:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:10.788 --> 05:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
you don't think we need to have a vote
 
05:55:13.910 --> 05:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
now about the previous one
 
05:55:15.890 --> 05:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
it's if you would like to take a vote by
 
05:55:17.930 --> 05:55:17.940 align:start position:0%
all means do but I think this item is
 
05:55:19.310 --> 05:55:19.320 align:start position:0%
technical enough in nature that it's
 
05:55:20.570 --> 05:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
something that we could just do on your
 
05:55:22.070 --> 05:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
on the committee's behalf
 
05:55:23.930 --> 05:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen at the end of this
 
05:55:26.208 --> 05:55:26.218 align:start position:0%
at this end of this meeting I will be
 
05:55:28.490 --> 05:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
making a
 
05:55:30.470 --> 05:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
an announcement that I hereby authorize
 
05:55:32.390 --> 05:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
the LBA to make any Technical and
 
05:55:34.548 --> 05:55:34.558 align:start position:0%
mechanical changes necessary to reflect
 
05:55:36.590 --> 05:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
the intent of the committee
 
05:55:38.570 --> 05:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
so if that's acceptable to everybody
 
05:55:40.730 --> 05:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
that's what I will make at the end of
 
05:55:43.010 --> 05:55:43.020 align:start position:0%
this and then that allows them
 
05:55:45.948 --> 05:55:45.958 align:start position:0%
especially on divisions one and two to
 
05:55:47.330 --> 05:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
go in and make anything that's been
 
05:55:49.430 --> 05:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
brought up that needs to be corrected
 
05:55:52.250 --> 05:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
and then at the end of the final at the
 
05:55:54.590 --> 05:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
final end of division three I'll make
 
05:55:56.090 --> 05:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
that same announcement so they can begin
 
05:55:58.970 --> 05:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
working on Technical and mechanical uh
 
05:56:00.770 --> 05:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
Corrections that have been identified so
 
05:56:03.230 --> 05:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
without objection
 
05:56:05.690 --> 05:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
that's the way they will proceed is
 
05:56:09.410 --> 05:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:12.948 --> 05:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
seeing none that's how we will proceed
 
05:56:15.230 --> 05:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
oh should I continue with the next item
 
05:56:17.470 --> 05:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
page 37
 
05:56:20.810 --> 05:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
this was another retained Bill sponsored
 
05:56:23.750 --> 05:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
by a representative Joe Shapiro it's
 
05:56:27.910 --> 05:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's formerly known as House Bill 282
 
05:56:27.920 --> 05:56:30.070 align:start position:0%

dollars is being needed allocated in FY
 
05:56:38.628 --> 05:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
24 and just said it was going to be
 
05:56:41.650 --> 05:56:41.660 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing this will be used
 
05:56:45.470 --> 05:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
to for the children and pregnant women
 
05:56:48.830 --> 05:56:48.840 align:start position:0%

known as the children's health insurance
program

05:56:54.890 --> 05:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:57.590 --> 05:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay on page
 
05:56:57.600 --> 05:57:01.070 align:start position:0%
okay on page
38

05:57:01.070 --> 05:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:04.930 --> 05:57:04.940 align:start position:0%
this was formerly known as House Bill
 
05:57:04.940 --> 05:57:06.970 align:start position:0%
this was formerly known as House Bill
614

05:57:06.970 --> 05:57:06.980 align:start position:0%
614
 
05:57:10.970 --> 05:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
we've recommended retaining and this is
 
05:57:12.548 --> 05:57:12.558 align:start position:0%
related to
 
05:57:16.670 --> 05:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
the water situation in Merrimack this
 
05:57:19.910 --> 05:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
bill is the the God child of
 
05:57:22.128 --> 05:57:22.138 align:start position:0%
Representative Mooney do you want to say
 
05:57:24.650 --> 05:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
anything on this representative Mooney
 
05:57:26.628 --> 05:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
thank Mr chairman just to remind
 
05:57:28.670 --> 05:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
everyone that Merrimack is the location
 
05:57:32.270 --> 05:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
of the worst pfas contamination in the
 
05:57:32.280 --> 05:57:33.350 align:start position:0%
of the worst pfas contamination in the
country

05:57:33.350 --> 05:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
country
 
05:57:37.970 --> 05:57:37.980 align:start position:0%
this bill would authorize phase three of
 
05:57:40.970 --> 05:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
a feasibility study on the increased
 
05:57:43.970 --> 05:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
amount of kidney cancers in the
 
05:57:45.910 --> 05:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
Merrimack the town of Merrimack region
 
05:57:51.470 --> 05:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
only twice twice in 10 years has a
 
05:57:53.448 --> 05:57:53.458 align:start position:0%
feasibility study been recommended to go
 
05:57:56.090 --> 05:57:56.100 align:start position:0%
from phase two to phase three because of
 
05:57:58.910 --> 05:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
the severity of the circumstance and
 
05:58:01.610 --> 05:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
this is one of those instances so with
 
05:58:04.628 --> 05:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
that I would like to actually mention
 
05:58:07.490 --> 05:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative Nancy Murphy who was the
 
05:58:11.330 --> 05:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
sponsor Prime of House Bill 614 and that
 
05:58:13.310 --> 05:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
exact language to have that feasibility
 
05:58:15.770 --> 05:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
study go from phase two to three it will
 
05:58:18.530 --> 05:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
be in House Bill 2 soon I hope with your
 
05:58:19.970 --> 05:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
support thank you
 
05:58:22.430 --> 05:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
can you describe what phase three might
 
05:58:22.440 --> 05:58:25.128 align:start position:0%
can you describe what phase three might
entail

05:58:25.128 --> 05:58:25.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:28.250 --> 05:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
as I understand it Faith three is a more
 
05:58:31.250 --> 05:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
concentrated effort on the community in
 
05:58:34.910 --> 05:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
order to make the feasibility study
 
05:58:37.548 --> 05:58:37.558 align:start position:0%
known better and to communicate with
 
05:58:39.410 --> 05:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
those who have been affected or think
 
05:58:41.628 --> 05:58:41.638 align:start position:0%
they may have been affected in order to
 
05:58:44.810 --> 05:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
do a deeper study into the increase in
 
05:58:47.750 --> 05:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
cancer numbers so it likely will be the
 
05:58:49.670 --> 05:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
first time there'll be a human study all
 
05:58:52.368 --> 05:58:52.378 align:start position:0%
the all the reports I read are all
 
05:58:54.890 --> 05:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
rodent studies and they don't really get
 
05:58:57.288 --> 05:58:57.298 align:start position:0%
into humans they just say we think this
 
05:58:59.868 --> 05:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
we think that based upon the rodent
 
05:59:01.430 --> 05:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
study so this would be the first time
 
05:59:06.548 --> 05:59:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:09.470 --> 05:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
and I I think we all know it but still
 
05:59:11.390 --> 05:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
worth mentioning this past the house
 
05:59:14.390 --> 05:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
policy Committee in the House vote so
 
05:59:14.400 --> 05:59:15.170 align:start position:0%
policy Committee in the House vote so
um

05:59:15.170 --> 05:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:19.548 --> 05:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
all right uh moving on to page 39 the
 
05:59:21.890 --> 05:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
last in the package
 
05:59:24.948 --> 05:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
um the very first hearing
 
05:59:28.128 --> 05:59:28.138 align:start position:0%
of division three where we heard that to
 
05:59:31.208 --> 05:59:31.218 align:start position:0%
bring a kid into the sununu center
 
05:59:33.650 --> 05:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
required a strip search
 
05:59:36.708 --> 05:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
we all acted as one to say that's
 
05:59:38.810 --> 05:59:38.820 align:start position:0%
unacceptable is there an alternative and
 
05:59:40.368 --> 05:59:40.378 align:start position:0%
the department was ready with an
 
05:59:42.708 --> 05:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
alternative pretty quickly where they
 
05:59:46.010 --> 05:59:46.020 align:start position:0%
can put a full body scanner in there and
 
05:59:51.650 --> 05:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
allow the intake of the detainee uh with
 
05:59:54.650 --> 05:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
more dignity than a first if than a
 
05:59:56.510 --> 05:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
strip search upon you know first
 
05:59:58.970 --> 05:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
greeting and given the importance of a
 
06:00:01.430 --> 06:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed therapeutic based Care
 
06:00:04.190 --> 06:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
Center those body scanners more
 
06:00:04.200 --> 06:00:05.448 align:start position:0%
Center those body scanners more
appropriate

06:00:05.448 --> 06:00:05.458 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
06:00:07.690 --> 06:00:07.700 align:start position:0%
so what we did
 
06:00:10.788 --> 06:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
because this was a the estimate was
 
06:00:12.830 --> 06:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand so we put a not
 
06:00:16.250 --> 06:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
to exceed 325 000 we did it with the
 
06:00:19.250 --> 06:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
expectation that the service costs would
 
06:00:21.830 --> 06:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
be included in that initial contract so
 
06:00:23.510 --> 06:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
we'd get through the fiscal year at
 
06:00:26.110 --> 06:00:26.120 align:start position:0%
least if not more
 
06:00:29.090 --> 06:00:29.100 align:start position:0%
the department agreed to eat that money
 
06:00:31.490 --> 06:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
out of the budget that the governor had
 
06:00:33.170 --> 06:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
already approved
 
06:00:36.110 --> 06:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
we then also reduce their budget a
 
06:00:37.548 --> 06:00:37.558 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year because they had
 
06:00:39.230 --> 06:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
budgeted overtime
 
06:00:42.288 --> 06:00:42.298 align:start position:0%
and in order to help them meet the
 
06:00:44.270 --> 06:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
commitment to get the body scanner and
 
06:00:46.190 --> 06:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
to get to keep the Personnel on site
 
06:00:47.990 --> 06:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
that are needed and other expenses
 
06:00:50.750 --> 06:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
operate for the next two years we
 
06:00:52.970 --> 06:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
granted them a great deal of transfer
 
06:00:55.250 --> 06:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
Authority so that they can manage the
 
06:00:58.070 --> 06:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
money that we do give them and so with
 
06:01:01.490 --> 06:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
that flexibility uh the department was
 
06:01:05.628 --> 06:01:05.638 align:start position:0%
was okay at this point with the proposal
 
06:01:08.330 --> 06:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
and so Sir with that I'm done with the
 
06:01:11.390 --> 06:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
thick package and the short package all
 
06:01:14.770 --> 06:01:14.780 align:start position:0%
of these are basically hb2 references
 
06:01:17.510 --> 06:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's approaching four o'clock I'll I'll
 
06:01:19.128 --> 06:01:19.138 align:start position:0%
do what you'd like
 
06:01:22.190 --> 06:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
Here's my thought since we have a couple
 
06:01:24.948 --> 06:01:24.958 align:start position:0%
of substitute people with us today who
 
06:01:27.948 --> 06:01:27.958 align:start position:0%
have heard all this discussion and they
 
06:01:30.708 --> 06:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
may not be with us tomorrow
 
06:01:34.070 --> 06:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
if we go to do your hb1 piece tomorrow
 
06:01:35.868 --> 06:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
when we have different people
 
06:01:37.910 --> 06:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
then I would
 
06:01:40.970 --> 06:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
unusual to the first two divisions I
 
06:01:42.770 --> 06:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
would like to make a separate vote for
 
06:01:45.530 --> 06:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
your presentation on hp2 if there's no
 
06:01:47.628 --> 06:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
objection since as I said we have some
 
06:01:49.788 --> 06:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
substitutes and I want to make sure that
 
06:01:51.530 --> 06:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
the people who have heard the discussion
 
06:01:54.590 --> 06:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
are the people who vote so
 
06:01:57.770 --> 06:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the the clerk to the motion
 
06:02:01.788 --> 06:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
will be to accept the hb2 Amendments
 
06:02:04.310 --> 06:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
from division three that have been
 
06:02:06.110 --> 06:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
briefed thus far
 
06:02:06.120 --> 06:02:07.490 align:start position:0%
briefed thus far
and

06:02:07.490 --> 06:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:09.948 --> 06:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
I'll say the emotions made by
 
06:02:12.470 --> 06:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards to be seconded by
 
06:02:16.010 --> 06:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney and is there any
 
06:02:18.948 --> 06:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
further discussion or questions on that
 
06:02:18.958 --> 06:02:20.990 align:start position:0%
further discussion or questions on that
process

06:02:20.990 --> 06:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:02:24.170 --> 06:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
seeing none representative Wallner well
 
06:02:26.150 --> 06:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
even though I have spent the last
 
06:02:27.830 --> 06:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
several months here working on the
 
06:02:29.590 --> 06:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
division three
 
06:02:32.448 --> 06:02:32.458 align:start position:0%
amendments and the presentation
 
06:02:35.570 --> 06:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
I am going to vote no I still feel that
 
06:02:38.390 --> 06:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid reimbursement rates are too
 
06:02:41.750 --> 06:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
important to not fund them at a higher
 
06:02:45.010 --> 06:02:45.020 align:start position:0%
level so that we don't we don't
 
06:02:49.010 --> 06:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
take the chance of losing any of these
 
06:02:51.770 --> 06:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
really important providers and I'm also
 
06:02:53.750 --> 06:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
very concerned about
 
06:02:58.330 --> 06:02:58.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:01.788 --> 06:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
expansion that's in this in-house Bill
 
06:03:04.070 --> 06:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
too I think is completely unnecessary to
 
06:03:06.770 --> 06:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
have it there thank you
 
06:03:09.170 --> 06:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
06:03:11.510 --> 06:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative kofault
 
06:03:14.448 --> 06:03:14.458 align:start position:0%

Representatives uh with the intelligence
 
06:03:26.410 --> 06:03:26.420 align:start position:0%

particularly grateful for the chair
 
06:03:32.470 --> 06:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
co-chair and Mr Ripple uh and I
 
06:03:34.970 --> 06:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
appreciate the hard work and diligence
 
06:03:37.270 --> 06:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
to prioritize and fund the services
 
06:03:41.868 --> 06:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
which is some Medicaid rates and um
 
06:03:44.150 --> 06:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
I like
 
06:03:44.160 --> 06:03:44.990 align:start position:0%

like representative walner do come down
 
06:03:49.670 --> 06:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
that we're too far short for me to be
 
06:03:51.410 --> 06:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
able to vote for this amendment at this
 
06:03:55.128 --> 06:03:55.138 align:start position:0%
time because of the um uh the potential
 
06:03:57.288 --> 06:03:57.298 align:start position:0%
risk to the Medicaid system at this
 
06:03:59.690 --> 06:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
level of funding but
 
06:04:02.930 --> 06:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
um I acknowledge the great work that was
 
06:04:06.470 --> 06:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
done and uh hope that it can continue to
 
06:04:10.850 --> 06:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:14.150 --> 06:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
