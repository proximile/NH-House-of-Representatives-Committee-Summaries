00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
reality the apprenticeship board
 
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the past was given the authority
 
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
to approve registered apprenticeships in
 
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
and that's that authority has been taken
 
00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
by the the federal government now
 
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
since 2007 um and so
 
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
the the effort here is really just to
 
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
square the existing state law on
 
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.870 align:start position:0%
square the existing state law on
apprenticeship

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship
 
00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
with the the reality of federal control
 
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
over this
 
00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
so everything in these sections i see
 
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
some strikeouts
 
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
those are things that the federal
 
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
government has taken over
 
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
and you no longer can do is am i correct
 
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
that is correct all right you wanted
 
00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 align:start position:0%
before i opened it to
 
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
questions you want to go back to what mr
 
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
hoffman said about the previous couple
 
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.670 align:start position:0%
hoffman said about the previous couple
of

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
sections uh certainly uh if you can
 
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
remind me which
 
00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
which topics uh because i don't have i
 
00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
don't have the material in front of me i
 
00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 align:start position:0%
was just
 
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
i was just listening again i think this
 
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
is i think mr hall was pretty clear
 
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
section 125 your workers comp
 
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
strikes fiscal year in the preceding
 
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
calendar year so it just says
 
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
in the preceding calendar year which
 
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
makes sense and then down below
 
00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
it struck the word words two words the
 
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
work so it says
 
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
per damn for each day devoted to
 
00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 align:start position:0%
hearings of the board
 
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
we are assuming you're working and then
 
00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
you no longer have to mail
 
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
certified return receipt but instead it
 
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
will be either first-class mail or
 
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
upon the consent of parties by
 
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
electronic transmission
 
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
and you are okay with those i
 
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely we requested these uh
 
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
all in all instances the language that
 
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
we've requested in house bill 2
 
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh again squares us with
 
00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
actual practice the department has
 
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
for years been conducting its business
 
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
in this way and in fact in some
 
00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
instances we were cited
 
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
by the legislative budget assistant in
 
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
in financial audits
 
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
for not doing things according to
 
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.670 align:start position:0%
for not doing things according to
statute

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 align:start position:0%
and uh so this is this is my effort to
 
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
to square us with with state law the
 
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
things that the department has been
 
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
has been doing for a number of years the
 
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
with regard to the change from
 
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to calendar year we've got
 
00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 align:start position:0%
a number of different uh
 
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
factors involved in those assessments
 
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
and it would actually this isn't a
 
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
simpler change than having to change
 
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
some of the other
 
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
procedures that we have uh if i can
 
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
how can i do this in a few words uh the
 
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.390 align:start position:0%
how can i do this in a few words uh the
the

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
um self-insured workers comp
 
00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
those entities report to us because of
 
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
because of statute
 
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
and administrative rule they report
 
00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
their claims to us
 
00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 align:start position:0%
on a calendar year basis the insurance
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
department has been
 
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
giving us carrier information in the
 
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
same way
 
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and so our
 
00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
assessments for these two
 
00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
funds that you see represented in house
 
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
bill 2
 
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh have been calculated based on
 
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
calendar year claims
 
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
and and we're just trying to make the
 
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
statute read
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
in a way that's that's appropriate for
 
00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 align:start position:0%
what our practice is
 
00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
okay so we have mrs lavinas followed by
 
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative welts
 
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday manager thank you um on the
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
line one yep this was just something i
 
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
noticed yesterday
 
00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
the language uh beginning in the middle
 
00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
of that line
 
00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
page on line one such per diem shall be
 
00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
per rated to an
 
00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
hourly rate for other related work
 
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
performed by board members
 
00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
um and i thought i believe that's just a
 
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
typo in the bill but i want you to
 
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay can we i can make a note of that we
 
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
can change that
 
00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
at any time is that something we can do
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
in a row in enrolled bills as opposed to
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
getting an amendment
 
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of the budget process the
 
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee generally votes to
 
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
allow the lba to make technical
 
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
amendments that do not affect
 
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
substance perspective is that works
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
something like that so we can hear that
 
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
make a note of that
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
represent walls yes i'm concerned with
 
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
what it is that we are no longer
 
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
requiring certified mail for
 
00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
and i just want to have a clear
 
00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
understanding of that so that we're not
 
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
violating the due process rights of
 
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
people so if somebody could explain
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
clearly to me i mean it's hard to do
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
this during the hearing
 
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
of exactly is it that there's going to
 
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
be a hearing is it an appeal of a
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
hearing what is it that we no longer
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
if if i might uh it is it is
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
it is uh a notice of hearing
 
00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
and and again uh as i as i mentioned
 
00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:19.830 align:start position:0%
and and again uh as i as i mentioned
earlier

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
this is to square the statute with what
 
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
the actual practice
 
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
here at the labor department has been
 
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
we have not been sending these here
 
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
notices certified mail
 
00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 align:start position:0%
if we did it would represent an
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
extraordinary increase in costs
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
for the department uh they have been
 
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
using u.s
 
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
mail here for for as long as anyone here
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
can remember
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh may i follow up follow up so if if
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
a person defaults on this
 
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
is there any attempt to follow up
 
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
through certified mail or any way
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
of trying to understand why they
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
defaulted at the perhaps the mail didn't
 
00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
get to them or
 
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
what happens if there's a default yes
 
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.950 align:start position:0%
what happens if there's a default yes
certainly

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
there there are additional contacts
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
attempted certainly
 
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
and are you i guess what i'd like to say
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
is if we're not going to use certified
 
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.629 align:start position:0%
is if we're not going to use certified
mail

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
mail
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
i want to put i want to codify the fact
 
00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
that there must be
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
some sort of additional contacts if
 
00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0%
there's a default because
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
i have heard too many stories perhaps
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
not on this particular issue but around
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
the state of people going so far as to
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
lose their house because
 
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
there was not proper notification
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
because it was sent first class mail to
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
a prior residence
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
they didn't get notification and
 
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
literally a default judgment
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
had just taken their house from them and
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
this isn't
 
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
represented walls this is not about
 
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.189 align:start position:0%
represented walls this is not about
mortgages

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
mortgages
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
i understand that but this is very
 
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
limited but it's the same principle
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
people need to have notification other
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
than straight up mail because default
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
judgments are very harmful
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i just want to have some sort of
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
recognition in here that if there's a
 
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.749 align:start position:0%
recognition in here that if there's a
default

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:57.759 align:start position:0%
default
 
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
that the the um commissioner or his
 
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
agency has an obligation to follow up as
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
to why there was a default that it's
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
why don't we find out for mr mayorfield
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
if they ever have a default
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
to see if we even have that issue mr
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
mayorfield you understand
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
her concern even though you're not a
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
mortgage can you
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
explain for us if you have a default and
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
if so what the
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
process is yeah i i think i think
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's worth a mention that that any
 
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.070 align:start position:0%
it's worth a mention that that any
decision

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
made by our department in the hearings
 
00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:32.629 align:start position:0%
made by our department in the hearings
bureau

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
has has numerous appellate uh avenues to
 
00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:37.350 align:start position:0%
has has numerous appellate uh avenues to
pursue

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
pursue
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
um i mean i could i could get you more
 
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.950 align:start position:0%
um i mean i could i could get you more
information

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
from the heroes hearings bureau
 
00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:44.629 align:start position:0%
from the heroes hearings bureau
administrator

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
about what happens and what additional
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
efforts are made to
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
to contact people but i would just
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
reiterate again
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
this has been our practice for decades
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
to use only u.s mail
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
so so it's not a change in practice
 
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
certainly and and i think we have to
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
consider at least
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
the the financial implications for the
 
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
department the the hearings bureau uh
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
administrator recommended this language
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
to us i asked you know my
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
managers to alert me to situations where
 
00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:23.189 align:start position:0%
managers to alert me to situations where
statute

00:08:23.189 --> 00:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
required something that was not
 
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
efficacious to current practice in the
 
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
department so that's why we raised this
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to get more information for
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
you about
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
you know what what is happening but but
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
it is the actual practice of the
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
department for as long as anyone can
 
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.350 align:start position:0%
department for as long as anyone can
remember

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm not interested in asking
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
the department to unnecessarily spend
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
money on postage i'm fine with first
 
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
class postage in the majority of cases
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
i just wanna clear that
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
in the case of a default where somebody
 
00:08:59.350 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
is not making an appearance after
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
hearing has been
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
been scheduled that there is some
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
obligation on the
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
part of the department to do additional
 
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
matters and i think
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
that needs to be codified not just a
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
recognition of practice because there's
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
no guarantee it's going to happen that
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
if we codify it that there's an
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
obligation on the behalf of the
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
department i think then
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
there's no problem with no longer
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
requiring certified mail that's not
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
being done anyway but i want to make
 
00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:25.030 align:start position:0%
being done anyway but i want to make
sure

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
that anybody has appropriate notice
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
that's basic due process and if we don't
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
do that we can be sued
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
mr mayfield will you get us one
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
the additional information and two
 
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
will you let us know what the practice
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
has been since you've been doing this
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959 align:start position:0%
you surely have one or two people who
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
didn't get to a hearing
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
in a decade long process and if you
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
could send that information to
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
janet clayman she will get that to all
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
of us and we would appreciate that
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you in that case
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
can we approve sections 125
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
126 and 127
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
which stops prior to the section
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
of that mr mirrorfield is going to get
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
us more information so we're going to
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative emery moves the approval
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%

1826 127 representative leishman seconds
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
on that or are you okay with that
 
00:10:38.069 --> 00:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm absolutely okay with that uh

lavina said
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%

lba to make some technical
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
corrections and she has noted that as
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
one that needs to be made so it will be
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%

i'll move on to slide two for the slide
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
deck that you have
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh and i won't dwell on this too much
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
but just just to give you an idea of the
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
layout of our agency
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh for those who aren't aware
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
and again i can however the chair would
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
like i can answer questions on the flyer
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh i'll move to slide three which is our
 
00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
mission statement
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh again hopefully you're all familiar
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
with that which is to protect
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
the environment public health in new
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire uh
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
some of our core functions uh which is
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
this the next slide
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
slide four uh representative walsh you
 
00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
no i don't think she does her hand went
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
down oh okay
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
so of late uh you we've the department's
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
been as
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
has much focus on water infrastructure
 
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.509 align:start position:0%
has much focus on water infrastructure
wastewater

00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
wastewater
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
issues and contamination issues so we
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
have other core functions but those have
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
really been the
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
the driving factors of late uh moving to
 
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.470 align:start position:0%
the driving factors of late uh moving to
slide

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
five uh we detail that a little bit more
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know i'll talk some more about some
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
of these things so for example for
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh water uh contamination especially
 
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh obviously pfas is the four letter
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
word that
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
uh that we have of late uh we
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
also have uh we'll discuss later in the
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
minutes in the budget
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh a new fund that was created uh last
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
fighting m for bonding
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
authorized bonding of up to 50 million
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
dollars for
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
pfas issues for as a loan fund
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh so that's uh you know related in a
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
newer thing
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
for infrastructure the drinking water
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
is a relatively new and ongoing
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
initiative and then of course the
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
drinking water and clean water
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
state reloading loan funds uh have been
 
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:10.870 align:start position:0%
state reloading loan funds uh have been
uh

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
very uh you know they've been
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
oversubscribed uh and are very i think
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
impactful to the communities so with
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
that i'll go to slide
 
00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
six and again just for some of our
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
budget highlights
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
uh you know overall our budget is just
 
00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
shy of 255
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars for 22. uh we're showing
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh 489 uh authorized positions
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh 89 of those at the moment are are
 
00:17:37.679 --> 00:17:38.950 align:start position:0%
uh 89 of those at the moment are are
vacant

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
vacant
 
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh and uh you'll see uh
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
there's over 115 federal grant
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
and uh over 40 dedicated funds within
 
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
within the agency just to kind of
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
orient the committee uh moving to slide
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
seven uh our presentation uh for the
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
slides will certainly
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
mostly focus on uh fiscal year 22 budget
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's pretty
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
close to what our 23 budget is uh
 
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
and to give you some perspective uh our
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
ceo sue carlson uh has created some of
 
00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:10.230 align:start position:0%
ceo sue carlson uh has created some of
the

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:11.909 --> 00:18:11.919 align:start position:0%
some of the pie charts you'll you'll see
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
here as you come through uh
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
so percentage-wise again just to orient
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
we are roughly nine percent general
 
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.510 align:start position:0%
we are roughly nine percent general
funds

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh nearly half of that is uh state aid
 
00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
grants to the communities
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh 23 is federal funds or
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
close to 60 million dollars uh 68
 
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
is other funds so if we break that down
 
00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:36.549 align:start position:0%
is other funds so if we break that down
that

00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh 172 million dollars uh
 
00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
the the mostly clean water state
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
revolving loan fund
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh payments are about 27 percent of that
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
uh the 22 is the drinking water
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh the waste fee programs account for
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
31 percent of that proportion the water
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
fee programs another 14
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
the air fee programs about five percent
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
in the commissioner's office another two
 
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.029 align:start position:0%
in the commissioner's office another two
percent

00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh so looking at that overall the state
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
revolving loan
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
fund programs are about 35 of our
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
overall budget
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
so moving on to slide eight uh also to
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
see how the funds are used
 
00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh the operating budget is about 25
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
percent salary and
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
benefits nine percent is operating
 
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:26.470 align:start position:0%
benefits nine percent is operating
expenses

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh service debt uh and other
 
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.470 align:start position:0%
uh service debt uh and other
miscellaneous

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh that leaves about two thirds of our
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
budget again for grants and loans
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
contracts and oil fund uh reimbursements
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh loans is our largest category at 39
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
of of that so i'll move on
 
00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh for the interest of time to slide
 
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:48.870 align:start position:0%
uh for the interest of time to slide
nine

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
nine
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh this is broken up by uh divisions
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh as you see the water the water
 
00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.590 align:start position:0%
uh as you see the water the water
division

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
is about 53 percent of uh the entire
 
00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.909 align:start position:0%
is about 53 percent of uh the entire
budget

00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
and about 53 percent of the staff
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
waste division uh is about 40
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
at 102 million dollars and the air
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
division in the commission's office make
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
up the remaining 7 percent
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh or roughly about 118 staff combined
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh moving on to slide 10 uh
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll see that the fiscal year
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
22 growth
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh is primarily due to the creation of
 
00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:28.710 align:start position:0%
uh is primarily due to the creation of
our

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
the emergent contaminant emerging
 
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.390 align:start position:0%
the emergent contaminant emerging
contaminant

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
contaminant
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
program in the waste management division
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
so that will be on page
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
834 of your book i believe that's what
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
you're looking at
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh and in the last biennium
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
des was granted six million dollars out
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
of the drinking water groundwater trust
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
fund for investigation of pfas issues
 
00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh in testing and uh some work on that
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
end and again as i mentioned uh in last
 
00:20:57.679 --> 00:20:58.630 align:start position:0%
end and again as i mentioned uh in last
planning

00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
planning
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
allowed us to do bonding for up to 50
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars for a pfas loan program
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh that was part of the house bill four
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
uh ultimately uh so des added 15 million
 
00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:13.990 align:start position:0%
uh ultimately uh so des added 15 million
dollars

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
per year to this operating budget
 
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.350 align:start position:0%
per year to this operating budget
request

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh and uh with the same
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
with that we also decreased some uh
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
other contract appropriations by uh
 
00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:25.190 align:start position:0%
other contract appropriations by uh
three

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
almost four million dollars so uh the
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
grants as you see is due to uh the
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
drinking water groundwater trust fund uh
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
which is on page 833
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh that was a 4.5 million dollar
 
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:40.950 align:start position:0%
uh that was a 4.5 million dollar
increase

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh again we had some smaller reductions
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
from other programs
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh one new federal grant to draw your
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
attention to
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh is the data is a line is on
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
page 787 and that's for dam assessments
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
so the budget shows a million dollar
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
increase for consultants
 
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh that's to use federal funds to
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
perform uh
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
a fairly detailed engineering assessment
 
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:07.750 align:start position:0%
a fairly detailed engineering assessment
uh

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
and design work on uh state-owned flood
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
control dams uh
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
that were originally constructed by the
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
national resource conservation service
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
uh and particularly the three dams on
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
the south eakin river watershed
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
so that i'll draw your attention to that
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
because that that is a
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
significant change uh with that and
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
also um compared to 20
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
for 22 there's a three percent increase
 
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.590 align:start position:0%
for 22 there's a three percent increase
uh

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
regarding salary and benefits uh and
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
then in 23 uh
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
due to the 27th pay period there was a
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
further increase
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh for for fiscal year 23. i assume all
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
the state agencies are showing that
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
um i'll move on to slide 11.
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
um and if i'm going too fast please
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
please tell me
 
00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh so slide 11 this table shows how the
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
department's broken down again by
 
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
funding source
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh the general funds uh decreased
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
roughly by 12 primarily due to
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
reductions in salary and benefits
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
contracts grants and and that decrease
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
continued until 2020
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me the 23 fiscal year budget
 
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
the trust fund the groundwater drinking
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
water groundwater trust fund
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh increased
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
with grants and all others uh
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
on the on the slide there uh increases
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
uh again that's the emerging
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
contaminants account i just talked about
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's a roughly 10.2 million dollar
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
increase plus minor increases for
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh other fee accounts um
 
00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
so i'll move on to slide 12. uh
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
so answering the the chair the chair's
 
00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.310 align:start position:0%
so answering the the chair the chair's
questions

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh that was transmitted to us so the
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
first question is what new full-time
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
positions have been added to the budget
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh this is a slide showing that i'll
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh the following slides will detail
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
those individually
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
so i'll move on to slide 13. so under
 
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
new positions
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
uh answering question number one um
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
so this this is for uh
 
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
our public information center we get a
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
fair amount of traffic for
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh information requests uh particularly
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
under 91 a
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
request so we were looking to staff that
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
a little bit better
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
with the program assistance so that's
 
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.430 align:start position:0%
with the program assistance so that's
the

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
one of the five uh requests we have in
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
this new
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
this budget uh request the moving to
 
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
slide 14
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
are our one stop uh which is the the
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
term we use for our
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
combined databases and public-facing
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
um services that we provide on the web
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh there's a fair amount of work needs
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
to be done to that that's a
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
really a result of 20 years of for
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
one of a better technical word uh
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
conclusion together
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
individual databases that have been made
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
by the programs over the year to help
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
years to help serve the public uh those
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
are all housed
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh together under what we call our one
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
stop uh database
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh that needs a lot of work uh and and
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
to be um
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh to be uh able to be used in the
 
00:25:22.159 --> 00:25:22.950 align:start position:0%
uh to be uh able to be used in the
future

00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh we're looking for a business systems
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
analyst to help with that
 
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
that effort uh moving to uh
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
slide 15 uh our wastewater engineering
 
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.510 align:start position:0%
slide 15 uh our wastewater engineering
bureau

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
is also looking for some uh extra
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
support for the work
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
they do uh that's the uh
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
and again they have the clean water srf
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
certain amount of oversight for the
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
construction that goes along with that
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that state aid grants
 
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:49.590 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that state aid grants
uh

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
happen we have similar issues on that as
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
an example
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
bob could you go back to one stop for a
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
minute certainly
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
first bullet talks about one stop
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
and then last bullet talks about new one
 
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.789 align:start position:0%
and then last bullet talks about new one
stop

00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
stop
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
are you upgrading writing new what's
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
we are hoping to and if you look at the
 
00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
capital budget we also have
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
funds in there to to revamp one stop
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
so i give you an example so last
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
uh kovitz put a a
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
stop in my time clock here but uh if i
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
go back a little over a year ago
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh we had an issue where doit
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
had their contractor had done some uh
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
some scans if you will and as it turned
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
out that most of our database under what
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
one stop uh the coding that it was
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
created with uh
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
actually had uh allowed for
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
vulnerabilities for cyber security so we
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
end up having to bring the system down
 
00:26:55.269 --> 00:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
while they recoded uh really as a as a
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
band-aid uh because we were under a time
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
crunch because people needed the service
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
to to
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
at least get that system so it wouldn't
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
have the same vulnerabilities
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
so that that whole system really needs
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
to be revamped and redone
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh again some of the databases are you
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
know approaching on 20 years
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
as you well know a lot happens
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
especially in this kind of technology so
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh that's what we're referring to is our
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
new new one stop so we have some cap
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
capital budget requests as well uh and
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
this would help support that
 
00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:24.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
[Music]

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
so i'll go back to remember where i was
 
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.310 align:start position:0%
so i'll go back to remember where i was
here

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
um i think i talked about the wastewater
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
engineering bureau position
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
and going to uh slide 16
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
is an environmentalist position uh to
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
help with
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
residential well drinking water issues
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
so more than
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
roughly 50 of all the wells uh
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
all the drinking water in our state
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
comes from private wells uh
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
and with the uh contaminated excuse me
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
contamination issues we've been finding
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh statewide uh we're really finding
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
that to be a
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
an area where we need to provide more um
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
more focus on so that's an attempt to
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
help help that
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
so and again so now i'll go to slide 17.
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
so as i mentioned for one stop our waste
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
management division also
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh could do with some help uh
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
the one stop is department-wide uh but
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
we're also looking at
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh needs within that division
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
more specifically for database work uh
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
you know the good news
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're finding as we do database work uh
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
the public generally certainly the
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
regulated public too
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh really start to depend on that so the
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
good news is as we start to do it the
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
more they want
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
and the the bad news is uh and you can't
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
backtrack understandably because people
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
start to depend on this type of thing so
 
00:28:50.399 --> 00:28:50.950 align:start position:0%
start to depend on this type of thing so
we're

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
we're trying to provide that service it
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
not only helps obviously the
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
the public but it helps the agency run
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
more efficiently also
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
so moving to slide 18
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
the letter the chair had sent also asked
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
question number three is what positions
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
did we have to eliminate to meet the
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
governor's budget requirements so
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh what we did do is under the national
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
pollutant discharge elimination system
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
or niptis
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the small municipal separate storm
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
sewer system or ms4 programs
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh last biennium i think it was uh
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
biennium before we had some positions
 
00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.710 align:start position:0%
biennium before we had some positions
created

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
to help uh the agency and uh more
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
explicitly the municipalities
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
to provide assistance uh for those
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
federal programs so
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
the the ms4 program in particular uh
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
if you look at a map of the state would
 
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.389 align:start position:0%
if you look at a map of the state would
cover

00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
cover
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh the the southern part of the state uh
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
south south east part of the state so a
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
lot a lot of municipalities
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh this particular position would be for
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
a financial
 
00:30:03.029 --> 00:30:03.039 align:start position:0%
analyst that's something the agency
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
typically doesn't have in our
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
in our quiver of uh tools and
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
this is intended to help that uh those
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh help to help the agency help the
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
to uh look at their requirements and how
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
can they
 
00:30:22.149 --> 00:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh more effectively and cost effectively
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
uh meet the federal requirements so uh
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
given the the fiscal constraints of
 
00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.510 align:start position:0%
given the the fiscal constraints of
covid

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
covid
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
we elected not to to fund this position
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
we absolutely do
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
want the position uh and and ideally we
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
would like it
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
but uh given the financial
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
considerations when we were developing
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh we hope that the position is able to
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
stay but yet
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh we could live a biennium without
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
funding the position so that's what
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
in slide 18.
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
slide 19 answers the questions
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
about effectively uh paraphrases can we
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
do our job
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
and meet state law with the budget
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
and as as requested and the short answer
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
is yes we think we can
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
uh we have again the five positions
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
we've asked for
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
in this budget uh the real issue is
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned currently we have 86 open
 
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:18.950 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned currently we have 86 open
positions

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039 align:start position:0%
is recruiting and and getting those
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
positions filled but uh
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
pending that yes we we do feel uh we
 
00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:25.750 align:start position:0%
pending that yes we we do feel uh we
will

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
continue to be able to do our job slide
 
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.029 align:start position:0%
continue to be able to do our job slide
20

00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
is a question about have we found any
 
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:32.950 align:start position:0%
is a question about have we found any
laws

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
that we think should be eliminated uh
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
short answer is
 
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
not at this time uh we are uh
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
a place where the agency is not bashful
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
about talking to legislators so if we as
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
we do see something that could be
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
either streamlined or certainly
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
eliminated uh
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
you know that we understand that we
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
should be coming forward to you all
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh as a legislative body uh on
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
page excuse me slide 21 uh
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
answers uh question number seven uh for
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
what priorities were not
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
funded uh so i will refer
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
that we have three three on our priority
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
needs list uh
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
that weren't funded uh originally in the
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh i will i assume you've all seen the
 
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.149 align:start position:0%
uh i will i assume you've all seen the
governor's

00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
uh letter to you all of the third of
 
00:32:23.039 --> 00:32:24.070 align:start position:0%
uh letter to you all of the third of
march

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
march
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh so there's on the slides
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
are three uh items there's actually a
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
fourth item
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh which was added and is on the
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
governor's list on that three march
 
00:32:35.039 --> 00:32:35.750 align:start position:0%
governor's list on that three march
letter

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
letter
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh so since that's not on the the next
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
slide i'll talk about it now so that's a
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
mercury analyzer
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh so that's 55 000
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh so the background of that is uh
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
almost all the new hampshire water
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
bodies uh are mercury impaired
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh and we know this because we've had
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
basically about a 30-year data record
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
for that and we have statewide mercury
 
00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.590 align:start position:0%
for that and we have statewide mercury
advisories

00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
advisories
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh for the state uh
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
in fact last year we added more fish
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
species to the advisory list
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
so this this ana the current analyzer we
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
had is really
 
00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely at the end of his useful
 
00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:13.509 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely at the end of his useful
life

00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
and it's is uh as you may imagine uh
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
after a while that you can't get parts
 
00:33:18.399 --> 00:33:18.630 align:start position:0%
after a while that you can't get parts
for

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
some of these old analyzers so uh that
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
was an ask we
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
we had of late and that is in the
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
governor's uh
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh letter of third the third of march
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh so what is in the slides uh is uh on
 
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
that prioritized needs list
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
is uh slide number 22. so we had a
 
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.029 align:start position:0%
is uh slide number 22. so we had a
request

00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
for some consulting work to help our
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
wetlands program
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh get e-permitting get closer to be
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
able to do an e-permitting
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
system we also had
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
which is item a on slide 22 and then
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
we also had requests for
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
maintenance activities at our superfund
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste sites
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
and then item c is for a four wheel
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
drive vehicle to help support that
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
program also
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
slide uh 23 there was
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
questions also in the chairs letter to
 
00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:15.669 align:start position:0%
questions also in the chairs letter to
us

00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
about house bill 2. so
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
i we took the liberty here of uh talking
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
about state aid grants so
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh state a grants and house bill 2 uh
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
continues a moratorium on um
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
on state aid grants
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
what we we bring up here there are
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
multiple bills both for drinking water
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
and for wastewater state state aid
 
00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.790 align:start position:0%
and for wastewater state state aid
grants

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
grants
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh those conflict conflict a little bit
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
the budget size wanted the budget
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
requests i just want to draw your
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
attention to that
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
just for background uh you probably most
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
of you already know this
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
but the state of grant programs and
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
after the fact reimbursement
 
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
usually for about 20 of the project cost
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
and historically uh
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
it's been done for uh wastewater
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
treatment plants so
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh clean water uh which is the term of
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
art for that
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh so uh so these two
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
two bills since i'm talking about them
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
the the drinking water systems grant
 
00:35:20.079 --> 00:35:20.950 align:start position:0%
the the drinking water systems grant
bill

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh i'll draw your attention to our
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
testimony letter my testimony letter
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
on that uh unlike clean water
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
the clean water state a grant where
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
we've we've had that program off and on
 
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
running for a while with existing staff
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh the drinking water program uh
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
for state aid grant hasn't uh basically
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't existed since 2008
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
there was a small amount in 2011. so so
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
we have no
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
program to administer that right now
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's not the staffing for that so
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
we'd have to stand up
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
that and uh again i know it's a little
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
bit outside the budget
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
per se but it's related uh and uh so
 
00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
are suggesting in that my suggestion in
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
that letter was
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
there's the state revolving loan fund
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's a drinking water grower
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
trust fund there's this new pfast loan
 
00:36:11.109 --> 00:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
fund uh
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
and that may be a better way more
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
efficient way rather than standing up
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh staff to do a new program so i just
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
want to draw your attention to that and
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
again as always we can answer questions
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh for that there are issues and sue
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
carlson can talk to
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh on uh the state a grant
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
is in the uh operating budget to the
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
extent that
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh prior work was done
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
by 2019 uh and we also had existing
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
um obligations met so if the project
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
effectively the the requests had gone
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
through the government council already
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh so certainly sue can answer more
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
questions if you have on that
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
and then almost wrapping up here on
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
slide 24.
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh again as i mentioned uh on house bill
 
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.069 align:start position:0%
uh again as i mentioned uh on house bill
2

00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
2
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
we're asked to comment on that uh
 
00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.349 align:start position:0%
we're asked to comment on that uh
section

00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
59 extends the date for the
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that we had gotten six
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
out of the drinking water groundwater
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
trust fund it extends the date
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh for that that money as far as the sun
 
00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:16.870 align:start position:0%
uh for that that money as far as the sun
setting

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
setting
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
for us uh in section 60 i think they're
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
all on
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
page 26 of house bill 2
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh establishes a moratorium on new state
 
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
aid grants
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
and then of course we will pay attention
 
00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:34.870 align:start position:0%
and then of course we will pay attention
to

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of hospital too as you're well
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
aware talks about the department of
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
energy so to the extent there's any uh
 
00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:40.230 align:start position:0%
energy so to the extent there's any uh
overlap

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
overlap
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh we'll we'll pay attention to that
 
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
issue also so with that i i don't want
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
to ramble on too much more than i have
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh and we're very happy to answer any
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chairman so you said earlier
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
you had a number of
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded or vacant positions i think he
 
00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:09.349 align:start position:0%
unfunded or vacant positions i think he
said

00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
something like 89. are those all
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
funded or are not funded yes
 
00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:17.440 align:start position:0%
those are all funded those are all
 
00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
funded okay
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
so as you're well aware that during the
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
the hyder covid you know we
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
we were basically just about filling
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
positions so that that kind of added to
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
that and then of course we have the
 
00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.829 align:start position:0%
that and then of course we have the
normal

00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
normal
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
sequence of retirements and people
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
moving on and that type of thing
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
further follow-up thanks so i'm looking
 
00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.349 align:start position:0%
further follow-up thanks so i'm looking
at

00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
dam operations excuse me
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
on page 761 and i
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
saw where in other areas where
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
electricity heat water had
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
stayed the same or gone down but on this
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
particular line out of
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
23 it's going roughly from six thousand
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
dollars a year to sixteen
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars can you explain why
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
that's up so high
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna let my chief operating officer
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
try to take a stab at that i'm gonna put
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
her on the spot thank you
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
yes um what we were seeing is a
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
large increase in electric rates um
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
at our dams and as we convert dams from
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
manual operations to
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
automated operations
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
that obviously increases our utility
 
00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.030 align:start position:0%
that obviously increases our utility
bills

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
to run those automated systems and
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's what's driving the increase
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
no further go ahead further okay
 
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh also there uh i see that
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
you're reducing the number of staff from
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
eight to seven and there were some other
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
areas like wetlands you're reducing
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
staff from like nine to eight could you
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
tell us why you're reducing in those
 
00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:02.950 align:start position:0%
tell us why you're reducing in those
areas

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
essentially what we did was we moved
 
00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:06.069 align:start position:0%
essentially what we did was we moved
staff

00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
around in this case
 
00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
under dam operations um what we did is
 
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:13.190 align:start position:0%
under dam operations um what we did is
they

00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
had a position that they were not using
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
so we converted that position um
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
to a paralegal position and actually
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
moved it
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
from this account up to
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
the thousand and two account which you
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
and in wetlands what you will see with
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
what we did was we moved
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
um one of our positions that was a
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
general fund position
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
to one of the fee accounts and we did
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
that to stay within the governor's
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
budget um recommendation on reduction in
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
all right uh mr chairman i'll let
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
someone else go but i do have a
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
further question aren't you you're on a
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
roll okay thanks
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
so i know this is a question for you sue
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
or mike wimsett but i had a question on
 
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.190 align:start position:0%
or mike wimsett but i had a question on
uh

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
you know we've seen you know we've
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
talked about this in the past mike
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh all the solid waste issues in the
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
state there was a committee forum
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
some time ago that looked into this and
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
was concerned that whereas some states
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
like vermont is beginning food waste
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is banning
 
00:41:41.109 --> 00:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
construction waste we're still accepting
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
all of this here in the state is the
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
state looking any further
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
in regulating what we have so we have
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
room to dispose of our waste instead of
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
accepting a lot of the waste from states
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
around us
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative eastman
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
for the question so so there's been a
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
interest in the whole topic of solid
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
waste management particularly with
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
regard to recycling and diversion
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
you know from technologies for diverting
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
solid waste from landfill disposal
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
we do have a lot of work going on we
 
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
were actually pretty excited we have
 
00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:17.990 align:start position:0%
were actually pretty excited we have
been

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
under-resourced in this program for a
 
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
long time in terms of not having the
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
available staff to work on those types
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
of initiatives
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
and we actually have a uh reorganization
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
playing in with the division of
 
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
personnel right now
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
and we have in this proposal the
 
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
on positions and an organizational
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
structure that'll help us start to focus
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
on those things so we're very optimistic
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
about that we're also going to be
 
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.510 align:start position:0%
about that we're also going to be
working

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.079 align:start position:0%
on a state solid waste management plan
 
00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
um that will
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
and we expect to be engaging uh
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from across the
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
panoply of interest there so it'll
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
include uh you know legislators
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
and members of the public waste industry
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
representatives and
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
business communities so we're we're
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
really excited about that in the future
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
but it's it's
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
it is certainly true that our ability to
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
address those kinds of issues
 
00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:11.599 align:start position:0%
in recent years has been pretty limited
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
so just a quick follow-up
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
good thanks mr chairman so you're saying
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
mike that
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
it looks a little brighter than it did
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
maybe two years ago
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know there was a like i said maybe
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
earlier there was a group a committee
 
00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.510 align:start position:0%
earlier there was a group a committee
commission

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
that looked at it was very concerned so
 
00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
you see some
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
opportunities to address some of these
 
00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:33.670 align:start position:0%
opportunities to address some of these
concerns

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
i do and actually that that that
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
committee that was pulled together
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
i think was house bill 617 um really was
 
00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:41.109 align:start position:0%
i think was house bill 617 um really was
a

00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
kind of a catalyst for that they met
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
they had i think a number of meetings in
 
00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
just two months i think they met
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
something like 14
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
times they heard from about 50 witnesses
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
and they really collected a lot of
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
information and kind of developed a road
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
map for the kinds of things that
 
00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
that we want to be working on and i i
 
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
would go so far as to say i think we
 
00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.670 align:start position:0%
would go so far as to say i think we
enjoy

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
enjoy
 
00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
um more interest and support both from
 
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.240 align:start position:0%
in our you know within our own des
 
00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:06.950 align:start position:0%
in our you know within our own des
leadership

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
and in the governor's office in the
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
legislature than we've ever seen before
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm very optimistic that the co in
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
the coming couple of years we're going
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
doing some really good work in that area
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
i know we have a lot of faith in you
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
mike so
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
good luck thanks mr chairman
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you mr
 
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.230 align:start position:0%
representative okay thank you mr
chairman

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you commissioner scott for
 
00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
being here and i i really appreciate
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
your handout because
 
00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:32.319 align:start position:0%
the fonts are large enough for me to
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
read i greatly appreciate that
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
um i apologize for uh my ignorance
 
00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh i was surprised to see that you do
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
loans are those loans to municipalities
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
could you clarify that for me please
 
00:44:48.069 --> 00:44:48.079 align:start position:0%
sure so there's
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
two major now three uh loan programs
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
that we have so the the state revolving
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
loan program
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
so we have one for drinking water
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
which is what it says the other one's
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
for clean water
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh and that's a term of art so you know
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
when you hear clean water think of
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
actually waste water to clean the waste
 
00:45:08.319 --> 00:45:09.030 align:start position:0%
actually waste water to clean the waste
water

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh or storm water that type of thing and
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
then the third
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
new loan fund is uh
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
fast uh impacted uh uh
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
entities and then to complicate things
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
even more we have the drinking water
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund which does loans
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
and does grants uh and that's again for
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
drinking water
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
so uh the srf programs
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh hopefully somebody will correct me
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
if i get it wrong but
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
the sr programs are start on a federal
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation so we have two major
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
accounts there
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh the the the money we get from the
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
feds and then since they are
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
loans even though they can have certain
 
00:45:50.309 --> 00:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
amount of loan forgiveness
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh we also have an account for their
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
repayment funds which we again
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
then turn back out uh so short answer is
 
00:45:57.119 --> 00:45:57.430 align:start position:0%
then turn back out uh so short answer is
yes

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
uh primarily uh these go to
 
00:45:59.839 --> 00:46:01.670 align:start position:0%
uh primarily uh these go to
municipalities

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
for their water and clean water
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects
 
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah follow up also in
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
what is the interest rates uh involved
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
for these loans to the municipalities
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
sure i want to talk about the latest one
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
latest interest rate
 
00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:23.839 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon yes for the clean
 
00:46:23.839 --> 00:46:24.390 align:start position:0%
um good afternoon yes for the clean
water

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
our interest rate is set at two percent
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
and for drinking water
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
it is a variable rate starting i think
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
at 1.58 and going up
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
if you were to check our website
 
00:46:41.349 --> 00:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
we set the rates once a year every fall
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
and those rates hold for the entire year
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
and we can send you that link if you
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
would like
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh follow up uh are those
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
rates compounded or is it a flat rate
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
what we do is under epa guidelines
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
we follow what is called the uh 11-year
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
geo bond rating
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
to use as the base for setting our
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you if i could add as
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
sue mentioned it we're really under they
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
are relatively low compared to others
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
generally speaking so they're attractive
 
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:25.589 align:start position:0%
generally speaking so they're attractive
um

00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
but they are are uh you know we're under
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines on how we set those
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
so it's not
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's not at our whim uh the other
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
probably downside to
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
the srf loans in some respects is the
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
federal cross cutters because
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
because the genesis of this is federal
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
money so
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
wage reporting or american steel
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
requirements that type of thing so
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
so there is a little bit of
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
administrative cost to taking these
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
loans that
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
that other monies may not have
 
00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.030 align:start position:0%
that other monies may not have
associated

00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
associated
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner i have a question uh on
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
your handout
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
you reference section 191 which is the
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
creation of the department of energy
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
and now that goes on many many sections
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
after that
 
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
my question is just in maybe from the 30
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
000 foot level what
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
what is the effect of this department or
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
the interaction with this department or
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
your your issues plus or minus
 
00:48:36.630 --> 00:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
with this reorg so a few things and
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
none of them are i won't say we have any
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
major uh
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh issues with the legislation uh or
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
our interactions but right now my staff
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
deal with uh
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
osi office of special initiatives on for
 
00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:50.710 align:start position:0%
osi office of special initiatives on for
instance

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
uh the state is in receipt of uh
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
funds from the volkswagen diesel
 
00:48:56.079 --> 00:48:57.270 align:start position:0%
funds from the volkswagen diesel
settlement

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
we work with them on 15
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
of those funds go to electrification for
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh electric vehicles in the state
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh we do uh with with them at osi
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
we work on the there's some federal
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
money that comes in for
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
diesel emissions retrofit or diesel
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
missions retrofit act
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh funds from congress that we we kind
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
of work with osi
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
on so we have interactions with that
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
will of course be subsumed
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
into the new department of energy so we
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
have those interactions
 
00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh we have a seat on the energy
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency and sustainable
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
energy board uh so that's that will be
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
at least administratively assigned in
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
some respects
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
to uh to that agency
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh i'm vice chair of the site evaluation
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh by statute
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh that will will then be
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh so so those are the type of things so
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
it's more on the peripheral
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
if you will okay thank you
 
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.190 align:start position:0%
other questions

[Music]
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
you're in the governor's budget book
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
you'll be you start on page 713
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
and go on quite a ways
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh i would ask miss carlson if
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
if you have any pages you'd like us to
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
particularly note where there's
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
variances that might catch one's eye
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
because sitting here paging through this
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
entire book
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
could could be a laborious process
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
we tried in our presentation to identify
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
those areas where we had significant
 
00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.230 align:start position:0%
those areas where we had significant
changes

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
in the budget um just so that you didn't
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
have to go through all 135 pages of our
 
00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.390 align:start position:0%
have to go through all 135 pages of our
budget

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
if i don't have a particular pages
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
um for you to suggest other than the
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
ones we have already given you
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine i just so the two again
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
our biggest thing if you let me let me
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
show you where our single biggest change
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
is in
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
and that is down
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
on page 833
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
and that is um account 8873 which is our
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
emerging contaminated account
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
that um shows where we have um
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
where the pfast money is being budgeted
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
for 22 and 23.
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the one program that had the
 
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
one of the most significant changes to
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
representation thanks mr chairman
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
another issue of concern is uh in the
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
past damn maintenance and i see you've
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
gone up
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
some well fairly significantly there
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh how are we doing on the dams and the
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
maintenance of all the dams that are
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
under your
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh on the capital budget side we
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
actually had a
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
fair increase uh because of that so we
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
have two issues i i think i called out
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
on uh page 787
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
the extra million dollar for the uh
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
some of our state-owned dams from
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
federal money for an assessment
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
on the capital budget we're also looking
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
at uh asset management help
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
on on our dams also so
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
short answer is is uh you know we the
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
capital budget and operating budget work
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
for us this cycle
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh i will say as a
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
word of things to come for future
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
budgets uh the
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
the closer we look at our dams and we're
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
again we're we're doing some work to get
 
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.510 align:start position:0%
again we're we're doing some work to get
uh

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
contract work to look at our dams also
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
the more we're finding so
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know to be blunt uh you know one
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the things i have an ear towards
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
is to the extent there's monies coming
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
from the feds that could be used for
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
this type of thing that may be a good
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
way to
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
get us uh back on an even keel if you
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
will for the future
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh but by and large it's something that
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
that looms large on our
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
radar screen and uh you know
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
without you know maybe federal funds
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
come to help us on that end
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
you'll see a larger especially on the
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
capital budget side
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh a larger request than than we have
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
in the past uh to keep our dams uh
 
00:53:54.790 --> 00:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh whole if you will thanks thanks mr
 
00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.270 align:start position:0%
uh whole if you will thanks thanks mr
trump

00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
trump
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
okay do you have any
 
00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
any comments you'd like to offer the
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
workshop at this time so it just to
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
follow up on
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
uh representative leitchman's last
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
question so to give you an idea the
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
average age of our state-owned dams is
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
as rough
 
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
as is a little over 100 years old right
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
so we're
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
we have a an aging fleet if you will so
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
and as always obviously i hope you know
 
00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
this but
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
if we can answer any questions or
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
anything you have
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%

okay well thank you very much as far as
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%

uh we will reconvene tuesday morning at
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
at that time we'll be considering five i
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
believe it's five bills now
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
4 25 was waived off so we
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
will see you next tuesday at nine
 
00:55:11.359 --> 00:55:13.109 align:start position:0%
will see you next tuesday at nine
o'clock

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:20.240 align:start position:0%
so this question
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
i think that's what the chair the chair
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
planned was yeah
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
yes yeah yeah it's like getting your
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
teeth drilled no novocaine
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
so mr chairman yes um
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
