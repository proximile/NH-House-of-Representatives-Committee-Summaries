uh members of the committee for hearing

my testimony today i'm here to talk
 
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 align:start position:0%
about my bill hb1124
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
to mandate e-verify
 
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
the issue of illegal immigration
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
is one that is top on the minds of my
 
00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.309 align:start position:0%
is one that is top on the minds of my
constituents

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
and people all across my district
 
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
and really this entire state have asked
 
00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 align:start position:0%
what can we do
 
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
to try to alleviate some of the concerns
 
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
and problems from illegal immigration
 
00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 align:start position:0%
last year 1.9 million illegal immigrants
 
00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:50.550 align:start position:0%
last year 1.9 million illegal immigrants
entered

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
entered
 
00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
through the southern border
 
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
so we have an unprecedented rise in
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants we have an
 
00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
unprecedented rise in the past year of
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
drug overdoses we see a rise of crime
 
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
and just general economic issues and so
 
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
how to solve illegal immigration is one
 
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
of the issues that's top on my
 
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
constituents minds
 
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.509 align:start position:0%
constituents minds
now

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:16.310 align:start position:0%
now
uh

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
issues or solutions like uh providing
 
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
more border security or building a wall
 
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
or empowering ice one those are all
 
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
things we can't do in the state of new
 
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire but two
 
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
those are all policy solutions that are
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
deeply divided if you look at the poll
 
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
numbers many don't support those in our
 
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
country and in our state
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
but what is the one solution to legal
 
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.749 align:start position:0%
but what is the one solution to legal
immigration

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
that is efficient and widely popular
 
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
with republicans independents and even
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
democrats depending on the poll you look
 
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
at mandatory e-verify a majority of
 
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
businesses already implement e-verify
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
in this state and across the country
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's relatively easy to conduct it's a
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
common sense solution to deal with the
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
issue of illegal immigration
 
00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 align:start position:0%
all this bill does is mandate e-verify
 
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
which is just a quick check to see if
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
someone that a business is hiring is in
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
fact a legal immigrant
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
this does not
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
go after illegal immigrants this does
 
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
not deport illegal immigrants all this
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
does is make sure businesses in new
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire that are hiring folks are
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
following the law and hiring legal
 
00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 align:start position:0%
immigrants so this is a relatively
 
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
we have many regulations
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
this is not a very intrusive one but
 
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
this is an important one
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
at this time i'm happy to take
 
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
any questions and actually i'll just add
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
to be very clear the people of new
 
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.029 align:start position:0%
to be very clear the people of new
hampshire

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
do not want illegal immigration in this
 
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
state and this is a common sense
 
00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 align:start position:0%
solution to crack down on illegal
 
00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:12.790 align:start position:0%
solution to crack down on illegal
immigration

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions at
 
00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:18.430 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions at
this

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
time thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.469 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
where would the
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
information go to after
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
a certain person would apply for a job
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
and is verified
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
would it be purged or
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative for the
 
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.390 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative for the
question

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.350 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
does not outline
 
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
to an individual that would be an
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
that's not what this bill is about this
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
bill is not a punitive measure to go
 
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
after legal immigrations after legal
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
immigrants all it does
 
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
is it mandates and puts the liability on
 
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
the business so they are not hiring
 
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants plus in a way it
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
reduces their liability because if
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
they're conducting this this background
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
check essentially they know that they're
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
not hiring illegal immigrants
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
all it does
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
is if they pass or excuse me if they
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
don't pass that check because they are
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
an illegal immigrant they're no longer
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
hired it doesn't mean necessarily that
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
they're being deported but what you
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
would expect over time is if illegal
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
immigrants are not able to pass this
 
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
check they can't get a job they would
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
likely move to other states over time
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
because they're going to go to places
 
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
where it's easier for them to get a job
 
00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:57.670 align:start position:0%
where it's easier for them to get a job
so

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
you can you can um i hope that i'm
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
answering your question in the sense
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
that this bill doesn't outline that all
 
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
it does is put the emphasis on the
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
employer to make sure the person they're
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
hiring is legal or not does that answer
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
your question sir
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question just out of curiosity
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
and pardon me for not knowing the
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
question but is this a big problem in
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.390 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
question

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
not only from just constituents but also
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
businesses in my district the issue of
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
illegal immigration is one that's top on
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
the minds
 
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.750 align:start position:0%
the minds
of

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
of my constituents if you look at polls
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
it's one of the top three issues in the
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
country so it absolutely is a big issue
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
and as i outlined because of just the
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
general economy rising crime rise in
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
overdoses people are very concerned
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question i
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up on my on a question
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
of my colleague mr susie and is there
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
anything currently preventing an
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
employer from using the irreversify
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
representative uh there is not
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
and a majority of businesses in this
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
country already use e-verify
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
and there's many businesses in new
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire especially those that operate
 
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:34.240 align:start position:0%
in multiple states
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
in some states which require e-verify
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
that they already use it in new
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire so this bill just mandates it
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
for every business but there's
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing that require that
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
prevents excuse me a business from using
 
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
e-verify in this state
 
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.910 align:start position:0%
e-verify in this state
follow-up

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh so in a sense while this the
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
intention may be good you are in fact
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
yeah it's pretty straightforward this is
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
an additional layer of regulation and
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
there's some folks
 
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.190 align:start position:0%
there's some folks
um

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
typically from the more conservative
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
side that might be against this bill for
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
that reason
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
i would just say that we have a
 
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden in this country that's
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
1.75 trillion dollars we have
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
lots of regulations for the health or
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
safety of a variety of different things
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
why can't we have a widely popular not
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
very intrusive efficient regulation to
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
deal with one of the biggest issues
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
illegal immigration
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
so that would be my
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
sort of argument that sure this is a
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
small additional regulation but we have
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
lots of regulations why would we not
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
have a regulation that's not that
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions a lot of hands i see
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
everybody let me go in order here
 
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.430 align:start position:0%
everybody let me go in order here
representative

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.269 align:start position:0%
representative
warden

00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
warden
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
and thanks for your testimony
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
is there a cost to employers to use the
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
so i think the answer is there's a cost
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
to everything
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
in the sense that it's an additional
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
layer of regulation
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
right the regulatory burden that 1.75
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
trillion dollars isn't necessarily it
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
costs our businesses 1.75 trillion
 
00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959 align:start position:0%
dollars but it's a time thing someone's
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
gonna have to
 
00:11:38.949 --> 00:11:38.959 align:start position:0%
be on staff to submit
 
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
everything right to deal with that it's
 
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
additional paperwork
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
so there is a small layer of regulatory
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
cluster that is going to impact
 
00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:49.590 align:start position:0%
cluster that is going to impact
businesses

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
just like every other regulation that we
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
put on businesses
 
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.269 align:start position:0%
put on businesses
follow-up

00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
but by the current statute the employers
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
are already required to obtain
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
documentation showing
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
the employee's eligibility ability to
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
work in the u.s correct
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
that's correct but e-verify
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
common sense way
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
to to deal with illegal immigration it's
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
a streamlined process that most
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
businesses already use and we're one of
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
the few states that does not have
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
mandatory e-verify so this is
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
essentially bringing new hampshire's
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
regulatory code up with this issue up
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
with many other states bringing it to
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
par does that make sense does that
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
um i want to say that's correct
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
a mental
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
no what is this sorry how do you
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
pimentel pimento it's
 
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.870 align:start position:0%
pimentel pimento it's
depends

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
taking my questions
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh i noticed in your opening remarks
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh gave a figure of i think 1.3 million
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants coming across the
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
southern border
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
and kind of a follow-up on a question
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
asked earlier
 
00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
do you know how many
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants there are in new
 
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:20.629 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants there are in new
hampshire

00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
so representative that was 1.9 million
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants that entered the
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
country um from the southern border last
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
year and that's an estimate of course
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
um from from border patrol so we don't
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
truly know the exact number um and how
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
many of those
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
remain in the united states
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to know with absolute
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
certainty but as you might know about 50
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
percent of illegal immigrants come from
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
folks that are overstaying their visa
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
so i would imagine that new hampshire
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that i'm aware of that
 
00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:00.629 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that i'm aware of that
would

00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
make us out of whack with that national
 
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.790 align:start position:0%
make us out of whack with that national
trend

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
trend
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
so i don't know the exact number of
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
illegal immigrants but i think most
 
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
people think the right number should be
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
zero in this state that's why i hear
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
from my constituents they want us to
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.079 --> 00:14:23.430 align:start position:0%
 
sullivan

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.230 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
could you explain exactly how e-verify
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
works and especially what the error rate
 
00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:33.990 align:start position:0%
works and especially what the error rate
is

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
um is for example is my name in the
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
e-verify system to verify that
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm here
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
properly and able to be employed i'm
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about someone who
 
00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:47.990 align:start position:0%
concerned about someone who
is

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
eligible to be employed might get
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
flagged by the e-verify system for some
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
reason so please explain how it works
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
well representative sullivan thanks for
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
the question uh e-verify works very
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
simply the same way any other background
 
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
check would work which is conducted
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
i'm a landlord for example so when we
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
screen tenants we do a background check
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
and any background check can have an
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
error rate that's just that's the way it
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
works it doesn't mean that we shouldn't
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
conduct a background check or we
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't conduct e-verify so of course
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to have false positives and
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
negatives that are you know wrong as
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
well that just comes along with with any
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
background check system so it's there
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
really isn't that much to it um it's as
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
simple as an answer i can give to you
 
00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:39.430 align:start position:0%
simple as an answer i can give to you
sir

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.590 align:start position:0%
sir
up

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
but you didn't really tell me how it
 
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:43.990 align:start position:0%
but you didn't really tell me how it
works

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
i just said it's like any other
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
background check but
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
is it a list of
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
names of illegal immigrants is a list of
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
names of uh citizens as well as uh legal
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh immigrants how does it work yeah so
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
let me try to be more specific
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative so
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
all any verified check is doing is
 
00:16:06.069 --> 00:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
running to see if someone's social
 
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
security number is accurate see if they
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
are a legal citizen in the united states
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
so they can check you have so for
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
example if i was going through an
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
e-verify check they'd say okay this is
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
my social security number yes he is a
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
legal citizen of the united states he's
 
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
good to go we're able to hire him that's
 
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:32.870 align:start position:0%
good to go we're able to hire him that's
it

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
and then to me and i'll keep going after
 
00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:36.470 align:start position:0%
and then to me and i'll keep going after
that

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
um i was just curious
 
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
is this a private company that
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
verify or is it a government company who
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh representative for
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.269 align:start position:0%
your question
um

00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
so an e-verify check you you're doing a
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
couple of things so who's actually
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
running the check
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
but then so like processing it but then
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
you have to check and see if someone is
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
a legal citizen so you're using that
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
social security number and ultimately
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
the government has that information
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
you you have to do both layers there
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
where you have to process it but then
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
you need the correct information so i
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
hope that answers your question
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
that it would it'd probably be a private
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
public partnership on that check there
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:37.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:37.830 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking another question
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
from me
 
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.990 align:start position:0%
from me
um

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
i i i'm guessing that this
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
is not going to be that easy to
 
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:47.750 align:start position:0%
is not going to be that easy to
implement

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
implement
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
maybe you can
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
tell me how this would work but
 
00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
i get the feeling just from what it is
 
00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.510 align:start position:0%
i get the feeling just from what it is
here

00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
just like when we go to vote
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
every new employee is going to have to
 
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.270 align:start position:0%
every new employee is going to have to
have

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
an e-verify no matter what
 
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.390 align:start position:0%
an e-verify no matter what
and

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.190 align:start position:0%
and
that

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
being said how do we make sure
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
that every employer
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
actually e-verifies
 
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.669 align:start position:0%
actually e-verifies
every

00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
prospective employee
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
what is what is the check and balance
 
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.070 align:start position:0%
what is what is the check and balance
here

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
so representative i just want to get
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
crystal clear on what you're asking the
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
question is how do we make sure
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
employers are in fact using e-verify for
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.150 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
representative

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
i i guess it's like anything else you
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
know i'm i'm a little perplexed
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
by the question
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
you're asking how do we like if you have
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
a law which we have in many different
 
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.029 align:start position:0%
a law which we have in many different
instances

00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
instances
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
how do we make sure that every school is
 
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
using a background check when we have
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
people that are working with children
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
right of course we would want
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
a teacher to have a background check
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
before they're working with little kids
 
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
how do we mandate that the school
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
requires the background check and that
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
they actually use it
 
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
i i'm not it's not any different than
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
that so i i'm perplexed as to
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
why that is a concern the same way that
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
we have ma mandates on lots of other
 
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.950 align:start position:0%
we have ma mandates on lots of other
things

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%

follow-up
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
go right ahead

want to make sure that i'm answering the
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
question for the members of the
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
committee but i'm just i'm going to take
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
a time out here
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
represent would you like to take your
 
00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:14.870 align:start position:0%
represent would you like to take your
seat

representative mitchell do you have a
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.070 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
uh

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:21.039 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman uh
 
00:20:21.039 --> 00:20:21.909 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman uh
uh

00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
my question is basically um a matter of
 
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.310 align:start position:0%
my question is basically um a matter of
fairness

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
fairness
 
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.990 align:start position:0%
fairness
uh

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.029 align:start position:0%
uh
i

00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:29.909 align:start position:0%
i
i

00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
i wonder whether or not
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
people are only going to use e-verify on
 
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.990 align:start position:0%
people are only going to use e-verify on
um

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
their prospective employees who have an
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
accent for instance
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
and not every single employee
 
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.230 align:start position:0%
and not every single employee
that

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
comes and applies for the job that is
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
your question to the presenter
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
yes it is all right thank you
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative for the
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
same as as i was saying if you were
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
conducting a background check on
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
teachers working with kids regardless of
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
someone's race gender age you have to
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
conduct the e-verify check it's very
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
important that's why that's why it
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
should be mandated because right now
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
when we don't have mandated e-verify
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
you're probably dealing with a situation
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
where it's more likely that an employer
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
might selectively run an e-verify check
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
this law would bring it up to par so all
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
all people that are being hired are
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
subject to that e-verify check which
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
isn't that intrusive but it's done
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
fairly to everyone
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
i see only one more here
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
representative for presenting um
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
as we know
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
rsa 275a has a penalty
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh section of 2500 per day for
 
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.510 align:start position:0%
uh section of 2500 per day for
violations

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
violations
 
00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.510 align:start position:0%
violations
um

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:59.669 --> 00:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
so my concern about
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
this um uh amendment to 275
 
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.190 align:start position:0%
this um uh amendment to 275
a4a

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
a4a
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
and the use of and
 
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.310 align:start position:0%
and the use of and
between

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
verifying through e-verify and obtaining
 
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.470 align:start position:0%
verifying through e-verify and obtaining
documentation

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
suggests that for example if someone
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
came in with what appeared to be
 
00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.990 align:start position:0%
came in with what appeared to be
legitimate

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.909 align:start position:0%
legitimate
um

00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
documentation such as a birth
 
00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
certificate or a social security card
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
and the employer did not
 
00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:29.110 align:start position:0%
and the employer did not
um

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
proceed with the e-verify system they
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
could be subjected to
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh the penalties under 275 a by virtue
 
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
of having failed to do that if the
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
documentation was
 
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.430 align:start position:0%
documentation was
not

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh legitimate not accurate
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
does does that possibility cause you any
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
concern or would you consider the idea
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
of making them in the disjunctive rather
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
well representative can you clarify the
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
question from me um
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
what you're saying just
 
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
you're saying if there's false
 
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.990 align:start position:0%
you're saying if there's false
documentation

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
documentation
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
meaning what exactly
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
no i'm going to interject here because
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
we got to get this thing moving you have
 
00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.149 align:start position:0%
we got to get this thing moving you have
and

00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
on line five
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
so you want to e-verify and all this
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
other documentation
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
in our law you have a 2500 fine
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
for violation plus a hundred dollars per
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
person per day
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
the question i believe is
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
go ahead now i answer your question
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
would that create
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
liabilities for potential liabilities
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
for companies that did due diligence but
 
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
not enough because they didn't pursue
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
both avenues and um
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
were therefore subject to penalty
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
for uh having failed to do one one part
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
of the other of those
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question uh
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
you know i appreciate the concern and i
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
do think that this bill is a step in the
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
right direction because
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
right now if we have businesses that are
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
not conducting an e-verify check
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
but they do hire an illegal immigrant
 
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
and very well could be by accident not
 
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.590 align:start position:0%
and very well could be by accident not
deliberately

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
deliberately
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
they are potentially liable because of
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
that so this is a way
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
for employees to say great i'm checking
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
the box i'm not hiring a legal immigrant
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
this is a step in the right direction
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate the concern
 
00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.909 align:start position:0%
but i appreciate the concern
representative

00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
i have one question
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
can you please tell me how many states
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
in the union you uh have mandatory
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
e-filing requirements
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
it's a majority of states i don't have
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
the exact number off the top of my head
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
mr representative avaloni
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
00:24:49.919 --> 00:24:54.470 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
um

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
would a business be mandated to
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
verify employment even after obtaining
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
documentation because to me it seems
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
that it's out of order as it's written
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
they should
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
no employer shall employ any employee
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
without obtaining documentation and
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
verifying employment
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
because you can't verify you use the
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
e-verify system without obtaining the
 
00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.510 align:start position:0%
e-verify system without obtaining the
documentation

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
seems a little bit out of order to me
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
so representative every business has to
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
conduct the e-verify check for employees
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
that they're hiring that's what the bill
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
does does that answer your question
 
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.870 align:start position:0%
does does that answer your question
representative

thank you
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's counter intuitive
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is maggie fogerty
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%

human rights around the world
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking on behalf of the new
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire immigrant rights network which
 
00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
is a statewide coalition of
 
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.510 align:start position:0%
is a statewide coalition of
organizations

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
individuals faith leaders attorneys who
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
are working together for
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
humane immigration policy certainly at
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
the federal level where immigration
 
00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
policy is set but also as uh
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
immigration-related issues impact our
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
state and even municipal
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh activities and we're here to urge you
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
to oppose hb
 
00:27:01.159 --> 00:27:02.789 align:start position:0%
to oppose hb
1124.

00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
1124.
 
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
uh this bill as you understand would
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily require every single
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
employer in new hampshire no matter the
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
size of the business to use the federal
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
e-verify system
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'm glad that the representative from
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
the department of labor is here to
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
answer some of the specific questions
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
that you've raised already i don't i'm
 
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
not an employment law expert or anything
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
like that simply an immigration
 
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.430 align:start position:0%
like that simply an immigration
advocate

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
the e-verify program was enacted in 1996
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
with the purpose of curbing the
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
employment of persons who aren't
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
eligible or authorized to work in the
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
united states
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
it's operated by the u.s citizenship and
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
immigration services
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
uscis which cross-checks the information
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
submitted by an employer with their own
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
database of
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
work authorization
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
currently 22 states not a majority 22
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
states have adopted mandatory e-verify
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
in the united states you'll see the list
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
of those states in the footnote of our
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
testimony which i will submit
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
however despite even
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
with 22 states adopting this the rate of
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
participation by businesses even in
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
those states is very low
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
in 2018 the department of homeland
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
security had enrolled 821
 
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
771 employers because you you create an
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
account you log in
 
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
in e-verify amounting to
 
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.909 align:start position:0%
in e-verify amounting to
13.5

00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
13.5
 
00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559 align:start position:0%
of all employers in the united states so
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
this means that 86.5 percent of u.s
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
employers refuse to use e-verify in
 
00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.710 align:start position:0%
employers refuse to use e-verify in
2018.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
2018.
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
although the error rates have improved
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
over the years the e-verify program has
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
caused harm to many people who are
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
authorized to work in the united states
 
00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
but because of maybe hyphenated names
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
complex names names that are frequently
 
00:29:00.159 --> 00:29:01.510 align:start position:0%
complex names names that are frequently
misspelled

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
misspelled
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
they are deemed to be ineligible by
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
their employer with an obvious
 
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
harm to the employer actively seeking
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
employees never more
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
intensely than now but certainly even
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
more acutely to the family relying on
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
that income for their basic well-being
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
and again that would be for harm done to
 
00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
authorized workers
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
in 2018 approximately 70 000 people
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
received erroneous eligibility
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
determinations and over the life of the
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
program since 1996 nearly three-quarters
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
of a million legal workers have been
 
00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:40.149 align:start position:0%
of a million legal workers have been
harmed

00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
harmed
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
the time to challenge an initial
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
determination of ineligibility
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
is very short it's only eight business
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
days and some applicants are neither
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
informed nor given an opportunity to
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
we believe that the e-verify program is
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
not necessary because of the broad and
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
heavily enforced requirement that all
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
employers submit the i-9 documentations
 
00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
as well so this would be an unnecessary
 
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.430 align:start position:0%
as well so this would be an unnecessary
overlay

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
overlay
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
we think that
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
creating a more coherent
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
immigration system in the united states
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
where there are clear pathways and
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
adequate resources to process people's
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
visa applications immigration benefit
 
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.710 align:start position:0%
visa applications immigration benefit
applications

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
applications
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
is much more worthy of our energy than
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
overlaying this
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
also employers frequently misunderstand
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
their obligations with regard to this
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
program and that increases their
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
liability for for penalties so they
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
could as has been mentioned
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
only use e-verify for those they
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
perceive to be non-citizens and that
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
certainly invites a claim of racial
 
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.269 align:start position:0%
certainly invites a claim of racial
profiling

00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
profiling
 
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
they can they often use it to pre-screen
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
potential employees which is not an
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
authorized use and then the applicant
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
never knows that they've been
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
denied work for a mistake
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
and they are also in error when they
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
fail to notify the employee when there's
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
been a negative determination
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
and there aren't any due process
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
protections written into the federally
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
verified law for an employee who is
 
00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.470 align:start position:0%
verified law for an employee who is
harmed

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
harmed
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
so for a state that understands itself
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
to be business friendly we don't see
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
this as adding anything to the equation
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
all employers can use e-verify if they
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
so choose
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
so the letter i'll submit to you today
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
is signed by 50 people who care about
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
this issue you'll see a diverse range of
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
towns and of organizational associations
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
take any questions you may have or to
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
just leave room for my colleagues to
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
speak representative proud
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you mentioned that
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
there was a limited time window to
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
challenge a negative determination does
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
the burden of challenging the negative
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
determination fall on the business or on
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
it would be the individual who
 
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:04.789 align:start position:0%
it would be the individual who
could

00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know correct
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
what the what they perceive the error to
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
be or to ask that the documentation be
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
resubmitted in a difference with a
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
so they would have to work in
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the business so both
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
would be involved because the business
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
would have to resubmit with a different
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
name so it would be a burden on both of
 
00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.190 align:start position:0%
name so it would be a burden on both of
them

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
it would if
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
yes but the all of the the i mean the
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
primary kind of consequence of that
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
erroneous determination is on the worker
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
then who wouldn't be
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
able to either start that job or
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question might an umlaut in
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
your name
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
make it difficult to correctly identify
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
your status yes absolutely
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
i just
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
purchased a plane ticket for my daughter
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
she has a hyphenated last name we had to
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
try six different times to confirm that
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
she was in the system uh and
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
so that was just a hyphen and an umlaut
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
would would would be a good example of
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
the kinds of problems that can surface
 
00:33:18.399 --> 00:33:20.230 align:start position:0%
the kinds of problems that can surface
beta

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
beta
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i guess i may not be uh up on
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
things what
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
did you say could be a problem what was
 
00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
the term you used
 
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's an umlaut it's two little dots
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
above a letter to adjust the
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
pronunciation thank you
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
i learned something new
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh it
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
seemed like you were pretty concerned
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
about false negatives false positives
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
and stuff
 
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:52.720 align:start position:0%
would you uh
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
would you find this bill a little more
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
palatable if we put in a grace period uh
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
you know 30 60 days whatever and in
 
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
order for somebody to to defend
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
themselves against
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
um if the bill is not necessary e-verify
 
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
is not necessary the i-9 process is very
 
00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
thorough and comes with all sorts of
 
00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:13.349 align:start position:0%
thorough and comes with all sorts of
weighty

00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
weighty
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
consequences for not complying so
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
e-verify doesn't accomplish anything
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
that the i-9
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh kind of follow
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
up to that question
 
00:34:27.359 --> 00:34:28.550 align:start position:0%
up to that question
um

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of the federal requirements on
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
e-verify are you isn't it the case that
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
those have the requirements are built
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
into the federal system when you
 
00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.430 align:start position:0%
into the federal system when you
register

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
register
 
00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.470 align:start position:0%
register
and

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
no state law can waive those federal
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
requirements are you referring to a
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
possible grace period etcetera right if
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
we wanted to
 
00:34:49.839 --> 00:34:50.869 align:start position:0%
we wanted to
mandate

00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
verify but somehow
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
present a gentler software yeah well i
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
that makes sense to me i won't pretend
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
to be an expert but that makes sense to
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
me that the program is already written
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
as it's written
 
00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.150 align:start position:0%
as it's written
sullivan

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
sullivan
 
00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um thank you for
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question the um
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not an employer so some of the stuff
 
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
is uh is new uh i9 is new to me could
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
you explain in detail what the i-9
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
document is
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
yes and i think i'll i'll be smartest to
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
defer to the representative from the
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
department of labor but uh as an
 
00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
employer i utilize the i-9 it's a form
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
you can download off of the
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's which federal
 
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
website it is and it requires there are
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
two columns of documentation that prove
 
00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:39.589 align:start position:0%
two columns of documentation that prove
someone's

00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
someone's
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
authorization to work so if you have
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
something from column one then you don't
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily need something from column
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
two but if you're if you have a document
 
00:35:47.839 --> 00:35:48.710 align:start position:0%
two but if you're if you have a document
from

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
column one that doesn't necessarily
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
establish a work authorization but shows
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
your identity then there would be a
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
second uh column of documents so
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
it is a it's a very standard part of any
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
employment process it's a a one-page
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
i have a few questions please
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
you said uh 22 states have enacted this
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
law have any of them have any states
 
00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.870 align:start position:0%
law have any of them have any states
repealed

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
that's a good question i don't know
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
that's under utilized in those states
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
according to the data that we have
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
are there any new england states that
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
have this law
 
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
that's a good question so the states are
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
alabama arizona colorado florida georgia
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
idaho indiana louisiana michigan
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
minnesota mississippi missouri nebraska
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
north carolina oklahoma pennsylvania
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
south carolina tennessee texas utah
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
virginia and west virginia so no no
 
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.750 align:start position:0%
virginia and west virginia so no no
states

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
in your testimony you use the term
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
humane immigration policies can you
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
please explain to me what a humane
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
immigration policy is and do you feel
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes i do feel this is not but humane
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
immigration policies
 
00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the stories that connect so
 
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
many of us to our our family's pathway
 
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
to the united states it acknowledges
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
that people are traveling migrating for
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
very wholesome reasons from economic
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity or love or
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
safety from violence or from economic
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
desperation in their own countries and
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
it creates a pathway where people can
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
fill out an up an application they'll
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
understand the conditions they get a
 
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.790 align:start position:0%
understand the conditions they get a
timely

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
timely
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
review of their case
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
it's not policies that are motivated by
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
for-profit prisons and for-profit
 
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
surveillance companies which drive so
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
much of the enforcement behavior that we
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
see and have seen for decades in the
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
country not just in the last few years
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
humane policies would also acknowledge
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
that when people come to our southern
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
border fleeing for their lives that we
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
don't just close the borders that we
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
have processes where their cases can be
 
00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.510 align:start position:0%
have processes where their cases can be
heard

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you are there any other

larger
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
national coalition and we're part of
 
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.109 align:start position:0%
national coalition and we're part of
this

00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
the organization that gave you the
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
letter that maggie just uh
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
read and distributed to you so i'm not
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
going to repeat uh some of the stuff
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
that you've heard
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
the fact is
 
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.390 align:start position:0%
the fact is
that

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
e-verify has not pro proven to work and
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
to deter
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants from working or
 
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
from being hired in states such as
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
arizona that was the first state
 
00:39:15.359 --> 00:39:16.230 align:start position:0%
arizona that was the first state
to

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
the first state to enact e-verify the
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
compliance is like 60 percent according
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
to the cato institute
 
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.670 align:start position:0%
to the cato institute
and

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
what happened was that the wages
 
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:29.670 align:start position:0%
what happened was that the wages
were

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
decreased for undocumented immigrants so
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
instead of deterring them
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
to to get employment they just doubled
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
up and they
 
00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
got additional jobs to supplement their
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
their income
 
00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
this is not going to put a stop and it's
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
not going to uh to employment of people
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
that are here without
 
00:39:52.079 --> 00:39:53.910 align:start position:0%
that are here without
authorization

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
the fact is that a lot of industries
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
depend on the hard labor of undocumented
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
agricultural the the the meat packing
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
places the you know and
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
what are they gonna do without their
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
employees right now we have a crisis
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
with the with the pandemic
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
i cannot tell you how many calls i get
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
every month
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
of employers looking to hire people
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%
because they're looking they cannot find
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
employees so this is going to hurt the
 
00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
businesses it's going to put an
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
additional burden on the small
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
businesses that are already hurting
 
00:40:35.670 --> 00:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
due to all these covered mess that we're
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
into it's going to put an additional
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
burden on them it's going to be costly
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
for them because they're going to have
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
to assign a person to to spend some time
 
00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.670 align:start position:0%
to assign a person to to spend some time
uh

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
learning the system
 
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.309 align:start position:0%
learning the system
and

00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know using it
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to be effective for
 
00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.990 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to be effective for
anything

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to subject the businesses to
 
00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.750 align:start position:0%
it's going to subject the businesses to
liability

00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
because a lot and this is not only to do
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
for um for citizens a lot of
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
non-citizens are illegal permanent
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
residents you know we work here i was i
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
before i became a citizen like 20 years
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
ago i worked for like
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know 15 years or so as a legal
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
permanent resident
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
and you know i wasn't a citizen but i
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
had the legal a legal right to work here
 
00:41:23.359 --> 00:41:24.630 align:start position:0%
had the legal a legal right to work here
so

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
the names is another mess
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
we in latin america we use both her
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
parents name so i'm eva del carmen
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
castillo stephanie this is my maiden
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
name and then when i married my husband
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
so he said castillo stephanie detergent
 
00:41:39.589 --> 00:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
so my my you know i came here on a
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
student visa in the 70s when they used
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
to give us uh social security numbers
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
and that's still the social security
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
number that i use now but that had i
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what combination of my names
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
previous to my married name
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
so you know it is it creates additional
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
burdens it burdens the businesses it
 
00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
burdens the the employees a a lot of
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
employees that get uh kicked out of the
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
system for something that they don't get
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
notified by the company because you know
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
why why bother there's another an
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
additional step to say hey you know what
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
you your your application didn't come uh
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
back correct they're not gonna bother so
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
these people are gonna go without jobs
 
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh it can potentially like i heard uh
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
the representative said you know
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
this composer an incentive for
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
just plainly dismissing people that look
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
or sound like me well if i keep my mouth
 
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
shut like i guess i could pass but you
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
know that that sound like me
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh or that look different so that could
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
pose you know present a potential
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
liability also so for all those reasons
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
and all the beautiful crafted letter
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
that we put together and with all the
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
reasons you know it really makes no
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
sense in new hampshire to do this to
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
mandate that in a state whose motto is
 
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
live free or die we do not need one more
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
regulation when we already have
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
protections uh for employers and we
 
00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
already have a way to verify who's
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
working here with what kind of documents
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%

00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
realize that that stuff goes on and i
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
realize that because i am a board member
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire coalition for
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
occupational safety and health for over
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
20 years and i volunteer for over 30
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
years to interpret at the department of
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
labor the workers come hearings because
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
they don't pay for interpreters so
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
i am boots on the ground and i can tell
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
you the horror stories of the abuse that
 
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
people the immigrant workers have
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh and endure just to keep a job i have
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
people that have had the the employers
 
00:44:58.079 --> 00:44:58.950 align:start position:0%
people that have had the the employers
so

00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
the cuts i have people that have cracked
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
their skull and been in uh been in coma
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
for six seven months with nothing i and
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
we had to pack him and send him like a
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
drag doll back home i cannot tell you i
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
mean over 30 years i've been doing this
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
so yes i am very aware of the abuses
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
that people endure in order to make a
 
00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.910 align:start position:0%
that people endure in order to make a
living

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
if implemented correctly
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't a knee verify system uh
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
help as far as uh as far as the ability
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
of an immigrant to be able to uh to to
 
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
report an employer that's that's
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
breaking all these laws the laws are
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
going to continue to be broken and the
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
fact is that as long as we like maggie
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
said before as long as we have a sub
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
class of people
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
that are continue to be preyed upon
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
because of their immigration status
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
these people are going to continue
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
hiring them and abusing them and workers
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
have no other choice than to work the
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
solution is not to put more barriers to
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
employment because people already are in
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
dire need to find employees
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
the solution is to pass a humane
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
immigration reform that would allow the
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
people that are here
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
without the proper authorization to earn
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
no questions thank you very much for
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%

i would like to to start by
giving

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
giving
 
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit of background on
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
immigration law
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
so the the first the first time that the
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
united states really
 
00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
started requiring and prohibiting other
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
people to come to the united states
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
was through the immigration act of 1924
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
that excluded certain individuals
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
from coming into this country
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
but the law wasn't really established
 
00:47:45.599 --> 00:47:46.829 align:start position:0%
but the law wasn't really established
until

00:47:46.829 --> 00:47:46.839 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:47:46.839 --> 00:47:48.390 align:start position:0%
until
1929

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
1929
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
which that was when
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
um the border patrol was established
 
00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.309 align:start position:0%
um the border patrol was established
today

00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
there that department is under the
 
00:47:59.190 --> 00:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
department of homeland security
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
known as customs and border patrol
 
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:04.069 align:start position:0%
known as customs and border patrol
so

00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
these individuals that came prior to
 
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:07.750 align:start position:0%
these individuals that came prior to
that

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
if we apply today's immigration law
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
these individuals would be
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
called or you know like some
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
some people state illegals
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
some of them would be deemed to
 
00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
to have a you know
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
ban called asylees which is someone who
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
files for an asylum application
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
and thankfully uh to the constitution of
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
the united states you would be you know
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
the babies granted u.s citizenship
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
through the 14th amendment
 
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
it is my opinion that this bill is
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
in violation of the constitution the the
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
reason being
 
00:48:51.119 --> 00:48:52.069 align:start position:0%
reason being
is

00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
because the state doesn't have the the
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
power to enforce
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh federal laws
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh the attempt that the tenth amendment
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
states that
 
00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
all the power that that has been granted
 
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.190 align:start position:0%
all the power that that has been granted
to

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:07.990 align:start position:0%
to
the

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
by the constitution or by federal law
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
deemed in the hands of the federal
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
government all the other powers should
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
be given to the states respectively and
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
to the people
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
so this law is a federal law that the
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is trying to to
 
00:49:31.839 --> 00:49:32.950 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is trying to to
pass

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
and some of you i bet you're thinking oh
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
yeah but we have 22 states that have
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
passed this legislation
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
but uh none of these states the law has
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
been challenged yet so
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
we don't know we don't know for sure
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
um the constituent constitutionality of
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
this law
 
00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:55.510 align:start position:0%
this law
so

00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
also as business owners i know uh some
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
of you are
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh do you really want uh the the state
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
to interfere with your ability of like
 
00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.870 align:start position:0%
to interfere with your ability of like
livelihood

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
livelihood
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
telling you what you should and should
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
not do with your own business
 
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
as a business owner
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
as i have stated um you know like
 
00:50:19.119 --> 00:50:20.390 align:start position:0%
as i have stated um you know like
immigration

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh has not been changed much immigration
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
loss has not been changed much
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
from many many years and unfortunately
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
it hasn't followed the the current
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
moment that we're seeing
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
as you all know we have a lot of
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
employers that want people
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh to to work
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
but they cannot find anybody and i can
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
speak to you uh from you know the
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
immigrant community they're actually
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
they're scrambling you know to to find
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
jobs because in the immigrant community
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
it has been so difficult for for them to
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
actually get jobs because the typical
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
jobs that immigrants perform are the
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
jobs that no americans want to do
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
cleaning toilets constructions
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
plowing snow uh landscaping and uh so
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
forth so it is very you know like
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
difficult especially during the winter
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
during covid a lot of families are
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
struggling to
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
find jobs because of many circumstances
 
00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
out of the control
 
00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.309 align:start position:0%
out of the control
so

00:51:26.309 --> 00:51:26.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
in addition we have many many many what
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
we call
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
mixed families mixed families which uh
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
someone in the family either the father
 
00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
or the mother
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
most of the time the father
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
that is undocumented we don't use the
 
00:51:45.839 --> 00:51:46.710 align:start position:0%
that is undocumented we don't use the
term

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
um illegal so the term illegal so you
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
all understand is the equivalent to the
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
n word
 
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
so we don't use that that term
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
so the father is typically undocumented
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
the mother is a u.s citizen and they
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
have a u.s citizen child
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
so if the father is not able to to get
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
work the mother has to take care of the
 
00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.109 align:start position:0%
work the mother has to take care of the
child

00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh who's gonna pay the the bills uh you
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
know the the mothers typically uh
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
especially immigrant families they don't
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
like to seek out for for help even
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
though they have a u.s citizen because
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
they're always afraid that it might have
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
a consequence on the undocumented
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
immigrant in the family so it is a very
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
complicated uh situation uh immigration
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
is not easy i'm sure you all see the
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
calls for immigration reform in the news
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much every day it's because it's
 
00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
so convoluted not even us immigration
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
attorneys are really understanding
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
because it changes daily so it's hard to
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
keep up
 
00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.200 align:start position:0%
but i urge you to vote against this bill
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%

00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
reinforce
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
the idea that it's it's no longer
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
acceptable to use the term illegals it's
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
not in the text of the bill
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
from what i've read
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
um i see undocumented that's an
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
acceptable term
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
um but i heard a gentleman earlier
 
00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.589 align:start position:0%
um but i heard a gentleman earlier
testifying

00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
using this term and
 
00:54:13.359 --> 00:54:14.630 align:start position:0%
using this term and
illegals

00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
illegals
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
is not acceptable at a time when this
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
country is
 
00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:22.090 align:start position:0%
going through a racial equity reckoning
 
00:54:22.090 --> 00:54:23.349 align:start position:0%
going through a racial equity reckoning
[Music]

00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
also uh people that are undocumented can
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
become documented with some federal
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
immigration reform
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
so let's retire that term that's my
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
first point
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
um secondly i want to say that
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
this bill is bad for people
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
for families
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
for livelihoods and for communities
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
i'm um
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
i'm the head of a household of a mixed
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
status family that mr bruno referred to
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm a u.s citizen
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
um my
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
several years ago on a student visa
 
00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:11.270 align:start position:0%
several years ago on a student visa
and

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
we've been trying to change his status
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
from a student
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
to a legal permanent resident for about
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
two years now
 
00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.349 align:start position:0%
two years now
and

00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
during that time
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
we've had a child
 
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
and our baby is now one years old and
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
we're still waiting for his work
 
00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.309 align:start position:0%
we're still waiting for his work
permission

00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
permission
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
we're still waiting for a green card
 
00:55:34.559 --> 00:55:35.349 align:start position:0%
we're still waiting for a green card
and

00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
that means that he's undocumented
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
he doesn't have status
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
but does he have a right to be here of
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
course he does
 
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.549 align:start position:0%
course he does
um

00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
he's also a young man who's ready to
 
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:50.950 align:start position:0%
he's also a young man who's ready to
work

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
he's uh he's young he's able-bodied he
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
has great skills he's educated
 
00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.670 align:start position:0%
has great skills he's educated
and

00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:59.190 align:start position:0%
and
there

00:55:59.190 --> 00:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
there there's not a possibility for him
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
to work right now
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
i expect that he'll go through a
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
background check
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
when it's time for him to get hired or
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
when he finds a job
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
but i can't understand why it would be
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
necessary to
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
perform a background check that requires
 
00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.349 align:start position:0%
perform a background check that requires
reporting

00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:23.599 align:start position:0%
him to the federal government
 
00:56:23.599 --> 00:56:26.069 align:start position:0%
him to the federal government
um

00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
finally i just want to i want to you
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
know confide kind of personally
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm the sole provider at the moment
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
um i'm a i'm i'm a mom i i work nine to
 
00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.109 align:start position:0%
um i'm a i'm i'm a mom i i work nine to
five

00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
um occasionally we we have to send our
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
child to daycare
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
people in new hampshire also have a hard
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
time getting a driver's license so to
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
add on top of that difficulty of not
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
you know not having that extra financial
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
support from my husband
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
he also
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
is not allowed to to drive
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
you know so you can just imagine all of
 
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
the um stress
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
and financial burden that falls on women
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
like me it's like being a single parent
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
so he's just been undocumented and
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
waiting for two years other families
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
have been waiting for you know much
 
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
longer to get to get status here
 
00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
why should we take away people's
 
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.829 align:start position:0%
why should we take away people's
livelihoods

00:57:52.839 --> 00:57:54.390 align:start position:0%
there's job wanted signs
everywhere

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
my husband can't apply for any of those
 
00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:57.990 align:start position:0%
my husband can't apply for any of those
jobs

00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
services will go unprovided
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
and the economy will subsequently be
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
affected even more by this pandemic so
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
why should we make it more difficult to
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
finally i think that it's important that
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
we leave enforcement of immigration
 
00:58:23.910 --> 00:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
and perhaps one of the solutions to this
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
problem is reforming our federal
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
immigration policies and making it
 
00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
easier for people to immigrate legally
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
including you know pathway to
 
00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
citizenship for
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
undocumented people and uh
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
holders of
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
dreamers tps
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
refugees let's be proactive about
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
immigration rather than reacting in this
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
way so until our immigration system is
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
reformed i think there's a better way
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
especially in a live free or die state
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
rather than putting more restrictions so
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
i'm urging you all respective
 
00:59:02.559 --> 00:59:03.750 align:start position:0%
i'm urging you all respective
respect

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%

mr ross i think you don't you have any
 
00:59:27.589 --> 00:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
testimony or you just want to answer
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
questions uh i just wanted to announce
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
myself that i'm present for any
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone's available that
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
everyone has
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
the department has no position with
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
respect to the bill we understand it as
 
00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.230 align:start position:0%
respect to the bill we understand it as
written

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
we do find it would make it easier for
 
00:59:42.549 --> 00:59:42.559 align:start position:0%
us to enforce our statutes
 
00:59:50.230 --> 00:59:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
thank you to the dol rep um
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
could you explain to us how the hiring
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
process works for employers employers
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
are required to get i-9 employees are
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
required to file with the state within a
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
certain amount of time and if the
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
process isn't met what happens to those
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
employers when they're found under audit
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
so they're not required to file it with
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
the state they're required to retain it
 
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
in their possession for the duration of
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
the employment and an additional three
 
01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.230 align:start position:0%
the employment and an additional three
years

01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
so during an audit we would ask the
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
employer to present the uh the
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
documentation the proof of the
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
documentation to work the i9s and then
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
we would look at it
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
and just make sure that they had it on
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
file um
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
so that so and if they do not have it on
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
file it is
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
the employer is subject to up to twenty
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollar penalty so it's not
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
an instant twenty five hundred dollars
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
but up to zero to twenty five hundred
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
plus an additional up to one hundred
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
dollars per day per employee for the
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
duration of the violation
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh usually the duration of the time that
 
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
the work was done uh most of the time we
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
come up upon this situation is
 
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.789 align:start position:0%
come up upon this situation is
construction

01:00:56.789 --> 01:00:56.799 align:start position:0%
construction
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's where we're seeing an issue with
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
the undocumented workers or fraudulently
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
documented workers
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
and they are often paid less than the
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
documented workers and we are seeing
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
less protections for them as previously
 
01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:15.349 align:start position:0%
less protections for them as previously
testified

01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
thank you so when you come across that
 
01:01:17.599 --> 01:01:19.349 align:start position:0%
thank you so when you come across that
um

01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
undocumented workers
 
01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:22.870 align:start position:0%
undocumented workers
with

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
fraudulent documentation um
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
the employer is responsible
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
for that for taking that fraudulent
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
information and hiring them as employees
 
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's tricky um so the issue is and i'm
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
not sure if e-verify is going to be the
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
answer either so um but so the how the
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
we understand the law because we come
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
upon it
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
is the employer is not expected to be an
 
01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
expert in um the documentation but they
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
are subject to potential penalties if it
 
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.029 align:start position:0%
are subject to potential penalties if it
was

01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
so obviously fraudulent that it was you
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
know it airs on the side of negligence
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
the pictures don't match the date of
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
births are off the fonts weird
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
on the fraudulent documentation so um i
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
think you know it's our understanding
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
from you verify that it may take some of
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
the mystery out of it for the employer
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
so that they're not um
 
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
entering into that liability that
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
questioning on us on our part it adds an
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
easier step of due diligence um where um
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
we did have one recently where the
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
pictures just
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
just didn't look right
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
everyone looked like they had glamour
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
shots uh in the documentation that we
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
saw um
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
so you know that it takes something so
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
the decide that you know the deciding
 
01:02:39.349 --> 01:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
factor upon the department is whether or
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
not we're going to try to hold the
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
employer accountable should that
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
employer have known better from their
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
review of the documentation
 
01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
now e verify i don't believe would have
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
i think it's you know it's a
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
government-run um website
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
in which it would be an easy check for
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
the employer to determine whether or not
 
01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um unemployment
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
securities requires us to
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
file with them within two weeks of
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
hiring a person if that information
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
comes back
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
sorry i wasn't aware of employment
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
security does so department labor
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't require filing with us so i want
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
to clarify that yep
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
employment securities requires two weeks
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
for a new employee um what if that
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
as an employer issue took the wrong
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
information again fraudulent issue the
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
dol walks in the door and does an audit
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
on that employer because es
 
01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
flagged it
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
how does that work for the employer
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
the employer knew it was fraudulent and
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
continued to operate um so that would be
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
a question for us to determine through
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
and it would be through the
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
investigation whether or not the
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
employer should have known um if they
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
continued to operate after employment
 
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
security flagged it for them and
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
informed them that it was that the
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
documentation was fraudulent
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and it would go through the hearing
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
process if we couldn't reach an informal
 
01:04:05.359 --> 01:04:08.069 align:start position:0%
process if we couldn't reach an informal
settlement

01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
are called any other
 
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.190 align:start position:0%
questions for
us

01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%

my mother's mad at me because we're not
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
all right all right

while i go testify
 
01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.710 align:start position:0%
while i go testify
against

01:05:36.710 --> 01:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
i am andrew prout representing
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county district 37 the
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
towns of hudson and pelham
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
this bill would repeal the granite state
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
family leave plan that was inserted into
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 the budget trailer bill
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
as we all know the budget process last
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
year introduced many policy changes and
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
i disagree with this one
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
while the program was sold as a
 
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary private insurance plan it is
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
100 taxpayer funded for the 11 000 state
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
employees covered by it
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
this cost is not guaranteed to stay
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
within the rosy forecast predicted by
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
its proponents
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
and the taxpayers will be on the hook
 
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
for the increased costs when the
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
contract comes up for renewal
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
private insurance similar to this
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
offering is already available and costs
 
01:06:40.549 --> 01:06:40.559 align:start position:0%
much more
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
this will also affect county municipal
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
and school budgets
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
you may look at the bill and what passed
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
an hb2 and think
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
and think that you don't see where it
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
does that
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
but it should be obvious that an
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
unnegotiated free gift to state
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
employees will not go unnoticed by
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
county and local government employees
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
this program will metastasize
 
01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:01.750 align:start position:0%
this program will metastasize
and

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
then it will grow
 
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
as previously stated
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
local governments will be left holding
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
when the costs on this program increase
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
not if but when
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
there will be calls to make the program
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
mandatory to explain away these
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
increased costs by selective enrollment
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
i predict the insurance companies
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
issuing contracts under the state
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
program will be at the forefront of
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
these arguments
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
what better way to drive more business
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
to them
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
unlike unlike how other states have
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
implemented this idea as a
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
government-operated program we've set
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
the stage for crony capitalism
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
we've set the stage for an army of
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
lobbyists and campaign contributions to
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
make sure the program never changes
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
is never reformed and the overhead costs
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
pocketed by these companies are never
 
01:07:50.799 --> 01:07:53.190 align:start position:0%
pocketed by these companies are never
audited

01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
audited
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
we don't need programs like this for
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
companies offer great benefits to their
 
01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.510 align:start position:0%
companies offer great benefits to their
employees

01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
we're in one of the most severe labor
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
shortages companies are offering a
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
myriad of incentives to hire retained
 
01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.470 align:start position:0%
myriad of incentives to hire retained
employees

01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
some do do this with better benefits
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
some do it with higher base salaries
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
it varies from industry to industry and
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
employer to employer as it should
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
government involvement will only make
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
the situation worse as i've experienced
 
01:08:18.239 --> 01:08:19.510 align:start position:0%
the situation worse as i've experienced
myself

01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
i work in massachusetts where they've
 
01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
recently implemented
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
family medical leave insurance program
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
and my work decided they couldn't meet
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
the new requirements on minimum accrual
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
accrual rate tracking usage and all the
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
other regulatory burdens under the new
 
01:08:36.309 --> 01:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
terms of the new fmli plan
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
which they actually had a waiver from
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
because they already had a similar
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
benefit but not from the reporting
 
01:08:40.719 --> 01:08:42.550 align:start position:0%
benefit but not from the reporting
requirements

01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
so to meet these new rules they reduced
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
the sick leave benefits available to
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
employees that have been in place for
 
01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.390 align:start position:0%
employees that have been in place for
decades

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
decades
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
a real life example of of making things
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
equal in the way described in kurt
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
vogel's story harrison bergeron
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
as we all know once the program is
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
implemented the chance of a repeal
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
becomes unrealistic it will only grow
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
like all government freebies the time to
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
address the problem is now
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your time
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
consideration and i'd be happy to take
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
i have one
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
do you have any information on the
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
status of implementation
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
since this went into the budget bill
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
what has happened at the state level so
 
01:09:28.719 --> 01:09:30.470 align:start position:0%
what has happened at the state level so
far

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
i do not know precisely where
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh the department of i think it's in
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
insurance is in issuing the contract i
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
know they have begun discussions but i
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
also know that the contract has not yet
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
been issued and i know it has not yet
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
been gone to the governor and council
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any any other questions for
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
the representative
 
01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.510 align:start position:0%
the representative
yes

01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
representative i'm just wondering i
 
01:10:07.750 --> 01:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't really part of the sausage making
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
and hb2 i'm wondering do you have any
 
01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.790 align:start position:0%
and hb2 i'm wondering do you have any
historical

01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
historical
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge of just how this
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
made it into hb2
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that it was not in the
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
version of hp 2 that left the house
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
and it was part of the
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
senate hearing process that inserted it
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
and then in the committee conference it
 
01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:32.790 align:start position:0%
and then in the committee conference it
was

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh i believe one of the last items to be
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:41.679 --> 01:10:42.830 align:start position:0%
thank you
further

01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
next up i have a card from amanda sears
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
she is representing the campaign for a
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
getting back into the habit of this
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
 
01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:17.910 align:start position:0%
sorry about that
um

01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
so good morning my name is amanda sears
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
am the director of the campaign for a
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
family-friendly economy a paid family in
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
medical leave is important for workers
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
and businesses in the economy and the
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
kovid 19 pandemic has only underscored
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
the value of having a system for
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
ensuring people can take the time they
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
need for medical emergencies without
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
putting their financial security at risk
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
but the governor's program to
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
artificially prop up a private insurance
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
provider is not an effective paid leave
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
program that meets the needs of granite
 
01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.990 align:start position:0%
program that meets the needs of granite
staters

01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
staters
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
what the legislature should do here is
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
repeal this program and replace it with
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
one that covers all working people
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
so we would be in support of an amended
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
version of this bill that would repeal
 
01:12:03.910 --> 01:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
and replace the program currently in
 
01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.669 align:start position:0%
and replace the program currently in
statute

01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
as a result of having no public hearings
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
surrounding passage of this program
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
there are many problems with this
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
program and many gaps in information
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
about access cost implications etc which
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
would really should really be considered
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
the governor's program entirely leaves
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
out a path for employees at companies
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
with less than 50 employees to access
 
01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
this benefit if their employer doesn't
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
choose to offer it and about 40 percent
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire workers are employed in
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
these settings
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
these employees are already far less
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
likely to have access to paid leave and
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
are left out of the individual market
 
01:12:39.199 --> 01:12:40.390 align:start position:0%
are left out of the individual market
entirely

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
unless their employer decides to opt in
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
and cover the whole staff
 
01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
if they do that employer gets the
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
competitive advantage of saying they
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
offer this benefit
 
01:12:50.470 --> 01:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
and they'll enjoy a publicly subsidized
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
rate and or tax credits but they don't
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
have any disincentive to deny employees
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
from taking leave when they need it
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
and they can retaliate against or fire
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
employees who try to take this publicly
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
subsidized benefit
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh there's also a bunch of questions
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
about people who work for multiple
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
employers and if you work for one
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
employer of over 50 and one employer
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's smaller that doesn't
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
qualify for the individual market and i
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
think that you know that might open the
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
state up to legal challenges about
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
discriminating against residents ability
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
to access this publicly subsidized
 
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:22.950 align:start position:0%
to access this publicly subsidized
program

01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
because of the size of the company
 
01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
they're employed by
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies have a lot of
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
control with this program over cost of
 
01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.590 align:start position:0%
control with this program over cost of
premiums

01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
premiums
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
rate setting denial of claims and
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's no process outlined for appeals
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
of denied claims or even jurisdiction
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
indicating who would be responsible for
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
those appeals
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
and private insurers already control so
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
many of our health care decisions we
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
would now be trusting them to decide
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
when and whether we can provide care to
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
our loved ones with this program
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
there's no consideration in this policy
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
several operational questions like if an
 
01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
employer purchases independent coverage
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
for medical leave but the employer fails
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
to grant the employee time off
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
or what if the employer recognizes the
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
need for time off but the individ
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
independent insurer denies coverage how
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
are these disputes resolved
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
the state would be acting as a
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
collections agency for this private
 
01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
insurer that's chosen
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
and i've noticed i've not seen any legal
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
opinions on whether it's okay for the
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
state to charge low-income people
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the individual pool the same premiums
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
as high-income earners but to provide
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
them with significantly different
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
benefits because how this would work is
 
01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.390 align:start position:0%
benefits because how this would work is
that

01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know somebody who's a 130 000 a
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
dollar a year worker would pay the same
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
would pay the state up to five dollars a
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
week the same amount that a 12 an hour
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
worker would pay but these two people
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
would get wildly different benefits
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
based upon what their wages are
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
there's also a bunch of other questions
 
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
and probably don't have time to get into
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
but could answer
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
bring them up and then this is going to
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
have a significant revenue impact for
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
the state that hasn't been considered
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
and that are not based upon a
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
consideration of how many people will
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
actually newly get this benefit
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know if if we had 30 percent of
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
employers in the state take advantage of
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
that that's about a third of our
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
workforce a third of our workforce
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
already has access to this benefit so
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
you could have a third of our workforce
 
01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it take a 30 million
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
dollar hit to the state budget and not
 
01:15:21.990 --> 01:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
have a single new person have access to
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
this benefit than has it right now
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line is
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
the reason that there's been a demand
 
01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:30.640 align:start position:0%
for state policy for paid leave is
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
because two-thirds of working people
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't have it
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
and there's significant disparity
 
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
between who has it and who doesn't
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
and the people least likely to have paid
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
leave are working people with the lowest
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
incomes and the most significant
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
caregiving responsibilities public
 
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
policy should be used to eliminate that
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
disparity this does not guarantee that
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
we do that
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make a commitment uh to
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we working people who have
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
paid leave will have paid leave when
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
they need it
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
and it artificially props up a private
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
insurance market without making any
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
commitment to ensure that people can
 
01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
take the leave that they're that they
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
are paying for with this program

what this bill
 
03:02:18.550 --> 03:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
will do in a nutshell
 
03:02:21.269 --> 03:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
it will tie unemployment duration
 
03:02:23.990 --> 03:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
to an unemployment rate
 
03:02:25.830 --> 03:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
that will get folks back to work on an
 
03:02:27.990 --> 03:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
average twice as fast
 
03:02:29.670 --> 03:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
it will strengthen the state's trust
 
03:02:29.680 --> 03:02:30.389 align:start position:0%
it will strengthen the state's trust
fund

03:02:30.389 --> 03:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:02:31.910 --> 03:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
over time
 
03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
and over time it will will or should
 
03:02:36.710 --> 03:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
reduce taxes on businesses allowing
 
03:02:39.510 --> 03:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
those businesses to either increase pay
 
03:02:44.070 --> 03:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
expand benefits or expand their business
 
03:02:46.469 --> 03:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
the way this bill will work it will
 
03:02:46.479 --> 03:02:47.510 align:start position:0%
the way this bill will work it will
index

03:02:47.510 --> 03:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
index
 
03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:48.309 align:start position:0%
index
the

03:02:48.309 --> 03:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:02:50.389 --> 03:02:50.399 align:start position:0%
amount of time on unemployment
 
03:02:53.429 --> 03:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
collecting unemployment insurance to the
 
03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
current rate of unemployment in the
 
03:02:54.880 --> 03:02:55.910 align:start position:0%
current rate of unemployment in the
state

03:02:55.910 --> 03:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:02:57.830 --> 03:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
the bottom number on this will be any
 
03:02:59.670 --> 03:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
time that the st states unemployment
 
03:03:02.469 --> 03:03:02.479 align:start position:0%
rate is below five percent
 
03:03:04.309 --> 03:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
the unemployment benefit
 
03:03:06.950 --> 03:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
will be 12 weeks which just happens to
 
03:03:08.389 --> 03:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
be at this time
 
03:03:10.870 --> 03:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
point of time 12 weeks is the average
 
03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
that a an individual
 
03:03:16.230 --> 03:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:18.790 --> 03:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
an additional one week will be added for
 
03:03:20.550 --> 03:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
each half percent
 
03:03:22.710 --> 03:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
increase in the unemployment rate up to
 
03:03:25.830 --> 03:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
a maximum of 20 weeks
 
03:03:28.150 --> 03:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
again common sense legislation
 
03:03:30.070 --> 03:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh the unemployment benefits should last
 
03:03:31.910 --> 03:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
longer when unemployment rates are high
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
and they should be lower when
 
03:03:36.550 --> 03:03:36.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment employment rates are low
 
03:03:40.950 --> 03:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
over time as we as i mentioned this will
 
03:03:43.910 --> 03:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
increase the solvency of our
 
03:03:47.269 --> 03:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:48.630 --> 03:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of the
 
03:03:51.990 --> 03:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:54.790 --> 03:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
in this case florida i sent you all a
 
03:03:56.550 --> 03:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
extensive white paper on florida and
 
03:03:59.030 --> 03:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
their results north carolina georgia
 
03:04:01.349 --> 03:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
are 84 percent more solvent than the
 
03:04:03.429 --> 03:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
standard states
 
03:04:05.429 --> 03:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
interesting in that paper i sent you to
 
03:04:05.439 --> 03:04:06.790 align:start position:0%
interesting in that paper i sent you to
florida

03:04:06.790 --> 03:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
florida
 
03:04:08.630 --> 03:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
when they first implemented this reform
 
03:04:10.710 --> 03:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
their trust fund was um
 
03:04:12.070 --> 03:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
in the hole by
 
03:04:14.469 --> 03:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
1.7 billion dollars
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's currently at 3.9 billion dollars a
 
03:04:18.910 --> 03:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
net increase of a
 
03:04:22.309 --> 03:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
5.6 billion swing and their unemployment
 
03:04:24.389 --> 03:04:24.399 align:start position:0%
insurance rate is
 
03:04:26.150 --> 03:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
about the lowest in the country at point
 
03:04:26.160 --> 03:04:31.110 align:start position:0%
about the lowest in the country at point
one

03:04:31.110 --> 03:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:32.950 --> 03:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
a couple of things this will do
 
03:04:35.510 --> 03:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
not only will it help businesses
 
03:04:37.190 --> 03:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
but it will help
 
03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:38.710 align:start position:0%
but it will help
individuals

03:04:38.710 --> 03:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
03:04:40.950 --> 03:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
who are unemployed it's more likely that
 
03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
they uh when individuals are unemployed
 
03:04:46.710 --> 03:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
they fall into a longer term dependency
 
03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
and it becomes harder to find work
 
03:04:51.429 --> 03:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:04:54.070 --> 03:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
studies have always shown that receiving
 
03:04:55.510 --> 03:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
the unemployment benefits for an
 
03:04:56.870 --> 03:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
extended amount of time can reduce
 
03:04:59.190 --> 03:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
unemployed workers job search efforts
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
decreasing their likelihood of becoming
 
03:05:02.950 --> 03:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
re-employed i think we've seen over the
 
03:05:04.389 --> 03:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
last two years an
 
03:05:07.349 --> 03:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
excellent example of what happens uh the
 
03:05:08.790 --> 03:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
longer that you
 
03:05:10.469 --> 03:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
give individuals
 
03:05:12.469 --> 03:05:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh unemployment the longer they they
 
03:05:15.510 --> 03:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
tend to stay on um
 
03:05:17.750 --> 03:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
on unemployment we saw this particularly
 
03:05:19.269 --> 03:05:19.279 align:start position:0%
last spring
 
03:05:20.870 --> 03:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
when the federal government was still
 
03:05:22.870 --> 03:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
handing out 300 a week
 
03:05:24.550 --> 03:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment checks
 
03:05:24.560 --> 03:05:25.269 align:start position:0%
unemployment checks
and

03:05:25.269 --> 03:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:05:27.990 --> 03:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
they asked us governor sununu would he
 
03:05:29.190 --> 03:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
continue that
 
03:05:31.510 --> 03:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment check of 300 a week and he
 
03:05:32.469 --> 03:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
said yes
 
03:05:34.309 --> 03:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
it was very short period of time a
 
03:05:36.790 --> 03:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
couple weeks later that he reversed that
 
03:05:39.110 --> 03:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that was a on because a lot of the
 
03:05:41.910 --> 03:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
business and business groups said hey we
 
03:05:43.990 --> 03:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
can't find employees we need that to end
 
03:05:46.070 --> 03:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
and by reducing that you can see where
 
03:05:47.349 --> 03:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
we are today
 
03:05:48.950 --> 03:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the two percent range for
 
03:05:48.960 --> 03:05:56.790 align:start position:0%
in the two percent range for
unemployment

03:05:56.790 --> 03:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:59.830 --> 03:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
as we were just talking about we are
 
03:06:01.910 --> 03:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
suffering a worker shortage at this time
 
03:06:03.910 --> 03:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
we need more workers not extended
 
03:06:06.550 --> 03:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
welfare or
 
03:06:11.910 --> 03:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
the last numbers that i have show that
 
03:06:16.710 --> 03:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
as a total percent of
 
03:06:18.870 --> 03:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
wages the unemployment tax rate in new
 
03:06:21.030 --> 03:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire is 0.47
 
03:06:23.910 --> 03:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
which is good state
 
03:06:23.920 --> 03:06:25.269 align:start position:0%
which is good state
countrywide

03:06:25.269 --> 03:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
countrywide
 
03:06:27.269 --> 03:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
but you compare that to florida at point
 
03:06:30.389 --> 03:06:30.399 align:start position:0%
one that's almost five times less
 
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
georgia is currently 0.22
 
03:06:36.550 --> 03:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
north carolina 0.39 and even maine
 
03:06:39.190 --> 03:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
who is not doing indexing at the time
 
03:06:45.590 --> 03:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:48.550 --> 03:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:50.630 --> 03:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
couple word changes that i will be
 
03:06:53.110 --> 03:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
introducing amendment
 
03:06:55.269 --> 03:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
on later
 
03:06:57.990 --> 03:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
that those were recommended by
 
03:07:00.389 --> 03:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
the deputy commissioner
 
03:07:01.670 --> 03:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:07:03.110 --> 03:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to put that forward now in
 
03:07:05.030 --> 03:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
case there were any other changes that
 
03:07:06.550 --> 03:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
may come forward
 
03:07:08.790 --> 03:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
basically it was just some clarification
 
03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
on the second paragraph b
 
03:07:13.990 --> 03:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
where we take the snapshot how we take
 
03:07:19.590 --> 03:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:20.950 --> 03:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
so in closing
 
03:07:23.110 --> 03:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
again this is a rational responsible
 
03:07:25.349 --> 03:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
common sense legislation shorter term
 
03:07:27.269 --> 03:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
payments when unemployment rates are
 
03:07:28.950 --> 03:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
high and
 
03:07:31.030 --> 03:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
longer term payments when unemployment
 
03:07:33.750 --> 03:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
rates are high and shorter when they low
 
03:07:36.070 --> 03:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately this will save businesses
 
03:07:38.230 --> 03:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance taxes those can
 
03:07:39.910 --> 03:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
be used for the benefit employees or
 
03:07:41.830 --> 03:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
expanding businesses
 
03:07:43.429 --> 03:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
and as we said we learned during the
 
03:07:45.670 --> 03:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
last couple years that
 
03:07:45.680 --> 03:07:46.389 align:start position:0%
last couple years that
a

03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:07:47.990 --> 03:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
segment of our population tends to
 
03:07:49.990 --> 03:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
remain idle when monthly payments in new
 
03:07:51.510 --> 03:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire at one time had a high of
 
03:07:54.790 --> 03:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
thirty six hundred dollars a month
 
03:07:56.469 --> 03:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
and the final point i'll make is there
 
03:07:59.349 --> 03:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
is no financial downside to this fiscal
 
03:07:59.359 --> 03:08:00.469 align:start position:0%
is no financial downside to this fiscal
downside

03:08:00.469 --> 03:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
downside
 
03:08:02.309 --> 03:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
there's only upside for this
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd be happy to take any
 
03:08:03.840 --> 03:08:07.510 align:start position:0%
and with that i'd be happy to take any
questions

03:08:07.510 --> 03:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:09.030 --> 03:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative warden you recognize your
 
03:08:09.040 --> 03:08:09.910 align:start position:0%
representative warden you recognize your
question

03:08:09.910 --> 03:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:08:12.070 --> 03:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:08:13.670 --> 03:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
maybe you're going to just address this
 
03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment but in paragraph 2 line 10
 
03:08:23.590 --> 03:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
of the proposed bill you say uh how to
 
03:08:25.590 --> 03:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
identify or
 
03:08:27.269 --> 03:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
define the state average unemployment
 
03:08:27.279 --> 03:08:28.870 align:start position:0%
define the state average unemployment
rate

03:08:28.870 --> 03:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
rate
 
03:08:30.150 --> 03:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
and the way i read it it looks like the
 
03:08:32.469 --> 03:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
three months for the most recent third
 
03:08:35.110 --> 03:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
quarter so quarter three of the calendar
 
03:08:37.349 --> 03:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
year average of those three months means
 
03:08:38.950 --> 03:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
you can only addressed it once a year
 
03:08:42.230 --> 03:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct um i'm sure
 
03:08:44.150 --> 03:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh deputy commissioner
 
03:08:45.830 --> 03:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
lavers will be happy to come up and
 
03:08:49.429 --> 03:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
explain exactly as i said that um
 
03:08:52.309 --> 03:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
starting online time 10 we we've
 
03:08:55.110 --> 03:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
discussed this and he suggested um a
 
03:08:56.950 --> 03:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
couple changes to that
 
03:08:58.309 --> 03:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
when he comes up if you would ask him
 
03:08:59.830 --> 03:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
that question he will be able to answer
 
03:09:01.750 --> 03:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
it very well follow-up
 
03:09:03.429 --> 03:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
but just as a follow-up what is what was
 
03:09:05.510 --> 03:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
your intention
 
03:09:07.349 --> 03:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
say that again what was your intention
 
03:09:08.550 --> 03:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
once a year
 
03:09:13.750 --> 03:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:13.760 --> 03:09:14.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:09:14.830 --> 03:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:09:14.840 --> 03:09:16.550 align:start position:0%
representative
cahill

03:09:16.550 --> 03:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
cahill
 
03:09:18.309 --> 03:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:09:21.030 --> 03:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
03:09:21.040 --> 03:09:23.510 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:25.349 --> 03:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
is the is the economy
 
03:09:27.910 --> 03:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
the employment rate
 
03:09:30.070 --> 03:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't that sort of it's a standard
 
03:09:32.070 --> 03:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
rate which we say would change it once a
 
03:09:33.830 --> 03:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
year you know if i measure the
 
03:09:35.750 --> 03:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances once a year
 
03:09:35.760 --> 03:09:36.870 align:start position:0%
circumstances once a year
but

03:09:36.870 --> 03:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:09:39.269 --> 03:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
i think the economy sometimes moves more
 
03:09:40.550 --> 03:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
often than that
 
03:09:42.469 --> 03:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
and furthermore i wonder if it's the
 
03:09:44.710 --> 03:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
economy is the same for every sector of
 
03:09:45.990 --> 03:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
the workforce
 
03:09:48.550 --> 03:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
there may be there may be people
 
03:09:50.229 --> 03:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
in one field for which
 
03:09:52.630 --> 03:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
employment is very hard to come by or in
 
03:09:55.269 --> 03:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
another region of the state where jobs
 
03:09:57.830 --> 03:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
are kind of scarce or more plentiful how
 
03:09:59.670 --> 03:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
would you what would you say to that
 
03:10:01.590 --> 03:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
i'd say we need one standard rate we
 
03:10:02.710 --> 03:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
can't be
 
03:10:04.469 --> 03:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
putting together hundreds and hundreds
 
03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
of rates
 
03:10:10.229 --> 03:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:11.590 --> 03:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:10:13.429 --> 03:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
yesterday i sent out some material
 
03:10:16.710 --> 03:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
concerning the trust fund in our state
 
03:10:18.870 --> 03:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
and i wonder if you might tell me how
 
03:10:20.630 --> 03:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire compares with all the
 
03:10:22.389 --> 03:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
states that you listed that some of them
 
03:10:24.790 --> 03:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
are have enacted this and where we fall
 
03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
in that and further there were some
 
03:10:29.190 --> 03:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
issues that uh that affected our trust
 
03:10:30.790 --> 03:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
fund such as
 
03:10:32.550 --> 03:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
the uh the governor opening up
 
03:10:34.070 --> 03:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment to people who were
 
03:10:34.080 --> 03:10:35.510 align:start position:0%
unemployment to people who were
self-employed

03:10:35.510 --> 03:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
self-employed
 
03:10:38.150 --> 03:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
a major major decision that did affect
 
03:10:41.750 --> 03:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
our trust fund uh well it's a good idea
 
03:10:44.309 --> 03:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
saves the economy i just wonder like if
 
03:10:46.229 --> 03:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
things like that that hurt the trust
 
03:10:46.239 --> 03:10:47.590 align:start position:0%
things like that that hurt the trust
fund

03:10:47.590 --> 03:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:10:49.830 --> 03:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
would you prohibit that in some way
 
03:10:51.670 --> 03:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
03:10:53.510 --> 03:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
i will let commissioner deputy
 
03:10:55.750 --> 03:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner laver speak to the quan you
 
03:10:57.670 --> 03:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
know the state of our trust fund right
 
03:10:59.190 --> 03:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
now i i'm
 
03:11:01.750 --> 03:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
i am not an expert on that so i'm not
 
03:11:03.990 --> 03:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
gonna i have no answer for you on that
 
03:11:12.550 --> 03:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:13.990 --> 03:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:11:15.830 --> 03:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:11:17.510 --> 03:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
could you explain your rationale if i
 
03:11:20.070 --> 03:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly the maximum
 
03:11:21.750 --> 03:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
number of weeks
 
03:11:24.950 --> 03:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
would go from 26 to 20. is that
 
03:11:27.590 --> 03:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
what is the rationale for doing that
 
03:11:29.190 --> 03:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
say the last part i'm having a hard time
 
03:11:31.910 --> 03:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
hearing you with the mask right
 
03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding is
 
03:11:35.670 --> 03:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
this bill takes the maximum number of
 
03:11:39.590 --> 03:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
weeks of unemployment from 26 to 20.
 
03:11:41.510 --> 03:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
what is the rationale for that
 
03:11:44.790 --> 03:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
just uh off of other model states model
 
03:11:51.990 --> 03:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:54.150 --> 03:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh representative
 
03:11:55.830 --> 03:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
for context i'm looking at an article
 
03:11:57.750 --> 03:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
right now that said that from business
 
03:12:00.469 --> 03:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
insider that said that is titled
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
president biden gambled that cutting off
 
03:12:04.309 --> 03:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
federal jobless aid would drive people
 
03:12:06.790 --> 03:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
back to work the september jobs report
 
03:12:09.110 --> 03:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
blew a hole through that idea
 
03:12:10.870 --> 03:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
can you tell me the workforce
 
03:12:13.269 --> 03:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
participation rate from
 
03:12:14.950 --> 03:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
governor sununu saying that we were no
 
03:12:17.590 --> 03:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
longer going to participate in the 300
 
03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
a week benefit program
 
03:12:21.429 --> 03:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
and the following workforce
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
participation rate and did people go
 
03:12:25.670 --> 03:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
back to work or did these jobs get
 
03:12:28.229 --> 03:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
filled after that change without looking
 
03:12:30.150 --> 03:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
at that article and looking over all the
 
03:12:31.590 --> 03:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
numbers i can't tell you off the top my
 
03:12:35.349 --> 03:12:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:37.670 --> 03:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
i have one question if i might
 
03:12:40.710 --> 03:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
i want to keep things apples to apples
 
03:12:42.630 --> 03:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire normally has a lower
 
03:12:44.710 --> 03:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
utilization of workers compensation
 
03:12:48.070 --> 03:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
weeks because we have the lowest
 
03:12:48.080 --> 03:12:49.670 align:start position:0%
weeks because we have the lowest
reimbursement

03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
03:12:51.590 --> 03:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
at sixty percent
 
03:12:51.600 --> 03:12:52.630 align:start position:0%
at sixty percent
um

03:12:52.630 --> 03:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:54.229 --> 03:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
or versus
 
03:12:55.830 --> 03:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh that's what was working
 
03:12:57.670 --> 03:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah actually not i was taking
 
03:13:00.150 --> 03:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
workers comp for a second sorry we pay
 
03:13:01.830 --> 03:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
very low
 
03:13:01.840 --> 03:13:02.710 align:start position:0%
very low
um

03:13:02.710 --> 03:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:03.910 --> 03:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
is there any compe
 
03:13:05.750 --> 03:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
you sent us some good stuff on
 
03:13:05.760 --> 03:13:07.110 align:start position:0%
you sent us some good stuff on
florida

03:13:07.110 --> 03:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
florida
 
03:13:09.269 --> 03:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
are we comparable to them
 
03:13:10.790 --> 03:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of what they pay and
 
03:13:10.800 --> 03:13:12.070 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of what they pay and
compensate

03:13:12.070 --> 03:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
compensate
 
03:13:14.229 --> 03:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
compensation because i'm trying i'm just

03:14:09.349 --> 03:14:09.359 align:start position:0%
the committee this new layout makes that
 
03:14:11.110 --> 03:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
very difficult
 
03:14:11.120 --> 03:14:12.309 align:start position:0%
very difficult
so

03:14:12.309 --> 03:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:14:13.830 --> 03:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
what i can do is i'll get two piles
 
03:14:16.469 --> 03:14:16.479 align:start position:0%
going around so folks can have that to
 
03:14:17.910 --> 03:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
refer to
 
03:14:19.510 --> 03:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
one of them is
 
03:14:23.110 --> 03:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
just a one pager on our response from
 
03:14:25.030 --> 03:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
the u.s department of labor when we
 
03:14:26.790 --> 03:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
submitted the bill for their review for
 
03:14:50.389 --> 03:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:52.229 --> 03:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
and i did have one other handout that
 
03:14:53.670 --> 03:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
was much prettier
 
03:14:55.830 --> 03:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh with pictures uh
 
03:14:57.510 --> 03:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
not necessarily for what i'm going to
 
03:14:58.950 --> 03:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
talk about today but just more of a
 
03:15:00.790 --> 03:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
reference point for the members to look
 
03:15:03.670 --> 03:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
at um and it's some materials that uh
 
03:15:05.110 --> 03:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
chairman infantine that we had talked
 
03:15:06.469 --> 03:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
about at the last advisory council
 
03:15:07.830 --> 03:15:07.840 align:start position:0%

members had that
 
03:15:11.269 --> 03:15:11.279 align:start position:0%

have emailed a portion of it and some of
 
03:15:41.190 --> 03:15:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:42.630 --> 03:15:42.640 align:start position:0%

03:15:59.349 --> 03:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
and just to
 
03:16:01.670 --> 03:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
before getting into my comments the
 
03:16:01.680 --> 03:16:05.190 align:start position:0%
before getting into my comments the
department

03:16:05.190 --> 03:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:08.790 --> 03:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
understands appreciates and
 
03:16:11.190 --> 03:16:11.200 align:start position:0%
is a uh
 
03:16:13.269 --> 03:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
really understands that long-term
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
unemployment is not good for anybody
 
03:16:17.349 --> 03:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's not good for the individual it's
 
03:16:20.070 --> 03:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
not good for the economy
 
03:16:21.830 --> 03:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
the first
 
03:16:23.990 --> 03:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
10 years or so
 
03:16:26.469 --> 03:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
of my time with the department i
 
03:16:28.389 --> 03:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
focused my time on reminding people that
 
03:16:31.830 --> 03:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
we were not just the unemployment agency
 
03:16:33.590 --> 03:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
reminding folks about our re-employment
 
03:16:33.600 --> 03:16:34.710 align:start position:0%
reminding folks about our re-employment
services

03:16:34.710 --> 03:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:16:36.150 --> 03:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
and all of the work that we do around
 
03:16:37.990 --> 03:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
training and working one-on-one with
 
03:16:40.950 --> 03:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
individuals to try to get them back into
 
03:16:43.510 --> 03:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
in-demand employment and then i spent
 
03:16:45.190 --> 03:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
two years only dealing with the
 
03:16:46.630 --> 03:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
unemployment program and probably
 
03:16:50.309 --> 03:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
defeating all of that prior work so um
 
03:16:50.319 --> 03:16:51.190 align:start position:0%
defeating all of that prior work so um
we

03:16:51.190 --> 03:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:16:52.870 --> 03:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that long-term
 
03:16:55.269 --> 03:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
unemployment is not good for any of the
 
03:16:58.550 --> 03:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
individuals that we work with
 
03:16:58.560 --> 03:16:59.269 align:start position:0%
individuals that we work with
but

03:16:59.269 --> 03:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:17:01.429 --> 03:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
right-sizing the unemployment program is
 
03:17:03.269 --> 03:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
important and by right-sizing the
 
03:17:05.190 --> 03:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
unemployment program
 
03:17:06.950 --> 03:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
03:17:09.750 --> 03:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
making sure that there are sufficient
 
03:17:11.590 --> 03:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
benefits available
 
03:17:14.150 --> 03:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
for individuals seeking in demand
 
03:17:17.030 --> 03:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
employment which might require
 
03:17:20.469 --> 03:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
new training in entering a new sector
 
03:17:22.870 --> 03:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
i think employers in this state and
 
03:17:22.880 --> 03:17:24.229 align:start position:0%
i think employers in this state and
individuals

03:17:24.229 --> 03:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
03:17:26.309 --> 03:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
certainly have an interest in making
 
03:17:28.870 --> 03:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
sure that individuals are able to
 
03:17:31.990 --> 03:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
afford to be able to obtain that type of
 
03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:33.670 align:start position:0%
afford to be able to obtain that type of
training

03:17:33.670 --> 03:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
for in-demand employment if for no other
 
03:17:36.479 --> 03:17:37.510 align:start position:0%
for in-demand employment if for no other
reason

03:17:37.510 --> 03:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
reason
 
03:17:39.750 --> 03:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
that they are not coming back to the
 
03:17:42.950 --> 03:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
agency on a frequent basis looking for
 
03:17:45.349 --> 03:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits again because they
 
03:17:48.790 --> 03:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
went into a sector that had a
 
03:17:51.269 --> 03:17:51.279 align:start position:0%
lower prospects for job growth and those
 
03:17:53.349 --> 03:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
jobs disappeared so we want to make sure
 
03:17:56.950 --> 03:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
that it's right sized so we're able to
 
03:17:59.110 --> 03:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
lower the number of times an individual
 
03:18:00.950 --> 03:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
has to come over and visit us and file
 
03:18:04.950 --> 03:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
an application for unemployment benefits
 
03:18:04.960 --> 03:18:05.670 align:start position:0%
an application for unemployment benefits
so

03:18:05.670 --> 03:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:18:07.990 --> 03:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
that all being said
 
03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:08.790 align:start position:0%
that all being said
as

03:18:08.790 --> 03:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:18:11.670 --> 03:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
is customary with policy matters coming
 
03:18:13.590 --> 03:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
before the committee the department does
 
03:18:16.630 --> 03:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
not take a position for or against this
 
03:18:16.640 --> 03:18:17.510 align:start position:0%
not take a position for or against this
bill

03:18:17.510 --> 03:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:18:19.429 --> 03:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
but we did want to talk about some of
 
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
the mechanics of it
 
03:18:22.710 --> 03:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
when representative turcotte had
 
03:18:22.720 --> 03:18:24.229 align:start position:0%
when representative turcotte had
indicated

03:18:24.229 --> 03:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
03:18:25.830 --> 03:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
that we've had some discussions about
 
03:18:27.910 --> 03:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
the mechanics and then also wanted to
 
03:18:30.309 --> 03:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
talk about some related issues as well
 
03:18:32.469 --> 03:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
i'll be referring to some notes
 
03:18:34.710 --> 03:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
just so i don't screw up with some
 
03:18:37.110 --> 03:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
numbers here but certainly available to
 
03:18:38.550 --> 03:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
answer questions
 
03:18:40.469 --> 03:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
from members as well
 
03:18:42.229 --> 03:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
so mechanically
 
03:18:44.229 --> 03:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
as i understand the intent behind the
 
03:18:44.239 --> 03:18:45.110 align:start position:0%
as i understand the intent behind the
bill

03:18:45.110 --> 03:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:18:46.870 --> 03:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
what it's seeking to do
 
03:18:50.389 --> 03:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
is to base the number of weeks of
 
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
unemployment that are available to tie
 
03:18:54.870 --> 03:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
that or to index that
 
03:18:57.830 --> 03:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
to the average unemployment rate the
 
03:19:00.150 --> 03:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
total unemployment rate
 
03:19:04.070 --> 03:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
over the third calendar quarter of the
 
03:19:05.830 --> 03:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
prior year
 
03:19:05.840 --> 03:19:06.870 align:start position:0%
prior year
so

03:19:06.870 --> 03:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:09.110 --> 03:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
when we think about the monthly
 
03:19:12.229 --> 03:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate that is not a number
 
03:19:13.990 --> 03:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire employment security
 
03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:15.349 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire employment security
publishes

03:19:15.349 --> 03:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
publishes
 
03:19:17.429 --> 03:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
or is responsible for we have a
 
03:19:19.030 --> 03:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
cooperative agreement
 
03:19:20.870 --> 03:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
with u.s department of labor and the
 
03:19:23.030 --> 03:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
bureau of labor statistics
 
03:19:24.309 --> 03:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
where that is
 
03:19:26.710 --> 03:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
issued out to the state by
 
03:19:29.590 --> 03:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
employment security but the
 
03:19:32.630 --> 03:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
monthly unemployment rate itself that is
 
03:19:34.309 --> 03:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
calculated by the bureau of labor
 
03:19:36.870 --> 03:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
statistics they do that
 
03:19:39.830 --> 03:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
utilizing the federal household survey
 
03:19:42.070 --> 03:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
they survey a sample
 
03:19:44.550 --> 03:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
of households in new hampshire between
 
03:19:47.190 --> 03:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
12 to 1 300
 
03:19:49.110 --> 03:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
households that is a point in time
 
03:19:50.950 --> 03:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
survey they do it during the week of the
 
03:19:53.750 --> 03:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
month that contains the 12th
 
03:19:57.429 --> 03:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
and from that survey they then
 
03:19:59.990 --> 03:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
calculate their estimates for the number
 
03:20:03.190 --> 03:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
of individuals in the labor force
 
03:20:05.110 --> 03:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
either you're employed or you're
 
03:20:07.429 --> 03:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
unemployed in order to count as
 
03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
unemployed you need to a not be working
 
03:20:13.030 --> 03:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
and be actively searching for work and
 
03:20:15.349 --> 03:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
have actively searched for work in the
 
03:20:17.990 --> 03:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
prior four weeks so that survey is
 
03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:19.349 align:start position:0%
prior four weeks so that survey is
conducted

03:20:19.349 --> 03:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
conducted
 
03:20:21.030 --> 03:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
by the federal government it is their
 
03:20:22.950 --> 03:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
survey it's not something that
 
03:20:25.190 --> 03:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
employment security is out there
 
03:20:27.750 --> 03:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
calculating on a monthly basis so i just
 
03:20:29.830 --> 03:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that mechanically we
 
03:20:33.750 --> 03:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
understand how that rate is calculated
 
03:20:33.760 --> 03:20:35.510 align:start position:0%
understand how that rate is calculated
so

03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:20:37.190 --> 03:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
according to this bill
 
03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
we would take the average
 
03:20:40.870 --> 03:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:20:43.269 --> 03:20:43.279 align:start position:0%
total or what we would recommend using
 
03:20:45.910 --> 03:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
the total unemployment rate which is
 
03:20:47.429 --> 03:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
that number that people are most
 
03:20:49.190 --> 03:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
familiar with that is published each
 
03:20:49.200 --> 03:20:50.630 align:start position:0%
familiar with that is published each
month

03:20:50.630 --> 03:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
month
 
03:20:52.469 --> 03:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
you'd average that from the prior third
 
03:20:52.479 --> 03:20:53.429 align:start position:0%
you'd average that from the prior third
quarter

03:20:53.429 --> 03:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
03:20:55.590 --> 03:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
and that would be the number that would
 
03:20:57.990 --> 03:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
be controlling for the following four
 
03:20:58.000 --> 03:20:59.990 align:start position:0%
be controlling for the following four
quarters

03:20:59.990 --> 03:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
quarters
 
03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:00.790 align:start position:0%
quarters
if

03:21:00.790 --> 03:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:21:04.950 --> 03:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
that rate were at or below 5
 
03:21:06.790 --> 03:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
the number of weeks available would be
 
03:21:06.800 --> 03:21:07.830 align:start position:0%
the number of weeks available would be
12

03:21:07.830 --> 03:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
12
 
03:21:10.389 --> 03:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
and then for every half point
 
03:21:13.830 --> 03:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
above five percent uh the bill would add
 
03:21:16.550 --> 03:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
an additional week up to a maximum
 
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
of 20 weeks
 
03:21:20.469 --> 03:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
there are uh
 
03:21:22.150 --> 03:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte and i had have
 
03:21:25.510 --> 03:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
discussed this there are a couple of
 
03:21:27.429 --> 03:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
opportunities when the rate that is
 
03:21:29.110 --> 03:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
first published
 
03:21:31.510 --> 03:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
that it subsequently is revised
 
03:21:31.520 --> 03:21:32.870 align:start position:0%
that it subsequently is revised
and

03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:35.030 --> 03:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
because of that revision process we had
 
03:21:37.269 --> 03:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
made a recommendation on making sure to
 
03:21:39.590 --> 03:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
use the benchmarked rate
 
03:21:42.550 --> 03:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
and by that i mean when a rate is first
 
03:21:44.710 --> 03:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
published so
 
03:21:44.720 --> 03:21:47.030 align:start position:0%
published so
tomorrow

03:21:47.030 --> 03:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
03:21:48.710 --> 03:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
the u.s department of labor will be
 
03:21:50.309 --> 03:21:50.319 align:start position:0%
publishing the national unemployment
 
03:21:53.750 --> 03:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
rate for january later on this month in
 
03:21:55.670 --> 03:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
a few weeks we will publish the
 
03:21:57.750 --> 03:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment the january unemployment
 
03:21:57.760 --> 03:21:59.110 align:start position:0%
unemployment the january unemployment
rate

03:21:59.110 --> 03:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
rate
 
03:22:00.790 --> 03:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire
 
03:22:03.750 --> 03:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
now when we publish the january rate
 
03:22:05.269 --> 03:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
we will also
 
03:22:08.950 --> 03:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
update and revise the prior months rate
 
03:22:11.190 --> 03:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
so you'll see us in the
 
03:22:12.790 --> 03:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
press release that goes out you'll see
 
03:22:15.190 --> 03:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
the january rate and we will also
 
03:22:17.429 --> 03:22:17.439 align:start position:0%
there'll be a quick reference saying and
 
03:22:21.429 --> 03:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
the the december rate stayed at 2.6
 
03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
after revised or the december rate was
 
03:22:26.550 --> 03:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
adjusted to 2.8
 
03:22:29.750 --> 03:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
after revision so you have that
 
03:22:32.229 --> 03:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
first opportunity where you
 
03:22:36.309 --> 03:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh the the rate that was first published
 
03:22:37.910 --> 03:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
is subject to a revision in that
 
03:22:39.670 --> 03:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
following month
 
03:22:42.070 --> 03:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
and then at the end of the year
 
03:22:44.870 --> 03:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
we go through a benchmarking process um
 
03:22:47.269 --> 03:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
that is concluded in february of each
 
03:22:49.030 --> 03:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
year so that's something that's ongoing
 
03:22:51.830 --> 03:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
right now and drawing to its conclusion
 
03:22:55.030 --> 03:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
but benchmarking is a process by which
 
03:22:56.550 --> 03:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
we take the
 
03:22:59.830 --> 03:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
survey-based estimates which were
 
03:23:01.269 --> 03:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
published each month for the
 
03:23:03.670 --> 03:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate during the year and we
 
03:23:07.030 --> 03:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
compare those against the actual
 
03:23:08.870 --> 03:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
quarterly tax and wage reports that
 
03:23:11.830 --> 03:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
employers file when they come to
 
03:23:13.830 --> 03:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
employment security every month and they
 
03:23:15.990 --> 03:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
tell us how many people they employed
 
03:23:18.630 --> 03:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
and how much they paid them so that is
 
03:23:21.269 --> 03:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
compared against those estimates
 
03:23:25.110 --> 03:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
and then each february we then publish
 
03:23:28.150 --> 03:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
the prior year's rates as benchmarked
 
03:23:28.160 --> 03:23:29.110 align:start position:0%
the prior year's rates as benchmarked
rates

03:23:29.110 --> 03:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
rates
 
03:23:31.269 --> 03:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
so those would then be the final rates
 
03:23:33.429 --> 03:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
for that prior year
 
03:23:35.990 --> 03:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i i walk you through that process
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
so that we can better understand when
 
03:23:39.750 --> 03:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
when we
 
03:23:42.630 --> 03:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
talk about using the benchmark rate you
 
03:23:44.790 --> 03:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
would want to use that final rate and
 
03:23:46.469 --> 03:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
not something that was subject to
 
03:23:48.950 --> 03:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
movement and because of that and because
 
03:23:52.070 --> 03:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
the process is not completed until
 
03:23:55.190 --> 03:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
february of each subsequent year
 
03:23:57.269 --> 03:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
mechanically how i would see this bill
 
03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
working is that once that was complete
 
03:24:01.349 --> 03:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
in february
 
03:24:04.309 --> 03:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
then starting in the second quarter you
 
03:24:07.670 --> 03:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
would be using the prior year's third
 
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
quarter average as benchmarked and then
 
03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
you would use that number for the second
 
03:24:17.429 --> 03:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
third fourth and first quarters and then
 
03:24:19.750 --> 03:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
we would do it all over again
 
03:24:21.590 --> 03:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
using the benchmarked rate for that
 
03:24:23.750 --> 03:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
prior year's third quarter so it would
 
03:24:25.910 --> 03:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
control for four quarters but it
 
03:24:27.670 --> 03:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a nice neat and clean
 
03:24:30.790 --> 03:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
orderly one through four of the calendar
 
03:24:32.469 --> 03:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
year it would be
 
03:24:34.630 --> 03:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
you would be doing it starting in the
 
03:24:36.710 --> 03:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
second calendar quarter two three four
 
03:24:38.710 --> 03:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
and then that first calendar quarter and
 
03:24:40.790 --> 03:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
do that process
 
03:24:48.389 --> 03:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:48.399 --> 03:24:49.349 align:start position:0%
 
in

03:24:49.349 --> 03:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:24:51.670 --> 03:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:24:55.110 --> 03:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
information relative to to this the bill
 
03:24:59.190 --> 03:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:01.110 --> 03:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
our recent
 
03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
first and foremost our unemployment rate
 
03:25:06.870 --> 03:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:08.950 --> 03:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic right before this
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
all starting we were at 2.6
 
03:25:15.349 --> 03:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
and we are now back to 2.6
 
03:25:18.150 --> 03:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
our recent historical high
 
03:25:20.950 --> 03:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh prior to the pandemic uh was back
 
03:25:23.190 --> 03:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
during the great recession uh when we
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
hit 6.7
 
03:25:28.469 --> 03:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
that was in november of 2009
 
03:25:31.990 --> 03:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
through january of 2010. that was at a
 
03:25:33.750 --> 03:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
time period when the national rate was
 
03:25:35.670 --> 03:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
right around 10
 
03:25:39.110 --> 03:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire maxed out at that 6.7
 
03:25:41.190 --> 03:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
percent during that time period
 
03:25:43.670 --> 03:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
and then prior to that uh back in the
 
03:25:45.269 --> 03:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
early 90s
 
03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
1992 specifically we had hit 7.4
 
03:25:50.790 --> 03:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of some of the
 
03:25:53.670 --> 03:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
perspective on where our unemployment
 
03:25:55.670 --> 03:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
rate has been where some of our high
 
03:25:57.830 --> 03:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
points have been
 
03:25:57.840 --> 03:25:58.710 align:start position:0%
points have been
um

03:25:58.710 --> 03:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:00.630 --> 03:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
if the the formula
 
03:26:03.590 --> 03:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's proposed here in the the
 
03:26:05.590 --> 03:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 1337
 
03:26:07.830 --> 03:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
if that were in effect right now
 
03:26:10.150 --> 03:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
we would currently have 15 weeks
 
03:26:10.160 --> 03:26:12.790 align:start position:0%
we would currently have 15 weeks
available

03:26:12.790 --> 03:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:26:12.800 --> 03:26:15.990 align:start position:0%
available
and

03:26:15.990 --> 03:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:17.110 align:start position:0%
 
because

03:26:17.110 --> 03:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:26:18.950 --> 03:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
where even though i just told you we're
 
03:26:20.389 --> 03:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
at 2.6
 
03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
because of going back and using that
 
03:26:24.710 --> 03:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
prior year's third quarter
 
03:26:27.349 --> 03:26:27.359 align:start position:0%
you would have the number of weeks
 
03:26:29.750 --> 03:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
dictated by what that average was for
 
03:26:31.750 --> 03:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
that third quarter and that would that
 
03:26:34.469 --> 03:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
would be our our 15 weeks
 
03:26:34.479 --> 03:26:35.510 align:start position:0%
would be our our 15 weeks
um

03:26:35.510 --> 03:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:37.190 --> 03:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
one um
 
03:26:40.550 --> 03:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
this point of um
 
03:26:42.790 --> 03:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
comment on on the unemployment rate
 
03:26:42.800 --> 03:26:43.990 align:start position:0%
comment on on the unemployment rate
itself

03:26:43.990 --> 03:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
itself
 
03:26:46.150 --> 03:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
the the unemployment rate is what we
 
03:26:50.630 --> 03:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
refer to as a lagging economic indicator
 
03:26:53.590 --> 03:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't tell us where we are right
 
03:26:53.600 --> 03:26:54.950 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't tell us where we are right
now

03:26:54.950 --> 03:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:26:57.269 --> 03:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
it tells us where we were
 
03:26:59.429 --> 03:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
and that prior month
 
03:27:02.070 --> 03:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
in that week containing the 12th of that
 
03:27:06.309 --> 03:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
month when that survey was conducted
 
03:27:10.150 --> 03:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
and that's an important consideration
 
03:27:12.309 --> 03:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
when we get into talking about how some
 
03:27:15.190 --> 03:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
other states that have variable duration
 
03:27:15.200 --> 03:27:17.750 align:start position:0%
other states that have variable duration
unemployment

03:27:17.750 --> 03:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
03:27:17.760 --> 03:27:18.950 align:start position:0%
unemployment
benefits

03:27:18.950 --> 03:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
03:27:20.550 --> 03:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
like proposed here
 
03:27:22.550 --> 03:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
some of the factors that they take into
 
03:27:25.190 --> 03:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
consideration on on
 
03:27:25.200 --> 03:27:26.229 align:start position:0%
consideration on on
how

03:27:26.229 --> 03:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:27:28.389 --> 03:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
the number of weeks available
 
03:27:28.399 --> 03:27:31.750 align:start position:0%
the number of weeks available
change

03:27:31.750 --> 03:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:34.229 --> 03:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
as i had indicated right now
 
03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
with our rate at 2.6 percent
 
03:27:39.510 --> 03:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
we would have 15 weeks available
 
03:27:41.670 --> 03:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
according to this bill
 
03:27:45.190 --> 03:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
however if we went back to
 
03:27:48.950 --> 03:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
the second and third quarter of 2020
 
03:27:51.510 --> 03:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
because we're we'd be indexing and then
 
03:27:52.630 --> 03:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
we'd be
 
03:27:56.950 --> 03:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
tying ourselves to four quarters during
 
03:27:56.960 --> 03:27:58.389 align:start position:0%
tying ourselves to four quarters during
the

03:27:58.389 --> 03:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:00.790 --> 03:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
second and third quarters of 2020 which
 
03:28:05.030 --> 03:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
is a time period i've tried to forget um
 
03:28:07.190 --> 03:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
it was a very difficult time period for
 
03:28:09.590 --> 03:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
us all certainly for the folks at
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
employment security um with the
 
03:28:14.070 --> 03:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate having gone to 16
 
03:28:18.070 --> 03:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
percent um but the but the
 
03:28:19.750 --> 03:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
number of weeks available during that
 
03:28:21.349 --> 03:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
time for state unemployment would have
 
03:28:23.030 --> 03:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
been 12.
 
03:28:25.190 --> 03:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
um so that's some of the
 
03:28:25.200 --> 03:28:26.630 align:start position:0%
um so that's some of the
um

03:28:26.630 --> 03:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:29.190 --> 03:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
issues that you can see when you're
 
03:28:30.950 --> 03:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
utilizing a lagging
 
03:28:33.750 --> 03:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
economic indicator depending on how long
 
03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to use it
 
03:28:35.520 --> 03:28:36.389 align:start position:0%
you're going to use it
um

03:28:36.389 --> 03:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:39.670 --> 03:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
a changing economy um could still be
 
03:28:41.590 --> 03:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
subject to controls that were put in
 
03:28:43.429 --> 03:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
place um
 
03:28:46.550 --> 03:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
prior um to um
 
03:28:49.030 --> 03:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
those in that case some significant
 
03:28:49.040 --> 03:28:50.830 align:start position:0%
those in that case some significant
changes

03:28:50.830 --> 03:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:28:50.840 --> 03:28:52.550 align:start position:0%
changes
um

03:28:52.550 --> 03:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:52.560 --> 03:28:53.830 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:28:53.830 --> 03:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:28:56.229 --> 03:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
and that's a point that's made just so
 
03:28:58.870 --> 03:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
that as you're looking at at this bill
 
03:29:03.429 --> 03:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
and trying to um make sure it
 
03:29:05.910 --> 03:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
fits well into what we need here in new
 
03:29:05.920 --> 03:29:07.429 align:start position:0%
fits well into what we need here in new
hampshire

03:29:07.429 --> 03:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:29:09.830 --> 03:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps there's
 
03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
there's consideration for some
 
03:29:12.239 --> 03:29:14.229 align:start position:0%
there's consideration for some
flexibility

03:29:14.229 --> 03:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
03:29:18.070 --> 03:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:21.349 --> 03:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
indexed rate from that third quarter
 
03:29:24.550 --> 03:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
how long it controls the duration and
 
03:29:26.630 --> 03:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's a
 
03:29:28.309 --> 03:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
some sort of
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
statutory shutoff switch
 
03:29:33.670 --> 03:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
that can be temporarily implemented to
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
try to right-size the duration of
 
03:29:39.670 --> 03:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
benefits for what you're experiencing at
 
03:29:43.750 --> 03:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:43.760 --> 03:29:44.469 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:29:44.469 --> 03:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:29:48.229 --> 03:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
looking at our current statute uh with
 
03:29:48.239 --> 03:29:49.110 align:start position:0%
looking at our current statute uh with
uh

03:29:49.110 --> 03:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:29:52.389 --> 03:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
20 currently 26 weeks being available
 
03:29:56.550 --> 03:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
this has been the case since 1951
 
03:29:59.590 --> 03:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
so an individual coming in and filing
 
03:30:03.110 --> 03:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
right now if they have a
 
03:30:05.830 --> 03:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
qualifying separation
 
03:30:05.840 --> 03:30:06.630 align:start position:0%
qualifying separation
if

03:30:06.630 --> 03:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:30:09.030 --> 03:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
they have
 
03:30:11.349 --> 03:30:11.359 align:start position:0%
sufficient earnings
 
03:30:13.990 --> 03:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
from their base period
 
03:30:17.190 --> 03:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
they would qualify for up to those 26
 
03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
weeks and those 26 weeks
 
03:30:23.590 --> 03:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
would be claimed over a 52-week period
 
03:30:26.150 --> 03:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
now we do allow in new hampshire we do
 
03:30:29.190 --> 03:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
allow someone to have part-time work
 
03:30:33.269 --> 03:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
while collecting for unemployment
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
and i point that out because
 
03:30:38.150 --> 03:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
individuals who do have part-time work
 
03:30:40.790 --> 03:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
and are collecting partial benefits may
 
03:30:43.590 --> 03:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
collect longer than 26 weeks
 
03:30:43.600 --> 03:30:44.790 align:start position:0%
collect longer than 26 weeks
and

03:30:44.790 --> 03:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:30:46.150 --> 03:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
those individuals have to have a
 
03:30:48.389 --> 03:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
qualifying separation they have to be
 
03:30:48.399 --> 03:30:49.510 align:start position:0%
qualifying separation they have to be
determined

03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
determined
 
03:30:52.150 --> 03:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
to be unemployed or have a reduction in
 
03:30:55.110 --> 03:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
employment through no fault of their own
 
03:30:58.309 --> 03:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
but an individual who's not working they
 
03:31:01.429 --> 03:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
cannot collect more than those 26 weeks
 
03:31:03.670 --> 03:31:03.680 align:start position:0%
during that 52-week period but an
 
03:31:07.590 --> 03:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
individual that has part-time employment
 
03:31:09.670 --> 03:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
they could be having a partial benefit
 
03:31:12.389 --> 03:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
so maybe they qualify for 300
 
03:31:14.070 --> 03:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
a week
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
but their partial earnings bring that
 
03:31:19.190 --> 03:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
benefit down to 200 a week they could be
 
03:31:22.710 --> 03:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
collecting for a longer period of time
 
03:31:25.510 --> 03:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
however i think both of those examples
 
03:31:27.110 --> 03:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
both the person who's not working and
 
03:31:29.190 --> 03:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
the person who's working part-time would
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
both be subject to the durational limit
 
03:31:35.030 --> 03:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
based on the index here so uh the 12
 
03:31:38.309 --> 03:31:38.319 align:start position:0%
weeks or whatever that is as indicated
 
03:31:41.910 --> 03:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
by the prior year's third quarter
 
03:31:41.920 --> 03:31:43.349 align:start position:0%
by the prior year's third quarter
average

03:31:43.349 --> 03:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
average
 
03:31:45.429 --> 03:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
now um an individual that's working
 
03:31:47.510 --> 03:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
part-time you've heard from me before on
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
this the
 
03:31:52.389 --> 03:31:52.399 align:start position:0%
they are only allowed to earn
 
03:31:55.190 --> 03:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
up to 30 of their weekly benefit amount
 
03:31:58.710 --> 03:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
before it starts to um affect uh how
 
03:32:00.229 --> 03:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
much they're able to get from
 
03:32:01.830 --> 03:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment so
 
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
you're able to earn up to 30
 
03:32:05.429 --> 03:32:05.439 align:start position:0%
of your weekly benefit amount and then
 
03:32:07.670 --> 03:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
every dollar above that that you earn is
 
03:32:10.229 --> 03:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
subtracted from your weekly benefit
 
03:32:12.229 --> 03:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
amount dollar for dollar
 
03:32:14.150 --> 03:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
so that's how we
 
03:32:16.550 --> 03:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
currently limit how much someone can
 
03:32:16.560 --> 03:32:17.670 align:start position:0%
currently limit how much someone can
earn

03:32:17.670 --> 03:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
earn
 
03:32:20.070 --> 03:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
while collecting unemployment states do
 
03:32:21.750 --> 03:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
that differently new hampshire has that
 
03:32:24.550 --> 03:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
30 percent rule other surrounding states
 
03:32:25.910 --> 03:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
i know maine has
 
03:32:27.910 --> 03:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
sets it at a fixed dollar amount so
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
you're able to earn a hundred dollars
 
03:32:31.670 --> 03:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
and then anything above that gets
 
03:32:41.030 --> 03:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:42.630 --> 03:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:32:45.190 --> 03:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
just the national picture on number of
 
03:32:47.190 --> 03:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
weeks available and how new hampshire
 
03:32:47.200 --> 03:32:49.190 align:start position:0%
weeks available and how new hampshire
compares

03:32:49.190 --> 03:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
compares
 
03:32:52.870 --> 03:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
there are currently 34 states
 
03:32:56.070 --> 03:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
that provide at least a maximum of 26
 
03:32:56.080 --> 03:32:57.110 align:start position:0%
that provide at least a maximum of 26
weeks

03:32:57.110 --> 03:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
03:32:58.950 --> 03:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
like new hampshire
 
03:33:00.950 --> 03:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
but it's only 10 of those states that
 
03:33:03.190 --> 03:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
have a uniform duration like new
 
03:33:04.389 --> 03:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire so
 
03:33:07.590 --> 03:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
we you come in you qualify
 
03:33:07.600 --> 03:33:08.630 align:start position:0%
we you come in you qualify
you're

03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
you're
 
03:33:11.590 --> 03:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
you qualify for a weekly benefit amount
 
03:33:13.510 --> 03:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
as determined by the table that's in our
 
03:33:16.070 --> 03:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
statute and then you're able to collect
 
03:33:17.190 --> 03:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
that amount
 
03:33:20.150 --> 03:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
multiplied by 26 so up to 26 weeks of
 
03:33:20.160 --> 03:33:21.349 align:start position:0%
multiplied by 26 so up to 26 weeks of
benefits

03:33:21.349 --> 03:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
03:33:24.950 --> 03:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
and 10 states have that as a a uniform
 
03:33:24.960 --> 03:33:26.710 align:start position:0%
and 10 states have that as a a uniform
duration

03:33:26.710 --> 03:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
duration
 
03:33:29.590 --> 03:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
the other states have variable variable
 
03:33:29.600 --> 03:33:30.950 align:start position:0%
the other states have variable variable
duration

03:33:30.950 --> 03:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
duration
 
03:33:34.870 --> 03:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
ranges and they're dependent upon
 
03:33:36.630 --> 03:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
a host of factors
 
03:33:39.510 --> 03:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
including how much someone earned in
 
03:33:41.910 --> 03:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
wages during their base period base
 
03:33:44.870 --> 03:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
period base period being the four
 
03:33:47.750 --> 03:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
quarters prior to your separation and
 
03:33:49.910 --> 03:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
filing for unemployment from which we
 
03:33:51.990 --> 03:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
calculate your weekly benefit amount
 
03:33:52.000 --> 03:33:53.670 align:start position:0%
calculate your weekly benefit amount
from

03:33:53.670 --> 03:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:33:59.030 --> 03:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:00.870 --> 03:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
there are 37
 
03:34:00.880 --> 03:34:02.630 align:start position:0%
there are 37
states

03:34:02.630 --> 03:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:34:04.790 --> 03:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
that actually
 
03:34:06.870 --> 03:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
have a variable
 
03:34:09.510 --> 03:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
duration and that 37 is more than what i
 
03:34:12.070 --> 03:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
just said before is 34 because
 
03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
the 34 represented how many had a max
 
03:34:18.150 --> 03:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
duration of 26. there are other max
 
03:34:18.160 --> 03:34:19.429 align:start position:0%
duration of 26. there are other max
durations

03:34:19.429 --> 03:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
durations
 
03:34:21.510 --> 03:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
for a number of weeks you can collect
 
03:34:24.550 --> 03:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
but there are 37 states that have a
 
03:34:27.670 --> 03:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
a duration that is variable
 
03:34:30.070 --> 03:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
dependent upon those factors
 
03:34:31.990 --> 03:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
the the most
 
03:34:32.000 --> 03:34:33.110 align:start position:0%
the the most
common

03:34:33.110 --> 03:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
common
 
03:34:35.269 --> 03:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
variable that they use again is the
 
03:34:37.110 --> 03:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
amount that you earned
 
03:34:39.429 --> 03:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
during your base period during that four
 
03:34:41.670 --> 03:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
quarter period
 
03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
how it is commonly used
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of looking at your base period
 
03:34:48.790 --> 03:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
earnings to determine how many weeks of
 
03:34:52.150 --> 03:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
unemployment you get it is commonly used
 
03:34:52.160 --> 03:34:53.110 align:start position:0%
unemployment you get it is commonly used
to

03:34:53.110 --> 03:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:34:56.070 --> 03:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
control duration so that if your
 
03:34:57.990 --> 03:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
earnings were over
 
03:35:00.070 --> 03:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
say all four quarters of your base
 
03:35:02.550 --> 03:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
period you were going to qualify for a
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
longer duration of benefits
 
03:35:07.990 --> 03:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
if your earnings were concentrated say
 
03:35:10.710 --> 03:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
within a single quarter of your base
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
period now your duration of benefits is
 
03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
going to be shorter so that's
 
03:35:20.309 --> 03:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
commonly how they utilize base period
 
03:35:23.670 --> 03:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
earnings to determine your duration of
 
03:35:23.680 --> 03:35:25.349 align:start position:0%
earnings to determine your duration of
unemployment

03:35:25.349 --> 03:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
03:35:26.309 --> 03:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:35:27.990 --> 03:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
four states
 
03:35:30.550 --> 03:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
that have a variable duration that's
 
03:35:33.830 --> 03:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
based on a blend of factors
 
03:35:37.590 --> 03:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
that includes base period earnings and
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate
 
03:35:41.030 --> 03:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
like proposed here
 
03:35:43.830 --> 03:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
this would be tied to exclusively to the
 
03:35:46.790 --> 03:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate uh florida being one
 
03:35:48.550 --> 03:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
of them georgia idaho
 
03:35:50.710 --> 03:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
and kansas all have
 
03:35:52.389 --> 03:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
variable duration
 
03:35:55.030 --> 03:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
that is tied to both
 
03:35:57.349 --> 03:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
the unemployment rate and
 
03:35:59.510 --> 03:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
the amount that you earned in your base
 
03:35:59.520 --> 03:36:05.110 align:start position:0%
the amount that you earned in your base
period

03:36:05.110 --> 03:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:06.469 --> 03:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
it's important to
 
03:36:09.510 --> 03:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
to remember as uh chairman infantine had
 
03:36:11.910 --> 03:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
03:36:14.070 --> 03:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
the amount that an individual is
 
03:36:15.670 --> 03:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
eligible for in terms of their weekly
 
03:36:17.349 --> 03:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
benefit amount
 
03:36:18.870 --> 03:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire compared to our
 
03:36:20.550 --> 03:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
surrounding states and the in the
 
03:36:22.550 --> 03:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
country as a whole
 
03:36:24.790 --> 03:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
tends to be low
 
03:36:26.389 --> 03:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:36:29.030 --> 03:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
coming in qualifying for unemployment
 
03:36:32.870 --> 03:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
the maximum weekly benefit amount that
 
03:36:35.990 --> 03:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
they could be eligible for is 427
 
03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:37.429 align:start position:0%
they could be eligible for is 427
dollars

03:36:37.429 --> 03:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:36:39.349 --> 03:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
that has been the case
 
03:36:41.910 --> 03:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
since 2007
 
03:36:44.070 --> 03:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
when the legislature had added some
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
additional tiers of benefits to the
 
03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
statutory table so someone earning needs
 
03:36:52.550 --> 03:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
to earn forty one thousand five hundred
 
03:36:55.190 --> 03:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
dollars in their base period in order to
 
03:36:57.190 --> 03:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
qualify for that four hundred and twenty
 
03:36:59.110 --> 03:36:59.120 align:start position:0%
seven dollars a week
 
03:37:02.150 --> 03:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
um that is so if you're earning 41.5
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
that's about a 54 wage replacement rate
 
03:37:09.429 --> 03:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
if you are earning at our current uh
 
03:37:11.110 --> 03:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
private sector
 
03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
um average
 
03:37:17.110 --> 03:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
weekly wage that's about a 31 percent
 
03:37:19.349 --> 03:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
wage replacement rate for those
 
03:37:19.359 --> 03:37:21.030 align:start position:0%
wage replacement rate for those
individuals

03:37:21.030 --> 03:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
03:37:21.040 --> 03:37:21.750 align:start position:0%
individuals
and

03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:24.790 --> 03:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
i point that out just
 
03:37:27.670 --> 03:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
as a lead into talking about duration
 
03:37:29.990 --> 03:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire that has tended to
 
03:37:31.910 --> 03:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
be the biggest control
 
03:37:34.229 --> 03:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
on duration of unemployment
 
03:37:37.269 --> 03:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire has been the amount of
 
03:37:41.349 --> 03:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
our weekly benefit amount and the
 
03:37:43.910 --> 03:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
less of a wage replacement rate or a
 
03:37:45.750 --> 03:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
lower percentage
 
03:37:48.309 --> 03:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
that it it is currently
 
03:37:49.990 --> 03:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:37:52.950 --> 03:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
wage replacement rate being about 31
 
03:37:56.830 --> 03:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
of the average private sector uh wage
 
03:37:59.750 --> 03:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
so uh prior to the pandemic we had an
 
03:38:03.030 --> 03:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
average duration of 12 weeks so 26 weeks
 
03:38:03.040 --> 03:38:04.070 align:start position:0%
average duration of 12 weeks so 26 weeks
available

03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:38:04.080 --> 03:38:04.870 align:start position:0%
available
uh

03:38:04.870 --> 03:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:38:07.510 --> 03:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
12 weeks was your average duration and
 
03:38:12.710 --> 03:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
we had about 16 so 1 6 16 of people that
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
exhausted their benefits are used all 26
 
03:38:15.840 --> 03:38:17.830 align:start position:0%
exhausted their benefits are used all 26
weeks

03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
03:38:20.790 --> 03:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
we have a current average duration of
 
03:38:23.950 --> 03:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
just under 17 weeks
 
03:38:27.110 --> 03:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
16.8 weeks right now on them on the most
 
03:38:28.710 --> 03:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
recent numbers
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
with an exhaustion rate
 
03:38:33.189 --> 03:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
of 13
 
03:38:36.389 --> 03:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
nationally the exhaustion rate uh was
 
03:38:38.950 --> 03:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
currently over 29 percent
 
03:38:41.510 --> 03:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
and our surrounding states
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
have exhaustion rates that are higher
 
03:38:46.630 --> 03:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
than new hampshire is currently
 
03:38:48.389 --> 03:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
we currently have the seventh lowest
 
03:38:50.550 --> 03:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
exhaustion rate um in the country so
 
03:38:53.030 --> 03:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
exhaustion again being how many people
 
03:38:55.590 --> 03:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
that qualify on an initial claim how
 
03:38:57.750 --> 03:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
many of them use all of the weeks that
 
03:39:00.790 --> 03:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
are available to them
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
looking at overall tax burden um as you
 
03:39:06.870 --> 03:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
know we spoke and talked last week
 
03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
extensively about this but our
 
03:39:11.110 --> 03:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment program is uh supported
 
03:39:14.070 --> 03:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
entirely by new hampshire business
 
03:39:15.910 --> 03:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
i see some nodding heads in here
 
03:39:17.670 --> 03:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
particularly representative avalani he
 
03:39:19.830 --> 03:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
knows it very well
 
03:39:24.229 --> 03:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:26.469 --> 03:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic
 
03:39:28.229 --> 03:39:28.239 align:start position:0%
looking at overall
 
03:39:30.070 --> 03:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
ui tax burden
 
03:39:31.990 --> 03:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire had the second
 
03:39:35.110 --> 03:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
lowest ui tax burden in the country and
 
03:39:36.670 --> 03:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
that was at
 
03:39:40.710 --> 03:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
0.14 percent of total wages paid
 
03:39:41.790 --> 03:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
03:39:45.269 --> 03:39:45.279 align:start position:0%
0.56 percent of taxable wages because
 
03:39:47.830 --> 03:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
remember an employer pays on the first
 
03:39:51.189 --> 03:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
14 000 of annual wages to each employee
 
03:39:54.790 --> 03:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
not total wages to each employee
 
03:39:59.110 --> 03:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh to compare to uh florida uh prior to
 
03:40:02.070 --> 03:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
the pandemic uh florida had the lowest
 
03:40:05.670 --> 03:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
um ui tax burden for total compared to
 
03:40:05.680 --> 03:40:06.790 align:start position:0%
um ui tax burden for total compared to
total

03:40:06.790 --> 03:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
total
 
03:40:09.670 --> 03:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
wages paid at 0.12
 
03:40:14.229 --> 03:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:14.239 --> 03:40:15.990 align:start position:0%
 
but

03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:40:18.550 --> 03:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:40:21.750 --> 03:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
comparison of ui tax burden
 
03:40:24.309 --> 03:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
when we looked just at taxable wages new
 
03:40:27.030 --> 03:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire was at .56
 
03:40:29.830 --> 03:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
florida was at .66
 
03:40:31.590 --> 03:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
so very close
 
03:40:33.670 --> 03:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
to each other
 
03:40:35.750 --> 03:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
i guess the
 
03:40:37.429 --> 03:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
what to remember there is that new
 
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire has
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
historically had a very low
 
03:40:43.189 --> 03:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
ui tax burden
 
03:40:47.269 --> 03:40:47.279 align:start position:0%
and one of the lowest in the country
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
that tax burden has increased
 
03:40:54.309 --> 03:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
as a result of the pandemic
 
03:40:56.710 --> 03:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
and you have there's some
 
03:40:59.510 --> 03:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
information in the materials that i had
 
03:41:01.429 --> 03:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
provided showing how many people have
 
03:41:03.110 --> 03:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
collected over the last
 
03:41:05.189 --> 03:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
two years
 
03:41:06.950 --> 03:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
roughly we
 
03:41:09.750 --> 03:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
about one quarter
 
03:41:11.590 --> 03:41:11.600 align:start position:0%
23 percent
 
03:41:13.110 --> 03:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire's total labor force
 
03:41:15.189 --> 03:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
relied upon the unemployment program
 
03:41:17.510 --> 03:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
during 20 and 21.
 
03:41:20.870 --> 03:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's about 10 percent more so about 13
 
03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
relied upon the unemployment program and
 
03:41:23.830 --> 03:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
the great recession
 
03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
and we had about 25 relied upon it
 
03:41:29.429 --> 03:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
during our pandemic period
 
03:41:31.590 --> 03:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
so we have seen an increase in that
 
03:41:34.389 --> 03:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
overall ui tax burden
 
03:41:34.399 --> 03:41:35.990 align:start position:0%
overall ui tax burden
but

03:41:35.990 --> 03:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:41:37.750 --> 03:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
what you'll see in those materials is
 
03:41:41.670 --> 03:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
that the average tax rates are falling
 
03:41:43.910 --> 03:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
incredibly fast
 
03:41:46.229 --> 03:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
and there's it's not a
 
03:41:50.070 --> 03:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
coincidence it's it's very intentional
 
03:41:51.510 --> 03:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
but they're falling at a higher rate
 
03:41:53.429 --> 03:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
despite having paid
 
03:41:55.110 --> 03:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
more people in the prior two years than
 
03:41:57.429 --> 03:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
we did in the prior 15.
 
03:41:59.189 --> 03:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
you know more dollars went out in two
 
03:42:00.950 --> 03:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
years than we then had went out in the
 
03:42:03.590 --> 03:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
prior 15 supported a quarter of the new
 
03:42:05.750 --> 03:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire labor force
 
03:42:08.229 --> 03:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
but when you look at
 
03:42:10.469 --> 03:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
average tax rates
 
03:42:12.790 --> 03:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
during the height of the pandemic and
 
03:42:15.830 --> 03:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's the final slide in the the prettier
 
03:42:18.630 --> 03:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
handout that i provided but that final
 
03:42:22.469 --> 03:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
slide you'll see that our peak
 
03:42:24.950 --> 03:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
tax rate during
 
03:42:27.590 --> 03:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
the pandemic compared to the great
 
03:42:27.600 --> 03:42:29.030 align:start position:0%
the pandemic compared to the great
recession

03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
recession
 
03:42:33.429 --> 03:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
we were about close to 40 percent lower
 
03:42:35.670 --> 03:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
40 percent lower during the pandemic
 
03:42:35.680 --> 03:42:36.870 align:start position:0%
40 percent lower during the pandemic
despite

03:42:36.870 --> 03:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
despite
 
03:42:39.189 --> 03:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
those crazy numbers of how much got paid
 
03:42:41.670 --> 03:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
out and how many people collected
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we're about 30 percent down from
 
03:42:46.309 --> 03:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
where we were
 
03:42:49.030 --> 03:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
at our peak so it's falling
 
03:42:51.510 --> 03:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's falling very quickly but again
 
03:42:52.950 --> 03:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
that's not a coincidence that's
 
03:42:52.960 --> 03:42:54.550 align:start position:0%
that's not a coincidence that's
intentional

03:42:54.550 --> 03:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
intentional
 
03:42:57.349 --> 03:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
you folks approved changes as part of
 
03:42:59.429 --> 03:42:59.439 align:start position:0%
the budget trailer bill
 
03:43:04.550 --> 03:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
we previously had as one of our solvency
 
03:43:08.790 --> 03:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
controls on our trust fund that when the
 
03:43:09.990 --> 03:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
fund fell
 
03:43:13.349 --> 03:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
there were two 0.5 surcharges that were
 
03:43:15.670 --> 03:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
added to an employer's tax rate both of
 
03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
those have been eliminated as part of
 
03:43:20.550 --> 03:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
the most recent budget
 
03:43:22.630 --> 03:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
and in exchange for that
 
03:43:22.640 --> 03:43:23.590 align:start position:0%
and in exchange for that
the

03:43:23.590 --> 03:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:43:23.600 --> 03:43:24.710 align:start position:0%
the
triggers

03:43:24.710 --> 03:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
triggers
 
03:43:27.750 --> 03:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
or the balance thresholds in the trust
 
03:43:30.389 --> 03:43:30.399 align:start position:0%
fund at which employers get reductions
 
03:43:32.710 --> 03:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
to their rate were adjusted
 
03:43:36.070 --> 03:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
right now an employer gets a 0.5 percent
 
03:43:38.469 --> 03:43:38.479 align:start position:0%
reduction to their rate
 
03:43:40.630 --> 03:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
when the fund equals or exceeds 250
 
03:43:42.150 --> 03:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars over the course of a
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
quarter new employers start at 2.7
 
03:43:47.590 --> 03:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
percent so a 0.5 reduction is
 
03:43:47.600 --> 03:43:49.429 align:start position:0%
percent so a 0.5 reduction is
significant

03:43:49.429 --> 03:43:49.439 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:43:52.150 --> 03:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
employers then get a one-point reduction
 
03:43:54.870 --> 03:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
when the fund equals or exceeds 350
 
03:43:58.630 --> 03:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars and they get a full 1.5
 
03:44:00.870 --> 03:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
reduction max reduction when the fund
 
03:44:03.990 --> 03:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
equals or exceeds 400 million dollars
 
03:44:06.550 --> 03:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
that 250 million dollar level was not
 
03:44:08.309 --> 03:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
touched as part of
 
03:44:10.790 --> 03:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
what was uh changed in the budget the
 
03:44:12.710 --> 03:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
second and third levels were they were
 
03:44:14.550 --> 03:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
adjusted up and that was the give and
 
03:44:17.990 --> 03:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
take of getting rid of the surcharges
 
03:44:20.070 --> 03:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
in exchange for allowing the fund to
 
03:44:22.950 --> 03:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
grow to a more realistic solvent amount
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
during a time when employers would be
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
better able and better able to afford
 
03:44:30.950 --> 03:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
supporting the fund rather than hitting
 
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
them with surcharges during times when
 
03:44:35.830 --> 03:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
they can least afford it um
 
03:44:39.110 --> 03:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
we paid out 350 million dollars in ui
 
03:44:39.120 --> 03:44:40.389 align:start position:0%
we paid out 350 million dollars in ui
payments

03:44:40.389 --> 03:44:40.399 align:start position:0%
payments
 
03:44:42.870 --> 03:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
a regular state ui
 
03:44:45.429 --> 03:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
03:44:47.349 --> 03:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
there was a discussion earlier about
 
03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility for self-employed
 
03:44:48.960 --> 03:44:50.229 align:start position:0%
eligibility for self-employed
individuals

03:44:50.229 --> 03:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
03:44:52.150 --> 03:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
self-employed individuals
 
03:44:54.150 --> 03:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
were never paid benefits out of the
 
03:44:56.309 --> 03:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
state trust fund
 
03:44:58.309 --> 03:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
self-employed individuals were paid out
 
03:45:00.950 --> 03:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
of one of the federal cares act programs
 
03:45:04.150 --> 03:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh so self-employed did not impact the
 
03:45:06.469 --> 03:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire trust fund from that
 
03:45:08.790 --> 03:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
perspective our current balance we are
 
03:45:12.469 --> 03:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
at 195 million dollars
 
03:45:12.479 --> 03:45:13.510 align:start position:0%
at 195 million dollars
we

03:45:13.510 --> 03:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
never borrowed
 
03:45:17.189 --> 03:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire did borrow during the
 
03:45:20.710 --> 03:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
great recession we did not borrow
 
03:45:22.389 --> 03:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
03:45:24.309 --> 03:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
according to our current forecast right
 
03:45:27.309 --> 03:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
now we are forecast to end this year at
 
03:45:29.269 --> 03:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
285 million
 
03:45:34.710 --> 03:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh and will end 2023 at 319 million
 
03:45:37.429 --> 03:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
and then 2024 for what it's worth
 
03:45:39.269 --> 03:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
looking that far ahead
 
03:45:42.630 --> 03:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
we forecast to end at 354
 
03:45:42.640 --> 03:45:44.150 align:start position:0%
we forecast to end at 354
million

03:45:44.150 --> 03:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:45:46.309 --> 03:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
and we are forecasting that that first
 
03:45:49.189 --> 03:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
0.5 percent reduction to employer tax
 
03:45:51.830 --> 03:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
rates will kick in in the first quarter
 
03:45:53.429 --> 03:45:53.439 align:start position:0%
of 2023
 
03:45:55.990 --> 03:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
typically your most expensive quarter
 
03:45:58.469 --> 03:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
so that's very timely for employers but
 
03:46:00.630 --> 03:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's what we're currently
 
03:46:02.469 --> 03:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
forecasting um
 
03:46:04.389 --> 03:46:04.399 align:start position:0%
with regard to when those fund balance
 
03:46:06.830 --> 03:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
reductions come back in
 
03:46:08.469 --> 03:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
i was a little bit all over the place
 
03:46:11.269 --> 03:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
with a lot of information there i
 
03:46:13.269 --> 03:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
apologize for that uh this bill does
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
touch upon a lot of areas with solvency
 
03:46:18.389 --> 03:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
with duration um but i wanted to make
 
03:46:21.110 --> 03:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
sure that the the committee um
 
03:46:22.790 --> 03:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
have that information and certainly can
 
03:46:24.469 --> 03:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
answer questions now and i'll be here
 
03:46:26.229 --> 03:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
throughout the duration of today's
 
03:46:28.469 --> 03:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
hearing um so as other questions come up
 
03:46:30.150 --> 03:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
i'll be more than happy to try to answer
 
03:46:33.189 --> 03:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:33.199 --> 03:46:34.830 align:start position:0%
 
already

03:46:34.830 --> 03:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:46:37.510 --> 03:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
then questions representative avalani
 
03:46:40.870 --> 03:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
and then representative cahill
 
03:46:43.030 --> 03:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative cahill your
 
03:46:44.710 --> 03:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
your your counter your fellow
 
03:46:46.150 --> 03:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
representative will yield his time
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:59.910 --> 03:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr lavers
 
03:46:59.920 --> 03:47:02.229 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr lavers
so

03:47:02.229 --> 03:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:04.550 --> 03:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
is it is it fair to understand my
 
03:47:06.150 --> 03:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
understanding of what you're telling us
 
03:47:08.150 --> 03:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire unemployment
 
03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
system is working well
 
03:47:12.950 --> 03:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
and serving the needs of both employers
 
03:47:15.429 --> 03:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
and employees when they should be when
 
03:47:18.229 --> 03:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
circumstances change which may happen
 
03:47:20.150 --> 03:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
more than once a year that something
 
03:47:21.990 --> 03:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
could happen that uh
 
03:47:23.990 --> 03:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
that would make the as you as you
 
03:47:26.550 --> 03:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
decided in the example the the covid
 
03:47:28.550 --> 03:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
thing we would have 12 weeks under this
 
03:47:30.389 --> 03:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
legislation which which obviously would
 
03:47:35.349 --> 03:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
not be enough are we doing okay as it is
 
03:47:37.429 --> 03:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
um well i have
 
03:47:39.110 --> 03:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
if the question is whether or not the
 
03:47:40.550 --> 03:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
unemployment program is currently
 
03:47:42.070 --> 03:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
performing well i have somewhat of a
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
vested interest
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
in that as i sit uh you know second in
 
03:47:48.389 --> 03:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
charge to commissioner capatis over that
 
03:47:49.910 --> 03:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
program yes
 
03:47:51.750 --> 03:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
i do believe the unemployment program is
 
03:47:53.910 --> 03:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
performing well and has served uh the
 
03:47:55.429 --> 03:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire well over the
 
03:47:57.110 --> 03:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
course of the pandemic
 
03:47:59.110 --> 03:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:48:01.110 --> 03:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh then you're familiar with the phrase
 
03:48:05.670 --> 03:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:09.189 --> 03:48:09.199 align:start position:0%
yes very familiar with that thank you
 
03:48:09.199 --> 03:48:11.510 align:start position:0%
yes very familiar with that thank you
representative

03:48:11.510 --> 03:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:48:12.830 --> 03:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you deputy
 
03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner i have a couple questions
 
03:48:16.309 --> 03:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
could you um
 
03:48:19.110 --> 03:48:19.120 align:start position:0%
tell us the difference between the total
 
03:48:20.870 --> 03:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate and the insured
 
03:48:22.950 --> 03:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate
 
03:48:25.030 --> 03:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
03:48:27.030 --> 03:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that was
 
03:48:28.950 --> 03:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
an issue or
 
03:48:31.510 --> 03:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
not an issue but a
 
03:48:34.389 --> 03:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
clarification that the letter the email
 
03:48:36.389 --> 03:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
back from the us department of labor had
 
03:48:38.150 --> 03:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
pointed out so
 
03:48:40.070 --> 03:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
your total unemployment rate is the
 
03:48:41.750 --> 03:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate measured for your
 
03:48:45.349 --> 03:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
entire labor force that is the
 
03:48:47.269 --> 03:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
number that people are more familiar
 
03:48:47.279 --> 03:48:48.469 align:start position:0%
number that people are more familiar
with

03:48:48.469 --> 03:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:48:50.229 --> 03:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
those folks here that are familiar with
 
03:48:53.030 --> 03:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
the insured unemployment rate
 
03:48:55.510 --> 03:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
i pity you that's a terrible thing that
 
03:48:58.550 --> 03:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
you're spending your time um in that far
 
03:49:00.950 --> 03:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
and deep into the weeds like myself
 
03:49:03.670 --> 03:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
but the total unemployment rate is the
 
03:49:07.110 --> 03:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
number of unemployed as a percentage of
 
03:49:09.349 --> 03:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
the total labor force
 
03:49:11.830 --> 03:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
and that is based on that point in time
 
03:49:14.469 --> 03:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
survey uh conducted each month where
 
03:49:17.590 --> 03:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
they ask those households questions
 
03:49:21.349 --> 03:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
as to whether you are working and if not
 
03:49:21.359 --> 03:49:22.309 align:start position:0%
as to whether you are working and if not
when

03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:49:23.590 --> 03:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
did you last
 
03:49:25.349 --> 03:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
actively search for work and that
 
03:49:28.150 --> 03:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
determines whether you are employed
 
03:49:30.150 --> 03:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
unemployed or not
 
03:49:32.229 --> 03:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
in the labor force total unemployment
 
03:49:34.469 --> 03:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
rate is the number that are indicated as
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
unemployed as part of that survey the
 
03:49:40.150 --> 03:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
insured unemployment rate is calculated
 
03:49:40.160 --> 03:49:41.510 align:start position:0%
insured unemployment rate is calculated
weekly

03:49:41.510 --> 03:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
weekly
 
03:49:44.150 --> 03:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
and we look at the number of people that
 
03:49:47.110 --> 03:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
are filing for unemployment
 
03:49:50.070 --> 03:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of the total number of
 
03:49:52.150 --> 03:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
workers that are covered by unemployment
 
03:49:53.830 --> 03:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
insurance taxes
 
03:49:53.840 --> 03:49:55.510 align:start position:0%
insurance taxes
so

03:49:55.510 --> 03:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:57.750 --> 03:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with different numerator
 
03:50:00.389 --> 03:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
and denominators there
 
03:50:02.790 --> 03:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
and kind of coming at that issue a
 
03:50:05.110 --> 03:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
little bit differently
 
03:50:07.349 --> 03:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
and uh that was again something that u.s
 
03:50:09.269 --> 03:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
department of labor had pointed to in
 
03:50:14.550 --> 03:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:15.750 --> 03:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chairman thank you
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
again deputy laborers for the follow-up
 
03:50:17.760 --> 03:50:18.950 align:start position:0%
again deputy laborers for the follow-up
um

03:50:18.950 --> 03:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:22.469 --> 03:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
would the iur be
 
03:50:25.429 --> 03:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:28.229 --> 03:50:28.239 align:start position:0%
follower um
 
03:50:30.389 --> 03:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
in case we need to pivot
 
03:50:31.750 --> 03:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
quickly like we had to do during the
 
03:50:33.429 --> 03:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
pandemic where we had an automatic
 
03:50:35.189 --> 03:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
shutoff of workers
 
03:50:38.070 --> 03:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
on unemployment within a matter of 24 48
 
03:50:39.910 --> 03:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
72 hours
 
03:50:39.920 --> 03:50:42.150 align:start position:0%
72 hours
within

03:50:42.150 --> 03:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
within
 
03:50:45.990 --> 03:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
a week you guys were inundated
 
03:50:47.750 --> 03:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
i know some of those people were would
 
03:50:47.760 --> 03:50:48.550 align:start position:0%
i know some of those people were would
be

03:50:48.550 --> 03:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:50:51.429 --> 03:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
would need more than 12 weeks
 
03:50:53.030 --> 03:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
but the snapshot would be from the
 
03:50:53.040 --> 03:50:54.870 align:start position:0%
but the snapshot would be from the
previous

03:50:54.870 --> 03:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
previous
 
03:50:56.469 --> 03:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
you know quarters
 
03:50:59.429 --> 03:50:59.439 align:start position:0%
would that allow you to
 
03:51:01.590 --> 03:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
move that number quicker so they can you
 
03:51:03.990 --> 03:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
can extend it out past the 12 weeks to
 
03:51:04.000 --> 03:51:06.229 align:start position:0%
can extend it out past the 12 weeks to
more

03:51:06.229 --> 03:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:51:06.239 --> 03:51:07.110 align:start position:0%
more
needed

03:51:07.110 --> 03:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
needed
 
03:51:08.710 --> 03:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
the length of time because i know a lot
 
03:51:12.790 --> 03:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:14.389 --> 03:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
you know it's a
 
03:51:16.790 --> 03:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent question um
 
03:51:18.550 --> 03:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
so the states that do have variable
 
03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
duration they tend to utilize
 
03:51:24.630 --> 03:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
um the total unemployment rate um as
 
03:51:24.640 --> 03:51:25.990 align:start position:0%
um the total unemployment rate um as
their

03:51:25.990 --> 03:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:51:28.309 --> 03:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
control or their index along with
 
03:51:28.319 --> 03:51:29.189 align:start position:0%
control or their index along with
the

03:51:29.189 --> 03:51:29.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:51:32.309 --> 03:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
base period earnings from an individual
 
03:51:36.870 --> 03:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
however the extended benefit program
 
03:51:38.550 --> 03:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
one of the programs that kind of got
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
overshadowed during the pandemic but
 
03:51:41.830 --> 03:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
kicked in and was available to
 
03:51:43.670 --> 03:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
individuals this is the long-standing
 
03:51:46.309 --> 03:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
federal state partnership program that
 
03:51:48.389 --> 03:51:48.399 align:start position:0%
individuals can get an additional
 
03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
amount of time collecting unemployment
 
03:51:52.870 --> 03:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
beyond the state made available weeks
 
03:51:57.189 --> 03:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
typically this is a 50-50 shared program
 
03:51:59.590 --> 03:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
state pays half federal government pays
 
03:51:59.600 --> 03:52:00.469 align:start position:0%
state pays half federal government pays
half

03:52:00.469 --> 03:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
half
 
03:52:02.309 --> 03:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
great recession when it kicked in
 
03:52:03.830 --> 03:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
federal government picked up the whole
 
03:52:03.840 --> 03:52:04.710 align:start position:0%
federal government picked up the whole
bill

03:52:04.710 --> 03:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:52:06.790 --> 03:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic when it kicked in
 
03:52:08.229 --> 03:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
the federal government picked up the
 
03:52:09.429 --> 03:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
whole bill
 
03:52:12.229 --> 03:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
the extended benefit program that that
 
03:52:13.830 --> 03:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
adds weeks on
 
03:52:16.630 --> 03:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
that utilizes the insured unemployment
 
03:52:16.640 --> 03:52:17.750 align:start position:0%
that utilizes the insured unemployment
rate

03:52:17.750 --> 03:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
rate
 
03:52:21.030 --> 03:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
it looks at your average over the prior
 
03:52:22.950 --> 03:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
13 weeks
 
03:52:26.309 --> 03:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
and if that is and have to go back in
 
03:52:28.870 --> 03:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
and look at this but if that gets to a
 
03:52:30.950 --> 03:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
certain threshold
 
03:52:33.349 --> 03:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
then you would have an additional 13
 
03:52:35.830 --> 03:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
weeks of unemployment available in your
 
03:52:35.840 --> 03:52:37.030 align:start position:0%
weeks of unemployment available in your
state

03:52:37.030 --> 03:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:52:39.510 --> 03:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
it also looks at whether or not that
 
03:52:42.309 --> 03:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
average over the prior 13 was at least
 
03:52:46.309 --> 03:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
120 percent of your iur over a certain
 
03:52:48.150 --> 03:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
defined prior period
 
03:52:50.150 --> 03:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
so it's not as cut and dry as just
 
03:52:52.150 --> 03:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
looking at those 13 weeks
 
03:52:54.790 --> 03:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
but then it also does if you get to
 
03:52:58.070 --> 03:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
high unemployment unemployment um and
 
03:53:01.670 --> 03:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
you uh your iur over that period exceeds
 
03:53:03.110 --> 03:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
six percent
 
03:53:05.429 --> 03:53:05.439 align:start position:0%
i believe uh you then qualify for an
 
03:53:07.189 --> 03:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
additional 20 weeks
 
03:53:07.199 --> 03:53:09.429 align:start position:0%
additional 20 weeks
so

03:53:09.429 --> 03:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:53:09.439 --> 03:53:10.389 align:start position:0%
so
states

03:53:10.389 --> 03:53:10.399 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:53:12.469 --> 03:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
have variable duration using total
 
03:53:14.630 --> 03:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate the extended benefit
 
03:53:17.349 --> 03:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
program uses the iur
 
03:53:21.349 --> 03:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:22.790 --> 03:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:53:24.950 --> 03:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
you know we do also have to remember
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
that the the total unemployment rate the
 
03:53:29.189 --> 03:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
numbers that we've been releasing uh
 
03:53:30.309 --> 03:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
folks that have been looking at the
 
03:53:32.550 --> 03:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
actual labor force numbers
 
03:53:33.910 --> 03:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
you've probably been scratching your
 
03:53:36.389 --> 03:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
head as to wondering why is this number
 
03:53:39.269 --> 03:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
so significantly lower specifically the
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
number of people working
 
03:53:43.429 --> 03:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
why is this so far below
 
03:53:47.590 --> 03:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
where we were prior to the pandemic
 
03:53:49.110 --> 03:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
those individuals that are out of the
 
03:53:51.110 --> 03:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
labor force aren't picked up
 
03:53:54.389 --> 03:53:54.399 align:start position:0%
by the the total unemployment rate
 
03:53:57.110 --> 03:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as the region and the the
 
03:53:59.670 --> 03:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
country right now are dealing with labor
 
03:54:03.590 --> 03:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
force participation rates that are lower
 
03:54:07.110 --> 03:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
we're looking at uh probably about uh
 
03:54:08.790 --> 03:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
when after our
 
03:54:10.790 --> 03:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh the benchmarking process that i
 
03:54:12.150 --> 03:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
described earlier after that is
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
completed for the 2021 rates uh new
 
03:54:16.710 --> 03:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire's labor force will be off
 
03:54:19.110 --> 03:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
probably by about two percent
 
03:54:20.870 --> 03:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh from where we were prior to the
 
03:54:20.880 --> 03:54:22.229 align:start position:0%
uh from where we were prior to the
pandemic

03:54:22.229 --> 03:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
03:54:24.950 --> 03:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
and so you're talking 15 to 20 000
 
03:54:28.710 --> 03:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
individuals a significant number for a
 
03:54:31.110 --> 03:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
state of this size so those individuals
 
03:54:33.269 --> 03:54:33.279 align:start position:0%
are not in the labor force right now
 
03:54:34.950 --> 03:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
actively trying to get them back in but
 
03:54:36.229 --> 03:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
they would they don't get picked up by
 
03:54:41.189 --> 03:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:41.199 --> 03:54:43.189 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:54:43.189 --> 03:54:43.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:54:44.469 --> 03:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you again
 
03:54:47.349 --> 03:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner um so for my math we
 
03:54:50.070 --> 03:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
have 12 weeks of state unemployment we
 
03:54:53.349 --> 03:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
have 13 weeks of a 50 50
 
03:54:56.309 --> 03:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
and then another 20 weeks based upon iur
 
03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
with another 50 50 with the federal
 
03:54:58.080 --> 03:54:59.110 align:start position:0%
with another 50 50 with the federal
government

03:54:59.110 --> 03:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:55:01.990 --> 03:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
the just to clarify with the 13 and the
 
03:55:04.950 --> 03:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
20 on the extended benefits it's a total
 
03:55:08.229 --> 03:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:10.950 --> 03:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
13 to start and then if you get to high
 
03:55:13.670 --> 03:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
unemployment they add seven to that not
 
03:55:16.309 --> 03:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
an additional 20. sorry i realize i
 
03:55:18.550 --> 03:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
didn't clarify that earlier
 
03:55:21.429 --> 03:55:21.439 align:start position:0%
thank you so just so basically you had
 
03:55:24.229 --> 03:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry mr chairman go ahead do you
 
03:55:26.150 --> 03:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
have you could have
 
03:55:28.070 --> 03:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
32 weeks of unemployment with the
 
03:55:29.670 --> 03:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
federal government picking up some and
 
03:55:31.429 --> 03:55:31.439 align:start position:0%
the state picking up some
 
03:55:33.349 --> 03:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
overall with the extended benefit
 
03:55:37.910 --> 03:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
program yes um and there's also um
 
03:55:39.590 --> 03:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:55:41.590 --> 03:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
just to
 
03:55:42.469 --> 03:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
03:55:45.990 --> 03:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know my testimony is comprehensive
 
03:55:48.150 --> 03:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
and balanced
 
03:55:50.469 --> 03:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
during the the pandemic as occurred
 
03:55:52.309 --> 03:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
during the great recession the federal
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
government kicked in with federally
 
03:55:56.550 --> 03:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
financed programs
 
03:55:56.560 --> 03:55:58.469 align:start position:0%
financed programs
so

03:55:58.469 --> 03:55:58.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:55:59.510 --> 03:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:56:01.750 --> 03:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
what happened in the pandemic
 
03:56:03.590 --> 03:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
was not only did the federal government
 
03:56:05.990 --> 03:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
come in and provide additional benefits
 
03:56:07.510 --> 03:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
for everyone that was the six hundred
 
03:56:09.189 --> 03:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
dollars a week that got turned into the
 
03:56:11.349 --> 03:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
300 a week that got added on to your
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount
 
03:56:14.790 --> 03:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
but they came in with the pua program
 
03:56:16.389 --> 03:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
the pandemic unemployment assistance
 
03:56:16.399 --> 03:56:17.269 align:start position:0%
the pandemic unemployment assistance
program

03:56:17.269 --> 03:56:17.279 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:56:19.750 --> 03:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
and people that did not qualify for
 
03:56:22.710 --> 03:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
regular traditional unemployment
 
03:56:24.550 --> 03:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
because of a pandemic related reason
 
03:56:26.710 --> 03:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
they moved on they were on that pua
 
03:56:29.349 --> 03:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
program paid for by the feds
 
03:56:32.469 --> 03:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
and if you exhausted your state ui
 
03:56:35.510 --> 03:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
you moved on to a federally financed
 
03:56:37.590 --> 03:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
extension program
 
03:56:41.110 --> 03:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
c in our laundry list of alphabet soup
 
03:56:44.150 --> 03:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
programs from the pandemic but you moved
 
03:56:47.030 --> 03:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
on to peuc and continued to receive
 
03:56:50.070 --> 03:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
benefits after exhausting state ui
 
03:56:51.990 --> 03:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
financed 100
 
03:56:55.030 --> 03:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
by the federal government now um the
 
03:56:56.710 --> 03:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
downside to that is you're depending on
 
03:56:59.590 --> 03:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
the federal government um so there is
 
03:57:01.269 --> 03:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a risk
 
03:57:03.670 --> 03:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
in um
 
03:57:06.070 --> 03:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
basing the number of weeks available
 
03:57:08.630 --> 03:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
basing that on a dependency or reliance
 
03:57:10.229 --> 03:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
upon the federal government coming
 
03:57:10.239 --> 03:57:11.030 align:start position:0%
upon the federal government coming
through

03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
through
 
03:57:13.590 --> 03:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
with a program that's going to provide
 
03:57:16.389 --> 03:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
benefits once your state program
 
03:57:17.910 --> 03:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
terminates but
 
03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's what the federal government did
 
03:57:21.349 --> 03:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic that's what they did
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
during the great recession as well
 
03:57:25.510 --> 03:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take one no i'd like to
 
03:57:27.670 --> 03:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
take one last question this is
 
03:57:29.269 --> 03:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh we have other people in these folks
 
03:57:30.710 --> 03:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
who this is there's a lot of different
 
03:57:32.550 --> 03:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
questions i'm not sure
 
03:57:32.560 --> 03:57:33.510 align:start position:0%
questions i'm not sure
well

03:57:33.510 --> 03:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:57:36.070 --> 03:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna just please please
 
03:57:37.910 --> 03:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
be brief we can always talk to the
 
03:57:39.750 --> 03:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner after deputy commissioner
 
03:57:42.309 --> 03:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
afterwards so um be brief so we can get
 
03:57:43.750 --> 03:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
the other speakers then we can go back
 
03:57:43.760 --> 03:57:44.710 align:start position:0%
the other speakers then we can go back
to

03:57:44.710 --> 03:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:57:46.389 --> 03:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
um deputy commissioner if we want
 
03:57:47.750 --> 03:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
because we do have other hearings to go
 
03:57:49.189 --> 03:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
to representative medville you're all
 
03:57:54.790 --> 03:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:56.790 --> 03:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:57:59.189 --> 03:57:59.199 align:start position:0%
you went into detail about the extended
 
03:58:03.670 --> 03:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
benefits that kick in after the 26 weeks
 
03:58:06.070 --> 03:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
how would those extended benefits work
 
03:58:07.429 --> 03:58:07.439 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
03:58:08.710 --> 03:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
03:58:11.670 --> 03:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
obviously has far fewer weeks
 
03:58:13.510 --> 03:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
um so the way that
 
03:58:15.990 --> 03:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
the extended benefit program works is
 
03:58:18.870 --> 03:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
and i'll make sure to provide the
 
03:58:20.790 --> 03:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
statutory site to members so they can
 
03:58:22.309 --> 03:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
review that as well
 
03:58:24.070 --> 03:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
but the extended benefit program kicks
 
03:58:25.990 --> 03:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
in when the state's insured unemployment
 
03:58:28.710 --> 03:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
rate averaged over those that 13-week
 
03:58:32.150 --> 03:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
period equals or exceeds
 
03:58:34.469 --> 03:58:34.479 align:start position:0%
i believe it's set the first level at
 
03:58:36.550 --> 03:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
three and a half percent
 
03:58:38.229 --> 03:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
our insured unemployment rate right now
 
03:58:40.389 --> 03:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
is a half percent because again remember
 
03:58:41.670 --> 03:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
we're only measuring the number of
 
03:58:44.710 --> 03:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
people filing each week as a
 
03:58:46.710 --> 03:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
component of total number of workers
 
03:58:49.590 --> 03:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
covered by unemployment insurance
 
03:58:49.600 --> 03:58:52.150 align:start position:0%
covered by unemployment insurance
so

03:58:52.150 --> 03:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:55.670 --> 03:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
with the three and a half percent i
 
03:58:57.269 --> 03:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
average iur
 
03:58:59.510 --> 03:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
that would kick in the first level of 13
 
03:59:03.110 --> 03:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
weeks and if your iur was averaged
 
03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
i believe it's at
 
03:59:06.950 --> 03:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
six percent but again i need to look at
 
03:59:09.910 --> 03:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
all right here if i had it all memorized
 
03:59:14.229 --> 03:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
then i could go right to the page
 
03:59:14.239 --> 03:59:15.110 align:start position:0%
then i could go right to the page
um

03:59:15.110 --> 03:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:17.910 --> 03:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
but i'm not that good um but once you
 
03:59:20.309 --> 03:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
get to uh that six percent average iur
 
03:59:23.349 --> 03:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
over those 13 weeks then the then 20
 
03:59:25.429 --> 03:59:25.439 align:start position:0%
weeks would be available and again it's
 
03:59:25.439 --> 03:59:26.469 align:start position:0%
weeks would be available and again it's
that

03:59:26.469 --> 03:59:26.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:59:28.389 --> 03:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
shared financing so half would come out
 
03:59:30.229 --> 03:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
of the unemployment trust fund our state
 
03:59:32.150 --> 03:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
trust fund and half would come from the
 
03:59:35.990 --> 03:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:39.429 --> 03:59:39.439 align:start position:0%
i understand the 13 and the 20 um what i
 
03:59:42.630 --> 03:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
what i'm not sure of is um
 
03:59:44.469 --> 03:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
whether those would kick in after let's
 
03:59:46.229 --> 03:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
say i think at one point you said the
 
03:59:47.990 --> 03:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
calculated rate according to these
 
03:59:50.070 --> 03:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
percentages would be 12 weeks
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
so basically you would have 13 and 20 on
 
03:59:54.790 --> 03:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
top of 12.
 
03:59:58.150 --> 03:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
correct it would be you would
 
04:00:01.670 --> 04:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the program hierarchy
 
04:00:03.990 --> 04:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
you would move on to extended benefits
 
04:00:10.150 --> 04:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:11.510 --> 04:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your indulgence mr
 
04:00:11.520 --> 04:00:12.389 align:start position:0%
thank you for your indulgence mr
chairman

04:00:12.389 --> 04:00:12.399 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:00:15.750 --> 04:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you deputy secretary lavers so
 
04:00:18.070 --> 04:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh regardless of how many weeks there
 
04:00:18.080 --> 04:00:18.950 align:start position:0%
uh regardless of how many weeks there
are

04:00:18.950 --> 04:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:00:20.830 --> 04:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
uh with our
 
04:00:24.389 --> 04:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
427.00 maximum nobody's getting is true
 
04:00:25.990 --> 04:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
that no one is getting that comfortable
 
04:00:27.429 --> 04:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
and staying out of work i mean you tell
 
04:00:29.670 --> 04:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
us if the average is 12 weeks or 15
 
04:00:31.910 --> 04:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
weeks that's not a long time to be out
 
04:00:33.670 --> 04:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
of work because you rex you're not
 
04:00:35.590 --> 04:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
making enough to make your bills with
 
04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
our unemployment payment correct
 
04:00:41.349 --> 04:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
the in the current average weekly
 
04:00:42.630 --> 04:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
benefit amount in new hampshire i did
 
04:00:45.110 --> 04:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
tell you earlier the average or the the
 
04:00:47.429 --> 04:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
maximum amount available is 427 the
 
04:00:49.510 --> 04:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
average weekly benefit amount right now
 
04:00:52.550 --> 04:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire's 303 dollars
 
04:00:54.389 --> 04:00:54.399 align:start position:0%
that just goes to show you that
 
04:00:56.550 --> 04:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of folks from
 
04:00:59.110 --> 04:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
lower paying sectors
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
that are collecting so think of
 
04:01:03.030 --> 04:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
hospitality think of retail
 
04:01:04.710 --> 04:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
those folks tend to have
 
04:01:08.150 --> 04:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
lower average weekly wages hence a lower
 
04:01:10.389 --> 04:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
average weekly benefit
 
04:01:13.670 --> 04:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
amount right now 303 dollars
 
04:01:15.910 --> 04:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
so even at as i'd indicated before the
 
04:01:18.309 --> 04:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
427 which is our maximum weekly benefit
 
04:01:20.710 --> 04:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
amount available in the state
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
that's about a 31 percent wage
 
04:01:24.550 --> 04:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
replacement rate for individuals earning
 
04:01:27.030 --> 04:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
at the state private sector average
 
04:01:27.040 --> 04:01:27.990 align:start position:0%
at the state private sector average
weekly

04:01:27.990 --> 04:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
weekly
 
04:01:28.000 --> 04:01:29.910 align:start position:0%
weekly
wage

04:01:29.910 --> 04:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
wage
 
04:01:53.510 --> 04:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:56.070 --> 04:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chairman infantine
 
04:01:56.080 --> 04:01:57.510 align:start position:0%

associated general contractors of new
hampshire

04:02:10.150 --> 04:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:02:11.670 --> 04:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today
 
04:02:11.680 --> 04:02:12.950 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today
completely

04:02:12.950 --> 04:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
completely
 
04:02:15.269 --> 04:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
understanding the concept of the bill
 
04:02:17.189 --> 04:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
before you
 
04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
but i think it has some unintended
 
04:02:19.520 --> 04:02:21.110 align:start position:0%
but i think it has some unintended
consequences

04:02:21.110 --> 04:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
04:02:23.670 --> 04:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
and it came to light when we reviewed
 
04:02:25.990 --> 04:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
the bill with the construction industry
 
04:02:28.710 --> 04:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
of who i represent
 
04:02:31.910 --> 04:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
we have seasonal workers in some of our
 
04:02:34.630 --> 04:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
industries within construction
 
04:02:37.110 --> 04:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
we can't work during the winter because
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
of the colder temperatures
 
04:02:41.349 --> 04:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
it's no fault of the employee it's no
 
04:02:43.269 --> 04:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
fault of the company
 
04:02:43.279 --> 04:02:44.070 align:start position:0%
fault of the company
but

04:02:44.070 --> 04:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
many of those individuals go on
 
04:02:48.070 --> 04:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment they still are required to
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
look for work
 
04:02:51.429 --> 04:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
do all of those things
 
04:02:54.389 --> 04:02:54.399 align:start position:0%
but the time frame of cutting this to 12
 
04:02:54.399 --> 04:02:55.590 align:start position:0%
but the time frame of cutting this to 12
weeks

04:02:55.590 --> 04:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
04:02:57.830 --> 04:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
we know the winter is somewhere between
 
04:03:01.030 --> 04:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
16 and 20 weeks for seasonal employment
 
04:03:02.790 --> 04:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to for our construction
 
04:03:05.590 --> 04:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
workers in new hampshire
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
we see this cut as maybe a
 
04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's problematic for the industry in the
 
04:03:13.110 --> 04:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
sense of encouraging people to come to
 
04:03:15.189 --> 04:03:15.199 align:start position:0%
our industry and work for say highway
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
work and paving
 
04:03:19.110 --> 04:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
that they know they're going to end up
 
04:03:20.790 --> 04:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
being laid off
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
they know that if you reduce it they
 
04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
won't get even the small amount that we
 
04:03:28.389 --> 04:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
were talking about in the benefit that
 
04:03:31.030 --> 04:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
to help hold them over to it but i think
 
04:03:32.469 --> 04:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
04:03:34.469 --> 04:03:34.479 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt my years of working
 
04:03:37.110 --> 04:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
with the unemployment department
 
04:03:39.189 --> 04:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
the different tables the different
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
benefits the way it works and calculated
 
04:03:46.229 --> 04:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
it's not an easy system in the sense to
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
come completely comprehend
 
04:03:51.429 --> 04:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
but we do
 
04:03:51.439 --> 04:03:53.269 align:start position:0%
but we do
businesses

04:03:53.269 --> 04:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:03:53.279 --> 04:03:54.630 align:start position:0%
businesses
the

04:03:54.630 --> 04:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:03:54.640 --> 04:03:55.670 align:start position:0%
the
state

04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
i can tell you in 2008 a lot of people
 
04:03:59.590 --> 04:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
come together because when we had the
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
last crisis trying to figure out how to
 
04:04:02.469 --> 04:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
04:04:04.710 --> 04:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
the system stays alive so
 
04:04:06.950 --> 04:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
i've been there when some of these other
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
disasters covid was
 
04:04:11.110 --> 04:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
not something we were gathered by
 
04:04:12.790 --> 04:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
businesses because the federal
 
04:04:15.189 --> 04:04:15.199 align:start position:0%
government came in and stepped in and uh
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
helped but
 
04:04:18.710 --> 04:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
based on
 
04:04:21.110 --> 04:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
how this reads at the moment
 
04:04:23.110 --> 04:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
we don't support it we oppose the
 
04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
legislation but it's really because of
 
04:04:27.750 --> 04:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
the seasonal piece there may be ways to
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
address it and we'd be glad to work with
 
04:04:32.389 --> 04:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and legislators if there is
 
04:04:33.990 --> 04:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
a way to
 
04:04:36.070 --> 04:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
to work with that but i think
 
04:04:37.910 --> 04:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
we understand how it would benefit
 
04:04:40.710 --> 04:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
businesses by if you paid less and less
 
04:04:40.720 --> 04:04:41.830 align:start position:0%
businesses by if you paid less and less
weeks

04:04:41.830 --> 04:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
04:04:43.269 --> 04:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
the whole thing the system
 
04:04:45.269 --> 04:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
mathematically but we understand the
 
04:04:47.670 --> 04:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
concept but we're concerned about this
 
04:04:47.680 --> 04:04:48.389 align:start position:0%
concept but we're concerned about this
change

04:04:48.389 --> 04:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:04:50.150 --> 04:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
and with that i would end my testimony
 
04:04:51.429 --> 04:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much for the
 
04:04:51.439 --> 04:04:53.349 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much for the
opportunity

04:04:53.349 --> 04:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
04:04:55.030 --> 04:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for mr abbott mr
 
04:04:56.870 --> 04:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
minoval representative i'm sorry
 
04:04:56.880 --> 04:04:58.710 align:start position:0%
minoval representative i'm sorry
representative

04:04:58.710 --> 04:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:05:00.070 --> 04:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
abbott um
 
04:05:01.680 --> 04:05:02.790 align:start position:0%
abbott um
what

04:05:02.790 --> 04:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
number instead of the 12 would you be
 
04:05:06.790 --> 04:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
looking for to see
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
well i think
 
04:05:08.640 --> 04:05:09.750 align:start position:0%
well i think
the

04:05:09.750 --> 04:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
the commissioner stated like what the
 
04:05:14.469 --> 04:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
average is and that's about where
 
04:05:16.870 --> 04:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
seasonal employment would be at so i'd
 
04:05:18.710 --> 04:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
be looking at that and the department
 
04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
would have the better numbers to really
 
04:05:23.590 --> 04:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
try to address this what would be the
 
04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
right number to start at and what would
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
be the right number to if you did this
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
formula i get your question i don't have
 
04:05:32.389 --> 04:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
an exact answer i'd rather have the
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
department look at
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
seasonal employers i'm not construction
 
04:05:39.110 --> 04:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
is not the only seasonal employer in the
 
04:05:41.910 --> 04:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
state there are many others and i'd want
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
all of those in that mix with that
 
04:05:45.670 --> 04:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
discussion that's
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
really the fair answer
 
04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:54.790 --> 04:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
just having some fun guys uh
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth
 
04:05:58.469 --> 04:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:06:00.870 --> 04:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
your testimony one thing i'd kind of
 
04:06:03.429 --> 04:06:03.439 align:start position:0%
like you to clarify for us i know some
 
04:06:05.830 --> 04:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
people hear that you have employers with
 
04:06:07.830 --> 04:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
seasonal workers and they want them to
 
04:06:11.349 --> 04:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
go on unemployment and people imagine
 
04:06:13.349 --> 04:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
they're trying to save some money by
 
04:06:15.910 --> 04:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
asking someone else to pay but that's
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
not how the system works is not
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
completely how the system works trust me
 
04:06:21.990 --> 04:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh if you're a negative balance employer
 
04:06:23.429 --> 04:06:23.439 align:start position:0%
you pay a much higher rate with a
 
04:06:25.189 --> 04:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
different table that's why i say the
 
04:06:28.469 --> 04:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
system's not the same for each employer
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
and that's where the the commissioner
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
talks about people paid but what you
 
04:06:33.990 --> 04:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
don't see is things like us talking to
 
04:06:36.309 --> 04:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
d.o.t of whether any of our people could
 
04:06:39.269 --> 04:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
be a snowplower driver or some other
 
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
we're always looking for those
 
04:06:43.189 --> 04:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
opportunities but when there isn't
 
04:06:45.269 --> 04:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
when there just plainly isn't
 
04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
this is at least a safety net and we
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
understand that as businesses
 
04:06:51.910 --> 04:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
putting and contributing money into that
 
04:06:51.920 --> 04:06:52.950 align:start position:0%
putting and contributing money into that
system

04:06:52.950 --> 04:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
so i i think
 
04:06:56.790 --> 04:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
you're right i really appreciate the
 
04:06:58.870 --> 04:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
question because it's not the same for
 
04:07:00.790 --> 04:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
every employer and it's not the same for
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
every seasonal employer
 
04:07:05.030 --> 04:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
mr abbott for our new new members here
 
04:07:06.790 --> 04:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
would you just give me a three or four
 
04:07:08.309 --> 04:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
second tutorial to the people about what
 
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
a negative employer is because i don't
 
04:07:11.910 --> 04:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
think some of these people know um those
 
04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
are ones in which
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh their payments uh the the benefits
 
04:07:19.429 --> 04:07:19.439 align:start position:0%
two employees had exceeded so they
 
04:07:22.710 --> 04:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
jumped to another chart to pay more
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
than other employers
 
04:07:27.030 --> 04:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
i hope that explains it because i
 
04:07:28.469 --> 04:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
but basically they're taking out more
 
04:07:29.750 --> 04:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
than they put in so they get into a
 
04:07:31.030 --> 04:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
different chart and they have to pay
 
04:07:33.269 --> 04:07:33.279 align:start position:0%
more than the average yeah it's kind of
 
04:07:33.279 --> 04:07:35.110 align:start position:0%
more than the average yeah it's kind of
a

04:07:35.110 --> 04:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:07:36.309 --> 04:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
you don't want to be in the negative
 
04:07:37.990 --> 04:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
chart if you can and i think every
 
04:07:42.149 --> 04:07:42.159 align:start position:0%

of minutes uh these guys covered much of
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to cover and
 
04:08:29.189 --> 04:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
mr lavers probably has forgotten more
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
today about unemployment than i could
 
04:08:32.550 --> 04:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
will probably know in my lifetime so you
 
04:08:34.389 --> 04:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
don't need me to sit here and wax
 
04:08:36.950 --> 04:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
eloquent on the program but this is
 
04:08:39.269 --> 04:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that as an organization
 
04:08:41.110 --> 04:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
we work with states around the country
 
04:08:42.309 --> 04:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
on and we're working on a there's a
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
number of a number of bills and we work
 
04:08:46.229 --> 04:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
closely with
 
04:08:47.830 --> 04:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment agencies and legislation
 
04:08:50.710 --> 04:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
legislators in north carolina florida
 
04:08:52.710 --> 04:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
most recently tennessee the state of
 
04:08:55.510 --> 04:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
iowa on this issue specifically and for
 
04:08:57.910 --> 04:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
us it's all about
 
04:09:01.189 --> 04:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
getting people back to work and get back
 
04:09:02.870 --> 04:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
get people back to work as quickly as
 
04:09:04.790 --> 04:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
possible and so what i want to do is i
 
04:09:06.870 --> 04:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
want to just encourage you
 
04:09:06.880 --> 04:09:08.469 align:start position:0%
want to just encourage you
so

04:09:08.469 --> 04:09:08.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:10.630 --> 04:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a fantastic state it's
 
04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
a great state and
 
04:09:13.990 --> 04:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm a guy from maine proud of being from
 
04:09:16.469 --> 04:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
maine and so it it ought to mean a lot
 
04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
here and it come from somebody who who
 
04:09:20.229 --> 04:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
would like to be a competitor with new
 
04:09:21.910 --> 04:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire though i don't think we're uh
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
we're quite there but it's great for a
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
lot of reasons
 
04:09:26.870 --> 04:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
one of the big reasons is that
 
04:09:29.189 --> 04:09:29.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is one of the preeminent
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
places that says says to businesses and
 
04:09:31.680 --> 04:09:32.870 align:start position:0%
places that says says to businesses and
workers

04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
workers
 
04:09:34.550 --> 04:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
we want you here
 
04:09:36.389 --> 04:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that new hampshire serves
 
04:09:37.910 --> 04:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
as a reminder to the rest of new england
 
04:09:40.229 --> 04:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
and the entire northeast that
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
you don't need to be in the sun belt
 
04:09:44.469 --> 04:09:44.479 align:start position:0%
with warm winters and booming metro
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
areas like orlando and nashville to be a
 
04:09:49.590 --> 04:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
leading pro-business state
 
04:09:51.590 --> 04:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
you just need to continue growing in the
 
04:09:54.149 --> 04:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
principles you have that you've governed
 
04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
by over the past decades that's why
 
04:09:59.030 --> 04:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
honestly and you know this your
 
04:10:01.750 --> 04:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
competition isn't maine or vermont it's
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
not even massachusetts or connecticut
 
04:10:06.870 --> 04:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
no income tax business friendly states
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
like florida like tennessee
 
04:10:15.670 --> 04:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
like iowa around the country
 
04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
this bill hb 1337 is a statement
 
04:10:21.429 --> 04:10:21.439 align:start position:0%
that you want to be more than just the
 
04:10:23.670 --> 04:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
pro-business state of new england or the
 
04:10:25.830 --> 04:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
northeast but that you want to continue
 
04:10:26.790 --> 04:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
to lead
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
nationally on economic issue issues
 
04:10:31.030 --> 04:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
states like florida and tennessee
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
already do what this bill does
 
04:10:35.429 --> 04:10:35.439 align:start position:0%
and they've grown from it florida in
 
04:10:37.269 --> 04:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
particular tennessee just passed it and
 
04:10:39.670 --> 04:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to hash back through
 
04:10:40.950 --> 04:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
exactly how it works i'm not going to
 
04:10:42.870 --> 04:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
hash back through the benefits i think
 
04:10:45.189 --> 04:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
you've i think you've heard those
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
today already
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
but i just want to encourage you north
 
04:10:51.750 --> 04:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
carolina passed this
 
04:10:53.510 --> 04:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
and i had a had the opportunity to sit
 
04:10:55.030 --> 04:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
for a long time with the representative
 
04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
in her office and talk about
 
04:10:58.630 --> 04:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
why she worked toward this and it was
 
04:11:00.149 --> 04:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
post-great recession and they had a
 
04:11:02.389 --> 04:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
disaster on their hands so they had to
 
04:11:03.429 --> 04:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
fix it
 
04:11:05.429 --> 04:11:05.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire doesn't have a disaster on
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
its hand you guys have done a good job
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
tennessee passed it last year not
 
04:11:11.349 --> 04:11:11.359 align:start position:0%
because they had a disaster on their
 
04:11:12.870 --> 04:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
hands but because
 
04:11:14.070 --> 04:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
they want to be the best they want to
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
keep drawing businesses to their state
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
and i would encourage you as the leaders
 
04:11:21.110 --> 04:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
of the state of new hampshire to follow
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
that path and i i am happy to take any
 
04:11:30.950 --> 04:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:32.790 --> 04:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
seen thank you very much this morning
 
04:11:35.590 --> 04:11:35.600 align:start position:0%

04:11:36.950 --> 04:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
mike summers new hampshire lodging and
 
04:11:43.349 --> 04:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.950 --> 04:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chairman members of
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
04:11:47.990 --> 04:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
mike summers president ceo of the new
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire lodging restaurant association
 
04:11:52.950 --> 04:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'll be very brief um i am no expert in
 
04:11:54.790 --> 04:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
the details as uh deputy commissioner
 
04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
lavers has given you uh way more content
 
04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
that i could i didn't even absorb at all
 
04:12:01.349 --> 04:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
but uh that said i
 
04:12:03.030 --> 04:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
in discussing this bill with my board
 
04:12:04.710 --> 04:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
leadership they asked me to be here
 
04:12:06.070 --> 04:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
today and really just weigh in in
 
04:12:08.149 --> 04:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
support of this as a concept um
 
04:12:10.550 --> 04:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
obviously there are way more minutia and
 
04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
details that need to be worked out but
 
04:12:14.309 --> 04:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
they did ask me to be here to speak to
 
04:12:15.910 --> 04:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
this they feel that it's kind of a
 
04:12:17.750 --> 04:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
common sense approach it's a very new
 
04:12:19.110 --> 04:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire kind of a unique sort of
 
04:12:21.429 --> 04:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
approach um the one thing that i will
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
add in listening to uh deputy
 
04:12:24.550 --> 04:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner labors is he i think he
 
04:12:26.229 --> 04:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
alluded to the fact that maybe there is
 
04:12:28.710 --> 04:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
a way to or maybe there should be a way
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
to build in some sort of a shutoff
 
04:12:31.910 --> 04:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
switch in the event that we have another
 
04:12:31.920 --> 04:12:33.269 align:start position:0%
switch in the event that we have another
pandemic

04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
04:12:34.950 --> 04:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
as you know the hospitality industry we
 
04:12:36.870 --> 04:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
just got crushed by this thing i mean we
 
04:12:38.070 --> 04:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
were shut down
 
04:12:40.469 --> 04:12:40.479 align:start position:0%
open one day shut down the next so maybe
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
there is a way that you know within the
 
04:12:43.830 --> 04:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
system we could build some sort of a
 
04:12:46.149 --> 04:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
safety valve in there um so that is the
 
04:12:47.429 --> 04:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
only comment that i would make beyond
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
that i'm happy to answer questions and
 
04:12:55.510 --> 04:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.030 --> 04:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:07.590 --> 04:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:07.600 --> 04:13:13.269 align:start position:0%

04:13:31.990 --> 04:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know part of the problem with this
 
04:13:34.630 --> 04:13:34.640 align:start position:0%
is a structural imbalance there are some
 
04:13:36.229 --> 04:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
you know jobs that
 
04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
there's a shortage of people so
 
04:13:40.389 --> 04:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
you know it seems like
 
04:13:42.309 --> 04:13:42.319 align:start position:0%
people aren't looking for work and but
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's because people aren't qualified
 
04:13:45.269 --> 04:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
for them then there's jobs there's a
 
04:13:47.590 --> 04:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
surplus of people in so those people may
 
04:13:49.510 --> 04:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
stay unemployed longer and the
 
04:13:51.189 --> 04:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
particular thing we've found is a lot of
 
04:13:53.830 --> 04:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
our people are in their 50s and over
 
04:13:55.510 --> 04:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
there's serious discrimination against
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
older people companies just don't want
 
04:13:57.600 --> 04:13:58.710 align:start position:0%
older people companies just don't want
them

04:13:58.710 --> 04:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:14:00.630 --> 04:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
i mean i know a woman used to be a legal
 
04:14:02.229 --> 04:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
secretary she can't find that job
 
04:14:03.910 --> 04:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
anymore but she can't even get a job as
 
04:14:05.750 --> 04:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
a restaurant hostess because they want
 
04:14:09.269 --> 04:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
someone young and perky and
 
04:14:11.429 --> 04:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
another example of this is
 
04:14:13.110 --> 04:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
i used to go on plant tours before the
 
04:14:15.510 --> 04:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic and there was a high tech firm
 
04:14:17.830 --> 04:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
said we have seven jobs we can't fill
 
04:14:19.110 --> 04:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
i said well that's funny i looked at
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
your website this morning and there's
 
04:14:23.030 --> 04:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
only one job posted on how seriously
 
04:14:25.590 --> 04:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
you're trying to fill those seven jobs
 
04:14:26.630 --> 04:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:14:28.870 --> 04:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
so i think that you know this
 
04:14:31.110 --> 04:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
company saying they need workers
 
04:14:33.269 --> 04:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
is maybe a little bit
 
04:14:35.189 --> 04:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
exaggerated i mean once again i know a
 
04:14:37.990 --> 04:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
guy who can't get a job at dunkin donuts
 
04:14:40.710 --> 04:14:40.720 align:start position:0%
and so they say we need people well
 
04:14:42.149 --> 04:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
people show up but if they're over 50
 
04:14:43.510 --> 04:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
they won't hire them
 
04:14:43.520 --> 04:14:44.389 align:start position:0%
they won't hire them
so

04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:14:46.070 --> 04:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
and this is getting into something i
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
want to talk about and that is that
 
04:14:51.189 --> 04:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
as the gentleman with the seasonal work
 
04:14:53.590 --> 04:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
says you know there's different
 
04:14:55.349 --> 04:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
you know difficulties with people
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
getting work
 
04:14:58.469 --> 04:14:58.479 align:start position:0%
and if the purpose of this bill
 
04:15:01.590 --> 04:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
is to cut the state's budget well sure
 
04:15:03.830 --> 04:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
you start off by saying we'll only you
 
04:15:05.189 --> 04:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
know give the average number of weeks
 
04:15:06.630 --> 04:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
people get well let's save you half your
 
04:15:07.990 --> 04:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
money right away
 
04:15:10.229 --> 04:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
you know two more years you do it again
 
04:15:11.830 --> 04:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
you say well
 
04:15:13.830 --> 04:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
12 weeks is too long because the average
 
04:15:15.189 --> 04:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
is only eight now so we'll cut it back
 
04:15:16.710 --> 04:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
to eight and then do it to six and four
 
04:15:18.550 --> 04:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
and you know pretty soon you can
 
04:15:20.630 --> 04:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
the company don't pay anything at all if
 
04:15:22.710 --> 04:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
you want to just keep cutting it back
 
04:15:23.910 --> 04:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
but if you say you know part of the
 
04:15:25.269 --> 04:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
purpose of this is to help people who
 
04:15:28.070 --> 04:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
are unemployed and need help
 
04:15:30.149 --> 04:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
then that's kind of a mistake
 
04:15:32.309 --> 04:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
i think some people may be feeling that
 
04:15:33.670 --> 04:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
there are people who abuse the
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
unemployment system i'm sure that's true
 
04:15:38.550 --> 04:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to deny it at all
 
04:15:40.469 --> 04:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
but there are people that really need
 
04:15:40.479 --> 04:15:41.670 align:start position:0%
but there are people that really need
help

04:15:41.670 --> 04:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:15:41.680 --> 04:15:42.950 align:start position:0%
help
and

04:15:42.950 --> 04:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:15:45.189 --> 04:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
that's kind of another issue i have that
 
04:15:47.110 --> 04:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
i wanted to come here today
 
04:15:48.710 --> 04:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
i looked on the website for new
 
04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire works
 
04:15:51.510 --> 04:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
04:15:54.070 --> 04:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
job seekers interface to
 
04:15:54.080 --> 04:15:56.710 align:start position:0%
job seekers interface to
the

04:15:56.710 --> 04:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:58.389 --> 04:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
employment security
 
04:15:59.830 --> 04:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
and i discovered that their new
 
04:16:01.910 --> 04:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire works offices are open
 
04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
8 to 4 30 monday to friday
 
04:16:06.229 --> 04:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
except when i went to the office i
 
04:16:07.990 --> 04:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
discovered there was a sign on the door
 
04:16:10.149 --> 04:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
it's only open 12 to 4
 
04:16:11.590 --> 04:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
and you can only stay there for half an
 
04:16:11.600 --> 04:16:12.870 align:start position:0%
and you can only stay there for half an
hour

04:16:12.870 --> 04:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
hour
 
04:16:14.389 --> 04:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
so you know if there are these
 
04:16:15.750 --> 04:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
unemployed people that are trying to get
 
04:16:18.070 --> 04:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
help finding a job you know
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
why are we
 
04:16:21.110 --> 04:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
cutting back the
 
04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
i don't the employment assistance part
 
04:16:25.990 --> 04:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
of the department by over 50 percent now
 
04:16:27.510 --> 04:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have the real job fairs
 
04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
people can go to they have the virtual
 
04:16:32.229 --> 04:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
job fairs those are usually 11 to 1. so
 
04:16:33.670 --> 04:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
if the office doesn't even open till
 
04:16:35.510 --> 04:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
noon you already missed half the virtual
 
04:16:38.309 --> 04:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
job fair if you show up at the
 
04:16:41.590 --> 04:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire works to get a job so you
 
04:16:43.910 --> 04:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
know what i think you really need to do
 
04:16:45.670 --> 04:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
if you're afraid of these malingering
 
04:16:47.030 --> 04:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
types or whatever
 
04:16:48.469 --> 04:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
and say okay you know we'll be kind of
 
04:16:50.309 --> 04:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
generous we'll give everybody you know
 
04:16:52.229 --> 04:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
six weeks eight weeks whatever and you
 
04:16:54.389 --> 04:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
fill out the forms and that's okay
 
04:16:56.389 --> 04:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
but then once you start running over
 
04:16:59.110 --> 04:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
that let's give you some real help
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
and now maybe if you're in a seasonal
 
04:17:02.550 --> 04:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
industry that real help is going to be
 
04:17:04.389 --> 04:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
less you know well your employer is
 
04:17:05.910 --> 04:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
willing to pay a high unemployment rate
 
04:17:07.510 --> 04:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
so we're not going to really make you
 
04:17:08.630 --> 04:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
find something because they're willing
 
04:17:11.670 --> 04:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
to pay for this but
 
04:17:13.910 --> 04:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
maybe you know this person needs
 
04:17:16.070 --> 04:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
advice on getting a job maybe you need
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
to start comparing them with the jobs
 
04:17:19.510 --> 04:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
they're applying for as in if a
 
04:17:21.269 --> 04:17:21.279 align:start position:0%
restaurant that keeps claiming they're
 
04:17:23.349 --> 04:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
not getting any workers is turning these
 
04:17:25.030 --> 04:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
people down you need to go back to the
 
04:17:26.469 --> 04:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
employer and say look what's going on
 
04:17:26.479 --> 04:17:27.510 align:start position:0%
employer and say look what's going on
here

04:17:27.510 --> 04:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:17:27.520 --> 04:17:28.389 align:start position:0%
here
so

04:17:28.389 --> 04:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
i think we need to reopen the new
 
04:17:32.550 --> 04:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire works part of the
 
04:17:34.149 --> 04:17:34.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment system and i'm sure the
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner can give you some
 
04:17:39.349 --> 04:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
advice on that why it is when
 
04:17:41.510 --> 04:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
employers are short of help that we're
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
not having the offices open so people
 
04:17:45.590 --> 04:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
can apply i mean half an hour i don't
 
04:17:47.349 --> 04:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
know how much time most you people spend
 
04:17:48.870 --> 04:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
on the internet but you know just
 
04:17:50.309 --> 04:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
checking your email for job leads or
 
04:17:52.309 --> 04:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
going to a job site you probably can't
 
04:17:53.910 --> 04:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
do that in half an hour
 
04:17:55.110 --> 04:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
and then let's say you have to fill out
 
04:17:57.110 --> 04:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
an application all the applications are
 
04:17:59.189 --> 04:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
online now and they tend to take an hour
 
04:18:00.870 --> 04:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
to fill out how do you fill out an hour
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
application in half an hour and remember
 
04:18:04.469 --> 04:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
you've already used up your time just
 
04:18:06.550 --> 04:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
checking the email to find it
 
04:18:06.560 --> 04:18:07.349 align:start position:0%
checking the email to find it
so

04:18:07.349 --> 04:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:09.750 --> 04:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
i think i'll be happy to hang around and
 
04:18:11.189 --> 04:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
hear just what the deputy commissioner
 
04:18:13.269 --> 04:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
has to say about why we're not doing
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
more to help people get jobs that's the
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
way i see to cut the you know expensive
 
04:18:20.710 --> 04:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation is not simply
 
04:18:22.469 --> 04:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
to say well these people are malingerers
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
let's pay fewer weeks let's help these
 
04:18:26.710 --> 04:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
people find jobs
 
04:18:26.720 --> 04:18:27.590 align:start position:0%
people find jobs
and

04:18:27.590 --> 04:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:31.349 --> 04:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:32.790 --> 04:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
any questions for the speaker
 
04:18:34.229 --> 04:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
representative cahill i know you're
 
04:18:36.630 --> 04:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
itching ask questions
 
04:18:38.710 --> 04:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much mr chairman and
 
04:18:41.269 --> 04:18:41.279 align:start position:0%

04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
i i wanted to thank you actually because
 
04:18:45.269 --> 04:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
i earlier today i brought up the
 
04:18:47.030 --> 04:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
question about whether or not
 
04:18:48.149 --> 04:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
it was different in you know the
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate was different than
 
04:18:51.590 --> 04:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
coast and it is in rockingham and i
 
04:18:53.830 --> 04:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
really neglected to think about the age
 
04:18:55.510 --> 04:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
and the skill set of the people who were
 
04:18:57.030 --> 04:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
out of work
 
04:18:59.429 --> 04:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
so i really appreciate your coming in
 
04:19:00.790 --> 04:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
and telling us about that it's an
 
04:19:03.189 --> 04:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
important thing i i do want to defend
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
the commit the deputy commissioner i
 
04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
think they may be having trouble
 
04:19:08.550 --> 04:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
staffing like so many other people are
 
04:19:10.309 --> 04:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure he'd be willing to take
 
04:19:11.830 --> 04:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
your input so it was really more of a
 
04:19:13.830 --> 04:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
comment and a thank you than a question
 
04:19:15.750 --> 04:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
but again thank you very much can i
 
04:19:17.750 --> 04:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
04:19:19.830 --> 04:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
would you believe yes you may believe
 
04:19:19.840 --> 04:19:21.349 align:start position:0%
would you believe yes you may believe
yeah

04:19:21.349 --> 04:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:19:23.590 --> 04:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
okay i mean first off it just depends on
 
04:19:25.030 --> 04:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
how things are we used to have people
 
04:19:27.670 --> 04:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
where engineers show up because new
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire after the great recession was
 
04:19:31.269 --> 04:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
much slower to
 
04:19:33.030 --> 04:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
do construction projects
 
04:19:34.870 --> 04:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
so one of our gentlemen actually had to
 
04:19:36.309 --> 04:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
go down and work in massachusetts
 
04:19:38.149 --> 04:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
because they had much more engineering
 
04:19:38.159 --> 04:19:39.110 align:start position:0%
because they had much more engineering
work

04:19:39.110 --> 04:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:19:40.229 --> 04:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
but he lives in new hampshire and
 
04:19:41.830 --> 04:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
commutes down there every day and that's
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
kind of a wasteful resource and
 
04:19:46.950 --> 04:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
but now you know new hampshire's kind of
 
04:19:48.710 --> 04:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
caught up on that
 
04:19:51.110 --> 04:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
and you know the other thing
 
04:19:51.120 --> 04:19:52.950 align:start position:0%
and you know the other thing
is

04:19:52.950 --> 04:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:19:54.469 --> 04:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
i would be happy to hear the deputy
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner tell us that yes we have a
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
problem with resources but isn't that
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
your job if
 
04:20:01.510 --> 04:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
the reason people aren't being able to
 
04:20:03.110 --> 04:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
find work as the
 
04:20:04.710 --> 04:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
department doesn't have enough resources
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
then you've got to increase their budget
 
04:20:09.189 --> 04:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
or whatever it takes to do that
 
04:20:11.349 --> 04:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:15.030 --> 04:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:16.950 --> 04:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
cnn thank you very much
 
04:20:18.469 --> 04:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
mr berkey
 
04:20:18.479 --> 04:20:25.990 align:start position:0%
mr berkey
welcome

04:20:25.990 --> 04:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:27.269 --> 04:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman and members of the
 
04:20:29.349 --> 04:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
committee for your record bruce berkey
 
04:20:31.269 --> 04:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
with sheen finding capital group and
 
04:20:33.110 --> 04:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
here today representing
 
04:20:34.710 --> 04:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
the national federation of independent
 
04:20:37.349 --> 04:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
business over 1400 small business owners
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
here in the state of new hampshire are
 
04:20:39.359 --> 04:20:40.469 align:start position:0%
here in the state of new hampshire are
members

04:20:40.469 --> 04:20:40.479 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:20:42.550 --> 04:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
and just two points
 
04:20:45.349 --> 04:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
one is that like the new hampshire
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
lodging restaurant association we do
 
04:20:47.279 --> 04:20:48.229 align:start position:0%
lodging restaurant association we do
support

04:20:48.229 --> 04:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:20:50.229 --> 04:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
this bill in concept
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps it needs some some work with
 
04:20:55.910 --> 04:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
respect to a safety net or you know how
 
04:20:58.149 --> 04:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
it how it you know fits in with the with
 
04:20:59.590 --> 04:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
the federal uh
 
04:21:01.269 --> 04:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
you know how it's complemented by the
 
04:21:03.189 --> 04:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
federal support
 
04:21:05.189 --> 04:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
but we have seen this work in other
 
04:21:07.349 --> 04:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
states i know florida and georgia and
 
04:21:09.349 --> 04:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
tennessee have been mentioned
 
04:21:12.630 --> 04:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
um and and my counterparts with nfib
 
04:21:15.670 --> 04:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
down there have have said this is a good
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
approach to the issue
 
04:21:20.309 --> 04:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
so we support the measure
 
04:21:23.670 --> 04:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
the second point i'd like to make um
 
04:21:26.309 --> 04:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
and and it's uh not necessarily related
 
04:21:29.110 --> 04:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
to this bill directly but it is related
 
04:21:32.710 --> 04:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
to deputy commissioner labor's comments
 
04:21:32.720 --> 04:21:33.830 align:start position:0%
to deputy commissioner labor's comments
and

04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:35.990 --> 04:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
i i don't think he would take issue with
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
what he said
 
04:21:39.750 --> 04:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
but i will take issue with what he said
 
04:21:42.309 --> 04:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
when he said that he would like to try
 
04:21:43.830 --> 04:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
and forget
 
04:21:43.840 --> 04:21:44.710 align:start position:0%
and forget
about

04:21:44.710 --> 04:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:21:46.710 --> 04:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
the experience that he
 
04:21:50.229 --> 04:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
and his staff had in the spring of 2020
 
04:21:52.710 --> 04:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
i think we should all remember
 
04:21:55.670 --> 04:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
the experience that he had and his staff
 
04:21:59.189 --> 04:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
had in 2020 because they performed
 
04:22:02.149 --> 04:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
outstanding service to the state of new
 
04:22:02.159 --> 04:22:03.429 align:start position:0%
outstanding service to the state of new
hampshire

04:22:03.429 --> 04:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:22:05.670 --> 04:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
and it was just
 
04:22:07.510 --> 04:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
i've i i first worked for this new
 
04:22:09.590 --> 04:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire house in 1982
 
04:22:12.469 --> 04:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
so i've been around here for 40 years
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
i've never seen a state agency
 
04:22:18.630 --> 04:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
respond in the way that they did
 
04:22:21.349 --> 04:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
to serve the state to serve the people
 
04:22:23.830 --> 04:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the state in such a short time frame
 
04:22:27.269 --> 04:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
and in such a emergency type situation
 
04:22:30.389 --> 04:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
so i just want to publicly applaud
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
his department with the leadership of
 
04:22:34.469 --> 04:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner coppatis and deputy
 
04:22:36.309 --> 04:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner labors and the whole team
 
04:22:39.670 --> 04:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
over there thank you mr chairman
 
04:22:41.110 --> 04:22:41.120 align:start position:0%

04:22:43.590 --> 04:22:43.600 align:start position:0%

04:22:47.990 --> 04:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
berkey and thank you for saying that
 
04:22:49.349 --> 04:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
what you just stated about the
 
04:22:51.510 --> 04:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
department uh i had many many
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
constituents reach out to me
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
and mr lavers was very responsive and
 
04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
they had they have done admirable work
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
my question i would believe that
 
04:23:00.960 --> 04:23:02.070 align:start position:0%
my question i would believe that
yeah

04:23:02.070 --> 04:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:23:04.070 --> 04:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
yes my question is
 
04:23:06.309 --> 04:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
do we have a problem
 
04:23:07.990 --> 04:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
like like they said they had in florida
 
04:23:09.189 --> 04:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
and these other states do we have that
 
04:23:10.469 --> 04:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
problem here in new hampshire with
 
04:23:10.479 --> 04:23:11.429 align:start position:0%
problem here in new hampshire with
people

04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
really laying around and
 
04:23:15.110 --> 04:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
collecting lavish
 
04:23:16.630 --> 04:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits and being
 
04:23:19.590 --> 04:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
discouraged from working
 
04:23:21.910 --> 04:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
i think i i don't have any specific
 
04:23:23.590 --> 04:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
examples for you today representative
 
04:23:25.910 --> 04:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
cahill um but
 
04:23:29.189 --> 04:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
i heard some
 
04:23:31.349 --> 04:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
experiences from
 
04:23:32.950 --> 04:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
small business and medium-sized
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
businesses throughout the state of new
 
04:23:37.189 --> 04:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire during the the process
 
04:23:39.670 --> 04:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
so my answer would be yes i think we did
 
04:23:46.149 --> 04:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:47.670 --> 04:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh was that what you were referring to
 
04:23:49.670 --> 04:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
the period when the federal government
 
04:23:51.670 --> 04:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
was sending out 600 an extra six hundred
 
04:23:53.030 --> 04:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
dollars and
 
04:23:54.710 --> 04:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
allowing other people in a sort of
 
04:23:57.590 --> 04:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
unnormally uncovered employers to
 
04:23:59.189 --> 04:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
collect benefits is it the coveted
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
period you're referring to or pre-code
 
04:24:05.349 --> 04:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
it was the covet period
 
04:24:06.790 --> 04:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:24:08.830 --> 04:24:08.840 align:start position:0%

04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
a project where we've been assisting
 
04:24:56.070 --> 04:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
folks with
 
04:24:57.830 --> 04:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment access to unemployment
 
04:24:59.349 --> 04:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
benefits um
 
04:25:01.110 --> 04:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
we've had the project for a long time
 
04:25:02.950 --> 04:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's been uh
 
04:25:04.710 --> 04:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
incredibly busy over the last two years
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
trying to assist folks
 
04:25:09.189 --> 04:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
in accessing benefits and i would echo
 
04:25:11.590 --> 04:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
everyone's comments about the work that
 
04:25:13.189 --> 04:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
the department has done
 
04:25:13.199 --> 04:25:14.550 align:start position:0%
the department has done
um

04:25:14.550 --> 04:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:15.830 --> 04:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
and i was just jotting down notes and
 
04:25:17.590 --> 04:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
now i can't find them
 
04:25:17.600 --> 04:25:19.429 align:start position:0%
now i can't find them
sorry

04:25:19.429 --> 04:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:25:19.439 --> 04:25:20.469 align:start position:0%
sorry
um

04:25:20.469 --> 04:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:21.910 --> 04:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
i guess i i
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
i think what it it comes down to is that
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to kind of um
 
04:25:28.550 --> 04:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
highlight a couple things i've heard
 
04:25:30.630 --> 04:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
that i think sum up what our position is
 
04:25:32.469 --> 04:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
on the bill which is we feel like it's
 
04:25:32.479 --> 04:25:34.870 align:start position:0%
on the bill which is we feel like it's
unnecessary

04:25:34.870 --> 04:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's just it really is a solution in
 
04:25:40.469 --> 04:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
search of a problem as you've heard from
 
04:25:42.149 --> 04:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
the data that the deputy commissioner
 
04:25:42.159 --> 04:25:43.349 align:start position:0%
the data that the deputy commissioner
shared

04:25:43.349 --> 04:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
shared
 
04:25:45.670 --> 04:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
unemployment is low in our state the
 
04:25:48.070 --> 04:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
duration of people on unemployment is
 
04:25:51.269 --> 04:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
low in our state the benefit of amount
 
04:25:55.590 --> 04:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:57.670 --> 04:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
the the folks that and then this is
 
04:25:59.670 --> 04:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
getting to the kind of last points that
 
04:26:01.110 --> 04:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
folks were making
 
04:26:03.269 --> 04:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
the folks that are still on unemployment
 
04:26:05.349 --> 04:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
after 12 weeks tend to fall into two
 
04:26:07.830 --> 04:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
categories those that are older adults
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
who are having difficulty finding work
 
04:26:13.830 --> 04:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
that they're skilled for in some cases
 
04:26:16.149 --> 04:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
and then also those that have limited
 
04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
availability um based and that generally
 
04:26:22.070 --> 04:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
falls into categories of people with
 
04:26:24.389 --> 04:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
limited access to child care which i
 
04:26:26.309 --> 04:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
think everyone has probably heard about
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic it's really
 
04:26:29.670 --> 04:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult to access
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
a reliable child care
 
04:26:33.990 --> 04:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
and with even if you have reliable child
 
04:26:36.870 --> 04:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
care there are difficulties in terms of
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic
 
04:26:41.830 --> 04:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
folks having to
 
04:26:41.840 --> 04:26:43.750 align:start position:0%
folks having to
to

04:26:43.750 --> 04:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:26:43.760 --> 04:26:45.189 align:start position:0%
to
isolate

04:26:45.189 --> 04:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
isolate
 
04:26:47.110 --> 04:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
when there's exposures at the child care
 
04:26:49.110 --> 04:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
facilities etc so
 
04:26:52.309 --> 04:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:53.830 --> 04:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
the folks that we're talking about that
 
04:26:56.070 --> 04:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
are on for more than 12 weeks i think
 
04:26:59.670 --> 04:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
have specific challenges and barriers
 
04:26:59.680 --> 04:27:00.580 align:start position:0%
have specific challenges and barriers
that

04:27:00.580 --> 04:27:00.590 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:00.590 --> 04:27:01.910 align:start position:0%
that
[Music]

04:27:01.910 --> 04:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:27:03.910 --> 04:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
are i wouldn't characterize anyone who's
 
04:27:05.830 --> 04:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
on unemployment for more than 12 weeks
 
04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
as someone who is
 
04:27:09.189 --> 04:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
in any way taking advantage of that and
 
04:27:09.199 --> 04:27:09.830 align:start position:0%
in any way taking advantage of that and
i

04:27:09.830 --> 04:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:27:11.110 --> 04:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:27:12.790 --> 04:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
that i can speak to that specifically
 
04:27:14.469 --> 04:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
because the
 
04:27:16.149 --> 04:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
for two reasons one
 
04:27:18.070 --> 04:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
people are trying to make ends meet when
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
they're on unemployment they're in a
 
04:27:20.790 --> 04:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
difficult situation where they've lost
 
04:27:22.950 --> 04:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
their job and they're trying to continue
 
04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
to pay their bills feed their families
 
04:27:27.269 --> 04:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
pay for child care um
 
04:27:29.349 --> 04:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
keep their car and repair so a good
 
04:27:31.510 --> 04:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
repair so they can get to interviews etc
 
04:27:33.510 --> 04:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
and get to work et cetera
 
04:27:35.990 --> 04:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
and the fact of the matter is they can't
 
04:27:38.790 --> 04:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
afford to be unemployed as we heard
 
04:27:39.990 --> 04:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
they can't pay their bills on
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment and
 
04:27:44.469 --> 04:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
they can't afford to be even more so
 
04:27:45.910 --> 04:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
than not being unemployed they can't
 
04:27:48.790 --> 04:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
afford to be without unemployment um on
 
04:27:51.750 --> 04:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
the chance that someone is 13 14 15
 
04:27:51.760 --> 04:27:52.630 align:start position:0%
the chance that someone is 13 14 15
weeks

04:27:52.630 --> 04:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
04:27:56.550 --> 04:27:56.560 align:start position:0%
on unemployment which this bill would
 
04:27:57.670 --> 04:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
ramp back
 
04:28:00.309 --> 04:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
the folks that are on unemployment those
 
04:28:00.319 --> 04:28:01.269 align:start position:0%
the folks that are on unemployment those
extra

04:28:01.269 --> 04:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
extra
 
04:28:01.279 --> 04:28:02.229 align:start position:0%
extra
weeks

04:28:02.229 --> 04:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
you're potentially by ending that
 
04:28:04.710 --> 04:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
the ripple effect of that in terms of
 
04:28:09.429 --> 04:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
um people becoming potentially homeless
 
04:28:10.870 --> 04:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
because they're unable to pay their rent
 
04:28:13.510 --> 04:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
or their mortgage or et cetera so it can
 
04:28:16.710 --> 04:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
kind it compound the problem and
 
04:28:18.229 --> 04:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
we all know we have a housing problem in
 
04:28:19.349 --> 04:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
our state so
 
04:28:19.359 --> 04:28:20.389 align:start position:0%
our state so
um

04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:24.070 --> 04:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
i guess i would just say that uh
 
04:28:26.710 --> 04:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
we again we we think this is just a bill
 
04:28:28.309 --> 04:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
that's a solution in search of a problem
 
04:28:30.070 --> 04:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
and would strongly urge the committee
 
04:28:31.189 --> 04:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
not to
 
04:28:33.030 --> 04:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
not to support it
 
04:28:34.229 --> 04:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:38.550 --> 04:28:38.560 align:start position:0%

04:31:13.110 --> 04:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
it would include

i'm lexi ross i'm an attorney with new
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of labor and we
 
04:32:34.149 --> 04:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
understand what the intent of
 
04:32:36.550 --> 04:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
the bill is um we have no position we
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
are confused by it
 
04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
so rsa 275 3
 
04:32:43.429 --> 04:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
does state um
 
04:32:45.429 --> 04:32:45.439 align:start position:0%
it shall be unlawful for any employer as
 
04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
defined by rc274 2754 excuse me to
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
require an employee or applicant for
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
employment to pay the cost of medical
 
04:32:54.630 --> 04:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
examination or the cost of furnishing
 
04:32:56.229 --> 04:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
any records required by the employer as
 
04:32:58.149 --> 04:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
a condition of employment
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
could you get a little closer to the
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
microphone we're having some trouble in
 
04:33:03.230 --> 04:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
the corner yeah so there's
 
04:33:06.789 --> 04:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
rsa2753 does already
 
04:33:09.029 --> 04:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
protect applicants as a condition of
 
04:33:09.039 --> 04:33:10.150 align:start position:0%
protect applicants as a condition of
employment

04:33:10.150 --> 04:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh from having to incur costs there's
 
04:33:16.150 --> 04:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
also rsa 275 57 which is i understand
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to amend but it
 
04:33:20.470 --> 04:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
already broadly addresses this issue
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
although not specific to applicants we
 
04:33:24.629 --> 04:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
do have rsa275 iii
 
04:33:27.189 --> 04:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
there's a labral 80302
 
04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
subsection b that also us
 
04:33:32.390 --> 04:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
specifies um
 
04:33:34.150 --> 04:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
as a specificity excuse me additional
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
detail with respect to these types of
 
04:33:36.000 --> 04:33:36.949 align:start position:0%
detail with respect to these types of
laws

04:33:36.949 --> 04:33:36.959 align:start position:0%
laws
 
04:33:36.959 --> 04:33:38.390 align:start position:0%
laws
um

04:33:38.390 --> 04:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:41.349 --> 04:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
and 275 48 makes it illegal for an
 
04:33:43.510 --> 04:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
employer to mandate an employee to incur
 
04:33:46.230 --> 04:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
a cost to the benefit of the employer so
 
04:33:48.390 --> 04:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
there are statutes already in place to
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
protect employees in these situations
 
04:33:52.551 --> 04:33:52.561 align:start position:0%
that is how the department labor
 
04:33:54.949 --> 04:33:54.959 align:start position:0%
interprets the law currently is to
 
04:33:57.269 --> 04:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
protect employees in this situation and
 
04:33:59.429 --> 04:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
potential employees the applicants
 
04:33:59.439 --> 04:34:00.310 align:start position:0%
potential employees the applicants
um

04:34:00.310 --> 04:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:02.709 --> 04:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
we do have get a number of calls we were
 
04:34:05.189 --> 04:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
flooded with calls during the pandemic
 
04:34:07.189 --> 04:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
with questions about whether or not the
 
04:34:07.199 --> 04:34:08.230 align:start position:0%
with questions about whether or not the
law

04:34:08.230 --> 04:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:34:11.269 --> 04:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
mandates employ employees to uh incur
 
04:34:13.029 --> 04:34:13.039 align:start position:0%
protects employees recurring costs for
 
04:34:15.670 --> 04:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
testing especially covet testing
 
04:34:17.349 --> 04:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
and that was our interpretation at the
 
04:34:18.789 --> 04:34:18.799 align:start position:0%
time as well
 
04:34:20.310 --> 04:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
i believe the special circumstances of
 
04:34:21.990 --> 04:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
the pandemic led to employers becoming
 
04:34:23.830 --> 04:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
confused but our laws did address it
 
04:34:23.840 --> 04:34:24.869 align:start position:0%
confused but our laws did address it
already

04:34:24.869 --> 04:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:34:26.629 --> 04:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
so we are confused that we believe that
 
04:34:27.990 --> 04:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
this bill to be duplicative of the
 
04:34:30.230 --> 04:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
statutes that are already in place
 
04:34:31.990 --> 04:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you for the
 
04:34:33.830 --> 04:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
testimony uh
 
04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
questions i'll start with representative
 
04:34:35.359 --> 04:34:38.390 align:start position:0%
questions i'll start with representative
prout

04:34:38.390 --> 04:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:40.869 --> 04:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
thank you um do you see anything new in
 
04:34:43.349 --> 04:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
this bill uh specifically regarding the
 
04:34:45.590 --> 04:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
payment for travel expenses right to the
 
04:34:47.590 --> 04:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
medical examination or the test or
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
anything else is that already covered or
 
04:34:51.510 --> 04:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
would that be new it's already covered
 
04:34:54.310 --> 04:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
where mileage is to be reimbursed
 
04:34:57.750 --> 04:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
so the employer can so for instance if i
 
04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
were employee i can't say i want to get
 
04:35:01.750 --> 04:35:01.760 align:start position:0%

um
 
04:35:06.551 --> 04:35:06.561 align:start position:0%
the employer can say you know please get
 
04:35:08.310 --> 04:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
your testing at the rite aid down the
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
block to help save on cost um but uh
 
04:35:13.590 --> 04:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
they are to
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
to to to to reimburse for cost of

04:36:40.390 --> 04:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
275.48
 
04:36:42.869 --> 04:36:42.879 align:start position:0%
yes 275.48
 
04:36:44.470 --> 04:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
if you look at it makes it illegal for
 
04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
an employee under i
 
04:36:49.189 --> 04:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
sub section i know it's a long statute
 
04:36:51.910 --> 04:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
that one it is
 
04:36:53.590 --> 04:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
i is the date the recovery of
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
overpayment will begin and end
 
04:37:01.590 --> 04:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
sorry no sorry 275 subsection um so it's
 
04:37:05.269 --> 04:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
275 colon 48 i and then it goes starts
 
04:37:08.310 --> 04:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
off with one and if you go into
 
04:37:09.750 --> 04:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
i read it this morning double check it
 
04:37:11.429 --> 04:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
was in there um i should have brought in
 
04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
so it's 12 for the purpose for any
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
purposes in which the employer employee
 
04:37:23.349 --> 04:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
mutually agree that does not grant
 
04:37:25.830 --> 04:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
financial advantage to the employer
 
04:37:27.670 --> 04:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
so here
 
04:37:30.629 --> 04:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
if you're mandating an employee go get
 
04:37:30.639 --> 04:37:31.670 align:start position:0%
if you're mandating an employee go get
testing

04:37:31.670 --> 04:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
testing
 
04:37:33.109 --> 04:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
it's the financial
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
benefit of the employer not to incur
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
that cost
 
04:37:39.510 --> 04:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
so they can't so even if they both agree
 
04:37:40.470 --> 04:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
to it
 
04:37:42.150 --> 04:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
they're not legally able to do that the
 
04:37:43.830 --> 04:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
employer has to pay for the cost of
 
04:37:46.230 --> 04:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
travel to get that testing
 
04:37:46.240 --> 04:37:47.189 align:start position:0%
travel to get that testing
so

04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:49.269 --> 04:37:49.279 align:start position:0%
you can't force someone to get a test
 
04:37:51.750 --> 04:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
without having to um incur the cost
 
04:37:53.269 --> 04:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
associated with going and getting that
 
04:37:55.830 --> 04:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
testing done
 
04:37:57.670 --> 04:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um so just to be
 
04:38:00.470 --> 04:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
clear um
 
04:38:03.029 --> 04:38:03.039 align:start position:0%
health screening is covered their time
 
04:38:05.029 --> 04:38:05.039 align:start position:0%
there and from is covered if it's during
 
04:38:06.390 --> 04:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
their work hours
 
04:38:08.230 --> 04:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
their mileage is covered unless they're
 
04:38:10.470 --> 04:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
using a company vehicle even if it's not
 
04:38:11.830 --> 04:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
during their work hours they're to be
 
04:38:14.789 --> 04:38:14.799 align:start position:0%
reimbursed including mileage
 
04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
04:38:18.070 --> 04:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
you get all that
 
04:38:18.080 --> 04:38:19.590 align:start position:0%
you get all that
so

04:38:19.590 --> 04:38:19.600 align:start position:0%

and appointed officials we are also
 
04:39:21.910 --> 04:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
confused by the bill um but i will point
 
04:39:24.949 --> 04:39:24.959 align:start position:0%
out that the current language doesn't in
 
04:39:26.551 --> 04:39:26.561 align:start position:0%
the bill does not include any
 
04:39:28.470 --> 04:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
pre-existing relationships that we may
 
04:39:30.551 --> 04:39:30.561 align:start position:0%
have with providers so for example a
 
04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
coveted test at the nursing home you
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
if we're in outbreak we're required to
 
04:39:38.310 --> 04:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:39.990 --> 04:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
so you have to have a test to come in
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
we're offering that test
 
04:39:43.110 --> 04:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
for free
 
04:39:45.110 --> 04:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
at the at the nursing home for you to
 
04:39:46.948 --> 04:39:46.958 align:start position:0%
come in it's all set there's no mileage
 
04:39:48.150 --> 04:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
you're already coming to work you're
 
04:39:50.788 --> 04:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
good to go take your test move on this
 
04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
bill would allow somebody to go
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere else get a test and then
 
04:39:58.390 --> 04:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
require the insur or require the nursing
 
04:39:59.990 --> 04:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
home to pay that bill for something
 
04:40:02.230 --> 04:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
we're already offering for free so based
 
04:40:04.230 --> 04:40:04.240 align:start position:0%
on those reasons we are opposed to the
 
04:40:06.230 --> 04:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
bill and we also believe it's already
 
04:40:08.550 --> 04:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
covered under current statute so i'm
 
04:40:10.230 --> 04:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
04:40:11.590 --> 04:40:11.600 align:start position:0%

1472
 
04:41:31.110 --> 04:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
which would prohibit employers from
 
04:41:33.910 --> 04:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
conducting certain anti-union activities
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
because this bill is short i'll just
 
04:41:38.550 --> 04:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
read it out to the committee
 
04:41:40.708 --> 04:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
anti-union activities prohibited no
 
04:41:42.550 --> 04:41:42.560 align:start position:0%

any action
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
to permanently replace any employee who
 
04:41:47.830 --> 04:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
participates in a strike as defined by
 
04:41:50.310 --> 04:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
section 501
 
04:41:52.070 --> 04:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
parentheses 2 of the labor management
 
04:41:54.550 --> 04:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
relations act not prohibited under state
 
04:41:54.560 --> 04:41:55.590 align:start position:0%
relations act not prohibited under state
law

04:41:55.590 --> 04:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:41:57.510 --> 04:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
b to discriminate against an employee
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
who is working or has unconditionally
 
04:42:01.110 --> 04:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
offered to return to work for the
 
04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
employer because the employee supported
 
04:42:05.190 --> 04:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
or participated in such a strike
 
04:42:07.910 --> 04:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
or c to lock out suspend or otherwise
 
04:42:09.670 --> 04:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
withhold employment from employees in
 
04:42:11.350 --> 04:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
order to influence the position of such
 
04:42:13.510 --> 04:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
employees or representative of such
 
04:42:15.430 --> 04:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
employees in collective bargaining prior
 
04:42:16.868 --> 04:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
to a strike
 
04:42:18.470 --> 04:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill
 
04:42:20.628 --> 04:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
no employer shall engage in anti-union
 
04:42:22.550 --> 04:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
training of any kind including requiring
 
04:42:24.150 --> 04:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
or coercing
 
04:42:25.830 --> 04:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
an employee to view a video that casts
 
04:42:27.990 --> 04:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
unions in a negative light
 
04:42:30.708 --> 04:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
this bill would simply strengthen
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
worker protections and creates an
 
04:42:33.670 --> 04:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
environment where workers truly have the
 
04:42:35.510 --> 04:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
freedom to choose whether they would
 
04:42:37.270 --> 04:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
like to unionize or not
 
04:42:39.270 --> 04:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
currently many workplaces such as target
 
04:42:41.910 --> 04:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
walmart american eagle home depot amazon
 
04:42:43.590 --> 04:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
all require new employees to watch
 
04:42:46.788 --> 04:42:46.798 align:start position:0%
anti-union videos in their training
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
this creates a bias in the workplace
 
04:42:50.708 --> 04:42:50.718 align:start position:0%
against unionizing
 
04:42:52.230 --> 04:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
for example let's take american eagle
 
04:42:53.590 --> 04:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
where i worked
 
04:42:55.190 --> 04:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
it was a primarily staffed by those
 
04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
beloads the age of 24.
 
04:43:01.030 --> 04:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
many of them it was their first job
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
i want you to imagine this a 16 year old
 
04:43:04.390 --> 04:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
it's their first job they've never even
 
04:43:06.150 --> 04:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
heard of a union
 
04:43:07.910 --> 04:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
and the first time that they ever learn
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
about a union is through this training
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
that paints unionization in a negative
 
04:43:12.718 --> 04:43:14.788 align:start position:0%
that paints unionization in a negative
light

04:43:14.788 --> 04:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
light
 
04:43:16.948 --> 04:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
this bias taints any unionization effort
 
04:43:18.868 --> 04:43:18.878 align:start position:0%
that could come about i personally
 
04:43:20.070 --> 04:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
believe the only time that there should
 
04:43:22.390 --> 04:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
be any campaigning one way or another on
 
04:43:25.510 --> 04:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
unionization is during a union election
 
04:43:27.030 --> 04:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would simply level the playing
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
field and remove anti-union bias from
 
04:43:30.310 --> 04:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
the workplace so that workers can make
 
04:43:32.628 --> 04:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
up their minds on unionization without
 
04:43:35.510 --> 04:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
an undue pressure by the employer
 
04:43:36.788 --> 04:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
with that i ask that the committee
 
04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
passed this bill with a not pass
 
04:43:38.000 --> 04:43:40.628 align:start position:0%
passed this bill with a not pass
recommendation

04:43:40.628 --> 04:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
04:43:42.550 --> 04:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
04:43:46.550 --> 04:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions so thank you
 
04:43:51.670 --> 04:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
again for your testimony
 
04:43:53.590 --> 04:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
i have a card
 
04:43:55.110 --> 04:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
again from the new hampshire department
 
04:43:57.350 --> 04:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
of labor lexi rojas
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:03.910 --> 04:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:44:05.270 --> 04:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
so the department of labor understands
 
04:44:06.788 --> 04:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
the bill we take no position on as i
 
04:44:09.510 --> 04:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
stated in the card um we just wanted to
 
04:44:11.110 --> 04:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
make it clear that our reading of the
 
04:44:12.708 --> 04:44:12.718 align:start position:0%
bill is that
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
it does not change our current penalty
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
provisions in that if this were to if an
 
04:44:18.948 --> 04:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
employer were to violate this and
 
04:44:21.110 --> 04:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
someone were to lose employment or
 
04:44:23.590 --> 04:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
not be given a position because of this
 
04:44:23.600 --> 04:44:25.110 align:start position:0%
not be given a position because of this
bill

04:44:25.110 --> 04:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:44:25.120 --> 04:44:25.990 align:start position:0%
bill
the

04:44:25.990 --> 04:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:44:27.990 --> 04:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
per the employer will be given 30 days
 
04:44:30.070 --> 04:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
to correct a 30-day warning
 
04:44:32.150 --> 04:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh and the only recourse we'd have in
 
04:44:33.590 --> 04:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
addition after that if they did not
 
04:44:35.910 --> 04:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
correct it was uh
 
04:44:39.030 --> 04:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
a 2500 fine up to 2500
 
04:44:40.550 --> 04:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to make that
 
04:44:40.560 --> 04:44:43.030 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to make that
clear

04:44:43.030 --> 04:44:43.040 align:start position:0%

uh
 
05:21:20.628 --> 05:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
has as its objective let's say the
 
05:21:22.868 --> 05:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
greatest need of uh
 
05:21:24.628 --> 05:21:24.638 align:start position:0%
addressing the
 
05:21:24.638 --> 05:21:26.230 align:start position:0%
addressing the
um

05:21:26.230 --> 05:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:29.750 --> 05:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
unlikely but um uh possible uh
 
05:21:31.990 --> 05:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances where it's difficult or
 
05:21:34.548 --> 05:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
even impossible for
 
05:21:34.558 --> 05:21:35.830 align:start position:0%
even impossible for
a

05:21:35.830 --> 05:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:21:38.070 --> 05:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
an employee to get to the polls to vote
 
05:21:40.230 --> 05:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
on on voting day
 
05:21:42.070 --> 05:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:21:45.270 --> 05:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
precedents for such a bill as amended i
 
05:21:47.430 --> 05:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
haven't actually found
 
05:21:49.350 --> 05:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
bills that are
 
05:21:50.948 --> 05:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
similar to the
 
05:21:56.788 --> 05:21:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:56.798 --> 05:21:57.670 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

05:21:57.670 --> 05:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:21:57.680 --> 05:21:59.350 align:start position:0%
sorry
um

05:21:59.350 --> 05:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:01.030 --> 05:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
you were going to make some copies of
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
this it was passed around
 
05:22:09.270 --> 05:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:11.110 --> 05:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
so why don't you just give
 
05:22:13.430 --> 05:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
give us a minute to get these out please
 
05:22:13.440 --> 05:22:29.190 align:start position:0%
give us a minute to get these out please
certainly

05:22:29.190 --> 05:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:23:00.150 --> 05:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
as i was saying that
 
05:23:02.470 --> 05:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
the need addressed here is the unlikely
 
05:23:05.110 --> 05:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
but possible situation where uh
 
05:23:07.190 --> 05:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh employees are
 
05:23:09.190 --> 05:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh unable or it's extremely difficult
 
05:23:10.868 --> 05:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
for them to get to the polls on election
 
05:23:10.878 --> 05:23:12.150 align:start position:0%
for them to get to the polls on election
day

05:23:12.150 --> 05:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
day
 
05:23:14.548 --> 05:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
there are as far as i could find no
 
05:23:16.470 --> 05:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
other states that had a bill quite like
 
05:23:18.230 --> 05:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
the one originally presented but there
 
05:23:21.030 --> 05:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
are 29 states that have bills
 
05:23:23.350 --> 05:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
very much like the one
 
05:23:25.830 --> 05:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
presented by this amendment including
 
05:23:29.030 --> 05:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
states such as kansas texas tennessee
 
05:23:32.230 --> 05:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
oklahoma and particularly utah on which
 
05:23:34.788 --> 05:23:34.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is primarily based not
 
05:23:37.590 --> 05:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
entirely but it's very similar
 
05:23:39.670 --> 05:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
one thing this amendment would do would
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
be to correct an error that everyone
 
05:23:43.670 --> 05:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
perceived in the bill when it came up
 
05:23:45.350 --> 05:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
for hearing
 
05:23:45.360 --> 05:23:46.150 align:start position:0%
for hearing
and

05:23:46.150 --> 05:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:49.270 --> 05:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
instead of it indicating that an
 
05:23:51.190 --> 05:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
employee would get at least three hours
 
05:23:51.200 --> 05:23:52.230 align:start position:0%
employee would get at least three hours
off

05:23:52.230 --> 05:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
off
 
05:23:52.240 --> 05:23:53.190 align:start position:0%
off
this

05:23:53.190 --> 05:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:23:55.670 --> 05:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
amended version states that an employee
 
05:23:59.110 --> 05:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
would get up to two hours off
 
05:24:02.788 --> 05:24:02.798 align:start position:0%
in addition it gives the employer
 
05:24:04.868 --> 05:24:04.878 align:start position:0%
the right to get advance notice and
 
05:24:06.948 --> 05:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
select the time off although an an
 
05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
employee would be allowed
 
05:24:10.548 --> 05:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
to ask for two hours at the beginning or
 
05:24:11.590 --> 05:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
the end
 
05:24:11.600 --> 05:24:12.470 align:start position:0%
the end
of

05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:24:14.788 --> 05:24:14.798 align:start position:0%
the shift or as much or as little part
 
05:24:17.430 --> 05:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
of that as they would need
 
05:24:17.440 --> 05:24:18.470 align:start position:0%
of that as they would need
and

05:24:18.470 --> 05:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:21.030 --> 05:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
importantly it excludes all employees
 
05:24:23.590 --> 05:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
that have three consecutive hours
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
not on the job while the polls are open
 
05:24:29.030 --> 05:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
now that provides a variety of
 
05:24:31.430 --> 05:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
protections for employers
 
05:24:33.270 --> 05:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
first of all most employees i'd say
 
05:24:36.548 --> 05:24:36.558 align:start position:0%
probably the vast majority of employees
 
05:24:36.558 --> 05:24:38.788 align:start position:0%
probably the vast majority of employees
would

05:24:38.788 --> 05:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:24:41.350 --> 05:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
have three consecutive hours not on the
 
05:24:44.150 --> 05:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
job when the polls are open so in effect
 
05:24:47.430 --> 05:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
this would apply only to the
 
05:24:47.440 --> 05:24:48.150 align:start position:0%
this would apply only to the
the

05:24:48.150 --> 05:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:24:51.030 --> 05:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
employees who are most at risk of not
 
05:24:54.948 --> 05:24:54.958 align:start position:0%
having time to get to the polls to vote
 
05:24:54.958 --> 05:24:56.628 align:start position:0%
having time to get to the polls to vote
secondly

05:24:56.628 --> 05:24:56.638 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
05:24:58.948 --> 05:24:58.958 align:start position:0%
it would provide protection in the
 
05:25:02.310 --> 05:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
context as was asked at the hearing
 
05:25:04.708 --> 05:25:04.718 align:start position:0%
in in relation to part-time employees
 
05:25:04.718 --> 05:25:05.590 align:start position:0%
in in relation to part-time employees
because

05:25:05.590 --> 05:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:25:07.750 --> 05:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's almost unimaginable that a
 
05:25:10.150 --> 05:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
part-time employee would not have three
 
05:25:12.548 --> 05:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
consecutive hours when polls were open
 
05:25:15.190 --> 05:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
when they were not on the job thirdly it
 
05:25:17.270 --> 05:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
would protect in the context as asked
 
05:25:20.310 --> 05:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
about also at the hearing of
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
employees that might have more than one
 
05:25:24.470 --> 05:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
employer because this
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses
 
05:25:31.190 --> 05:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
a situation where an employee
 
05:25:32.548 --> 05:25:32.558 align:start position:0%
um is
 
05:25:35.270 --> 05:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh has three consecutive hours while the
 
05:25:37.990 --> 05:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
polls are open not on the job and that's
 
05:25:40.070 --> 05:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
important language because if you have
 
05:25:42.788 --> 05:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
two jobs each one is protected by that
 
05:25:45.590 --> 05:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
the job is the job in question and so no
 
05:25:47.590 --> 05:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
employer would be asked to bear the
 
05:25:49.750 --> 05:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
burden of an employee having
 
05:25:52.070 --> 05:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
multiple jobs that precluded him from
 
05:25:55.030 --> 05:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
getting to the polls
 
05:25:59.990 --> 05:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
the um the greatest value of this um
 
05:26:02.868 --> 05:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
amendment as i see it is that
 
05:26:05.590 --> 05:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
it allows as i said that allows those
 
05:26:07.350 --> 05:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
who would legitimately struggle to get
 
05:26:08.948 --> 05:26:08.958 align:start position:0%
to the polls to have a little bit of
 
05:26:12.470 --> 05:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that and it would also
 
05:26:12.480 --> 05:26:14.070 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that and it would also
um

05:26:14.070 --> 05:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:16.390 --> 05:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
indicate the value and importance of
 
05:26:19.510 --> 05:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
voting in uh democracy by conveying that
 
05:26:19.520 --> 05:26:20.628 align:start position:0%
voting in uh democracy by conveying that
message

05:26:20.628 --> 05:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
message
 
05:26:22.548 --> 05:26:22.558 align:start position:0%
and i might say to some of my friends
 
05:26:27.590 --> 05:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
here that it would also potentially act
 
05:26:29.910 --> 05:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
contrarily to the idea that we need some
 
05:26:32.708 --> 05:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
kind of national
 
05:26:34.708 --> 05:26:34.718 align:start position:0%
day off for
 
05:26:36.310 --> 05:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
election days
 
05:26:38.708 --> 05:26:38.718 align:start position:0%
by virtue of providing a sensible
 
05:26:41.030 --> 05:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
alternative to that
 
05:26:43.750 --> 05:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
to work in the circumstances where it is
 
05:26:46.548 --> 05:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
most needed and so finally i would ask
 
05:26:49.350 --> 05:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
if this amendment could be allowed to
 
05:26:52.708 --> 05:26:52.718 align:start position:0%
proceed i think we would find ourselves
 
05:26:55.430 --> 05:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
with a more thoughtful approach a more
 
05:26:57.030 --> 05:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate approach and one more
 
05:26:59.110 --> 05:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
consistent with the majority of states
 
05:27:01.830 --> 05:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
in this country to allow consideration
 
05:27:04.628 --> 05:27:04.638 align:start position:0%
of this up to two hour rate
 
05:27:07.510 --> 05:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
under certain circumstances to have uh
 
05:27:09.670 --> 05:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
time to get to the polls thank you mr
 
05:27:10.948 --> 05:27:10.958 align:start position:0%
chairman all right thank you any
 
05:27:12.868 --> 05:27:12.878 align:start position:0%
additional any comments anyone else like
 
05:27:17.590 --> 05:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:20.230 --> 05:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just a question um
 
05:27:22.070 --> 05:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
for the three or more consecutive hours
 
05:27:23.350 --> 05:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
between the time
 
05:27:25.350 --> 05:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
polls open and close
 
05:27:27.110 --> 05:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so this would preclude people that
 
05:27:28.948 --> 05:27:28.958 align:start position:0%
worked nine to five if the polls were
 
05:27:30.708 --> 05:27:30.718 align:start position:0%
open seven to seven there would be they
 
05:27:32.230 --> 05:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
would have to have an extra two hours
 
05:27:34.548 --> 05:27:34.558 align:start position:0%
off or am i mistaken
 
05:27:38.070 --> 05:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
up to two hours
 
05:27:40.548 --> 05:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
up oh even though the polls are open two
 
05:27:43.670 --> 05:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
hours before and two hours after their
 
05:27:45.590 --> 05:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
job service that's the way it's written
 
05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
there are some other states since you
 
05:27:49.190 --> 05:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
asked and i appreciate the question
 
05:27:51.430 --> 05:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
that do address it that way two hours on
 
05:27:52.470 --> 05:27:52.480 align:start position:0%
either side
 
05:27:54.310 --> 05:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
that's an alternative to three uh
 
05:27:54.320 --> 05:27:55.510 align:start position:0%
that's an alternative to three uh
consecutive

05:27:55.510 --> 05:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
consecutive
 
05:27:57.590 --> 05:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
um i i would
 
05:27:59.510 --> 05:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
so that's that that would be an option
 
05:28:01.430 --> 05:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
but that's not what's here
 
05:28:03.110 --> 05:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:28:05.030 --> 05:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
i have a question so there's still the
 
05:28:06.708 --> 05:28:06.718 align:start position:0%
concept here from the last sentence is
 
05:28:07.750 --> 05:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
that still
 
05:28:07.760 --> 05:28:08.788 align:start position:0%
that still
um

05:28:08.788 --> 05:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:08.798 --> 05:28:09.910 align:start position:0%
um
employer

05:28:09.910 --> 05:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
employer
 
05:28:14.230 --> 05:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
pays the hours for regardless correct
 
05:28:14.240 --> 05:28:15.350 align:start position:0%
pays the hours for regardless correct
the

05:28:15.350 --> 05:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:28:17.430 --> 05:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
large majority of states that have this
 
05:28:18.470 --> 05:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
law or
 
05:28:20.868 --> 05:28:20.878 align:start position:0%
an equivalent of it have that not all of
 
05:28:22.310 --> 05:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
them although
 
05:28:22.320 --> 05:28:24.230 align:start position:0%
them although
the

05:28:24.230 --> 05:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:28:26.230 --> 05:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
law review article i looked at it as
 
05:28:28.070 --> 05:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
suggested it was implied in all of them
 
05:28:45.270 --> 05:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:48.230 --> 05:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um just a math
 
05:28:48.240 --> 05:28:49.190 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um just a math
question

05:28:49.190 --> 05:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:28:51.510 --> 05:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
um so if
 
05:28:54.548 --> 05:28:54.558 align:start position:0%
if it's three consecutive hours
 
05:28:56.470 --> 05:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
and in the previous
 
05:28:59.030 --> 05:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
situation there was two hours before and
 
05:29:00.868 --> 05:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
two hours after
 
05:29:02.628 --> 05:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
would that mean the employee would
 
05:29:04.470 --> 05:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
employer would only have to pay
 
05:29:06.470 --> 05:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
for one hour
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
because that would be
 
05:29:11.990 --> 05:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's not the way i i understand this
 
05:29:16.788 --> 05:29:16.798 align:start position:0%
or intended to draft the the idea is
 
05:29:19.430 --> 05:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
that the employee is allowed up to two
 
05:29:19.440 --> 05:29:21.030 align:start position:0%
that the employee is allowed up to two
hours

05:29:21.030 --> 05:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
hours
 
05:29:21.040 --> 05:29:21.990 align:start position:0%
hours
that

05:29:21.990 --> 05:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:29:23.670 --> 05:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
signifies that
 
05:29:26.310 --> 05:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
they they would take what they needed
 
05:29:28.470 --> 05:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
um that might be
 
05:29:30.788 --> 05:29:30.798 align:start position:0%
um that might be 15 minutes that might
 
05:29:32.628 --> 05:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
be an hour that might be two hours it's
 
05:29:39.590 --> 05:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:42.548 --> 05:29:42.558 align:start position:0%
representative proud
 
05:29:42.558 --> 05:29:43.510 align:start position:0%
representative proud
um

05:29:43.510 --> 05:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:45.510 --> 05:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
following up on that how would they
 
05:29:46.788 --> 05:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
how would what they need to be
 
05:29:48.548 --> 05:29:48.558 align:start position:0%
calculated because you know it says that
 
05:29:50.310 --> 05:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
they can be allowed to take it at the
 
05:29:51.990 --> 05:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
end of the workday if they're concerned
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
about a long line and want to have the
 
05:29:57.270 --> 05:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
full two hours just in case
 
05:29:59.430 --> 05:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
would that the employer be required to
 
05:30:01.910 --> 05:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh to grant that and out of the concern
 
05:30:03.190 --> 05:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
for the long line
 
05:30:06.470 --> 05:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
if the employee is not exempt by virtue
 
05:30:08.470 --> 05:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
of having had three other hours
 
05:30:09.990 --> 05:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
available then the answer your question
 
05:30:11.510 --> 05:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
is yes
 
05:30:11.520 --> 05:30:13.750 align:start position:0%
is yes
the

05:30:13.750 --> 05:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:30:15.350 --> 05:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
again as
 
05:30:17.070 --> 05:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
this is partly
 
05:30:21.270 --> 05:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
a matter of employees working with
 
05:30:23.670 --> 05:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
employers there are plenty of employers
 
05:30:25.830 --> 05:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
that do this voluntarily obviously this
 
05:30:25.840 --> 05:30:27.510 align:start position:0%
that do this voluntarily obviously this
wouldn't

05:30:27.510 --> 05:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
05:30:29.270 --> 05:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
affect those that would want to do
 
05:30:31.030 --> 05:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
things voluntarily would only deal with
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
the ones where there might be a problem
 
05:30:34.868 --> 05:30:34.878 align:start position:0%
and the idea at the end of the day for
 
05:30:37.270 --> 05:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
example in a place if there is any and
 
05:30:38.708 --> 05:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with it but if there
 
05:30:41.030 --> 05:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
were that one was confronting a long
 
05:30:42.548 --> 05:30:42.558 align:start position:0%
line that would be actually a good
 
05:30:47.750 --> 05:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
example of a need for time off uh in as
 
05:30:50.548 --> 05:30:50.558 align:start position:0%
convenient a way as possible
 
05:30:52.310 --> 05:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
to to vote
 
05:30:54.470 --> 05:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
so but to answer your question yes
 
05:30:57.350 --> 05:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
um but it also would depend on
 
05:30:58.868 --> 05:30:58.878 align:start position:0%
discussions between the employee and the
 
05:30:58.878 --> 05:31:00.708 align:start position:0%
discussions between the employee and the
employer

05:31:00.708 --> 05:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
employer
 
05:31:03.510 --> 05:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions president cahill
 
05:31:05.830 --> 05:31:05.840 align:start position:0%

in my town and i'm not sure this is
 
05:31:11.990 --> 05:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
unique but in my town the moderator if
 
05:31:14.310 --> 05:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
there's anyone waiting in line
 
05:31:16.628 --> 05:31:16.638 align:start position:0%
everyone waiting in line gets to vote we
 
05:31:18.230 --> 05:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
don't close the door
 
05:31:19.910 --> 05:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
at the time which is everybody who's in
 
05:31:19.920 --> 05:31:21.030 align:start position:0%

member
 
05:31:28.788 --> 05:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
has put into this amendment it's
 
05:31:30.390 --> 05:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
something that many employers do as he
 
05:31:33.110 --> 05:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
said voluntarily uh but he's done a lot

05:31:41.110 --> 05:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative mandeville
 
05:31:43.270 --> 05:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um i have a problem while
 
05:31:44.230 --> 05:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
you did a great job putting this
 
05:31:46.230 --> 05:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
together i appreciate it especially as a
 
05:31:47.830 --> 05:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
first-time representative in the first
 
05:31:50.948 --> 05:31:50.958 align:start position:0%
couple weeks here so kudos to you
 
05:31:53.110 --> 05:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
this can't get over um
 
05:31:55.270 --> 05:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
asking employers to pay with absentee
 
05:31:57.270 --> 05:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
ballots and other things available
 
05:31:59.270 --> 05:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
um we could be very careful in here
 
05:32:01.030 --> 05:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
about trying to put too many mandates on
 
05:32:03.350 --> 05:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
employers so i can't support you but
 
05:32:05.590 --> 05:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh really for your efforts so
 
05:32:06.788 --> 05:32:06.798 align:start position:0%
unless there's any other questions i'd
 
05:32:08.070 --> 05:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
like the clerk to call the role the
 
05:32:10.788 --> 05:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is on to pass
 
05:32:10.798 --> 05:32:13.510 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is on to pass
sullivan

05:32:13.510 --> 05:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:16.230 --> 05:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:18.470 --> 05:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
i guess a couple things um
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
first of all we don't have a uh no
 
05:32:23.350 --> 05:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
excuse um absentee ballots so
 
05:32:24.788 --> 05:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
some people who
 
05:32:26.470 --> 05:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
maybe were surprised by a schedule
 
05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
change or something like that wouldn't
 
05:32:29.910 --> 05:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to get an absentee
 
05:32:29.920 --> 05:32:30.788 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to get an absentee
ballot

05:32:30.788 --> 05:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
05:32:34.548 --> 05:32:34.558 align:start position:0%
um and uh i also believe that this is a
 
05:32:36.230 --> 05:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
dramatic improvement over the original
 
05:32:38.310 --> 05:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
bill and i guess i would ask my
 
05:32:40.948 --> 05:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
colleagues to support the the amendment
 
05:32:40.958 --> 05:32:42.070 align:start position:0%
colleagues to support the the amendment
um

05:32:42.070 --> 05:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:45.510 --> 05:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
because it's simply a piece of good work
 
05:32:45.520 --> 05:32:46.708 align:start position:0%
because it's simply a piece of good work
and

05:32:46.708 --> 05:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:32:50.310 --> 05:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
i i also commend the representative for
 
05:32:54.070 --> 05:32:54.080 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chair and uh just like the
 
05:33:00.788 --> 05:33:00.798 align:start position:0%
chair i have the problem with the uh
 
05:33:03.350 --> 05:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
with the mandate on employers if uh if a
 
05:33:06.310 --> 05:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
small business had 25 employees and and
 
05:33:07.510 --> 05:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
a small
 
05:33:10.230 --> 05:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
hourly rate of you know hourly rate plus
 
05:33:13.350 --> 05:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
plus the benefits of say 20 an hour it
 
05:33:14.788 --> 05:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
cost that small business a thousand
 
05:33:18.708 --> 05:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
dollars that day i can't vote for that
 
05:33:18.718 --> 05:33:23.510 align:start position:0%
dollars that day i can't vote for that
thanks

05:33:23.510 --> 05:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:33:25.910 --> 05:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is ought to pass to
 
05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh mr clerk would you
 
05:33:30.070 --> 05:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
please call the roll
 
05:33:32.548 --> 05:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
starting with representative seaworth
 
05:33:34.230 --> 05:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry we're voting on the
 
05:33:34.240 --> 05:33:35.270 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry we're voting on the
amendment

05:33:35.270 --> 05:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:42.310 --> 05:33:42.320 align:start position:0%

05:33:44.070 --> 05:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan you called point
 
05:33:45.270 --> 05:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
of order and then i heard something else
 
05:33:48.150 --> 05:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
over there yeah i i believe the
 
05:33:50.150 --> 05:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
the method that we usually follow is to
 
05:33:53.110 --> 05:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment itself and then
 
05:33:55.270 --> 05:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
um a motion to be made ought to pass or
 
05:33:56.548 --> 05:33:56.558 align:start position:0%
something like that but basically the
 
05:33:58.868 --> 05:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
amendment is approved first or not
 
05:34:01.030 --> 05:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
um and then we either go forward with
 
05:34:03.190 --> 05:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
the bill as it originally was structured
 
05:34:05.270 --> 05:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
or as it was amended
 
05:34:06.548 --> 05:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
correct that's what i meant but i didn't
 
05:34:08.390 --> 05:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
say it
 
05:34:10.788 --> 05:34:10.798 align:start position:0%

05:38:55.590 --> 05:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
that's not solvent
 
05:39:10.628 --> 05:39:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:13.110 --> 05:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
yeah just uh usually what happens is the
 
05:39:15.590 --> 05:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
blur will be written um by uh the
 
05:39:18.310 --> 05:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
majority vote and the minority vote um
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
which you know
 
05:39:21.590 --> 05:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
you haven't seen a house calendar yet
 
05:39:54.150 --> 05:39:54.160 align:start position:0%

05:40:10.628 --> 05:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
requiring prevailing wage
 
05:40:13.590 --> 05:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
on state funded public works project
 
05:40:15.270 --> 05:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh you can recognize
 
05:40:17.990 --> 05:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative warden for a motion
 
05:40:20.708 --> 05:40:20.718 align:start position:0%
i move and expedient to legislate
 
05:40:23.110 --> 05:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
is there a second second second by
 
05:40:23.120 --> 05:40:24.548 align:start position:0%
is there a second second second by
abalani

05:40:24.548 --> 05:40:24.558 align:start position:0%
abalani
 
05:40:26.310 --> 05:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
you may speak to your motion thank you
 
05:40:28.868 --> 05:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i think the prevailing wage
 
05:40:30.230 --> 05:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
thing is just going to lead to higher
 
05:40:31.670 --> 05:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
prices we're already suffering through
 
05:40:33.910 --> 05:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
higher prices and supply chains
 
05:40:36.548 --> 05:40:36.558 align:start position:0%
shortages and uh it puts a further
 
05:40:38.150 --> 05:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
hindrance on
 
05:40:39.910 --> 05:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
the movement of
 
05:40:41.670 --> 05:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
capital and labor
 
05:40:41.680 --> 05:40:43.670 align:start position:0%
capital and labor
and

05:40:43.670 --> 05:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:40:45.670 --> 05:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
only only would lead to higher taxes on
 
05:40:47.910 --> 05:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents so
 
05:40:50.628 --> 05:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
it's inappropriate for us to
 
05:40:53.430 --> 05:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
pass this legislation thank you
 
05:40:55.430 --> 05:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else like to speak on
 
05:40:55.440 --> 05:40:57.510 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else like to speak on
this

05:40:57.510 --> 05:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:40:59.190 --> 05:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:40:59.200 --> 05:41:00.868 align:start position:0%
the uh
um

05:41:00.868 --> 05:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:02.788 --> 05:41:02.798 align:start position:0%
one of the issues i had was when
 
05:41:05.270 --> 05:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
when gary abbott spoke in the hard time
 
05:41:07.990 --> 05:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
how how hard it take how
 
05:41:09.750 --> 05:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
long it takes and how hard it is to get
 
05:41:13.430 --> 05:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
actually a prevailing wage established
 
05:41:15.750 --> 05:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
so few jobs you have to direct
 
05:41:17.110 --> 05:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
the government sends out a request for
 
05:41:18.470 --> 05:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
information the people have to send it
 
05:41:19.750 --> 05:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
back and there's so few projects they
 
05:41:21.510 --> 05:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't send the information back and the
 
05:41:23.910 --> 05:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
wages can be it could be one project in
 
05:41:26.150 --> 05:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
cowas county which would have a
 
05:41:27.990 --> 05:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
on one project others say that the jail
 
05:41:30.390 --> 05:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
they built for instance and that would
 
05:41:31.590 --> 05:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:41:33.750 --> 05:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
create that prevailing wage
 
05:41:35.190 --> 05:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
in that county
 
05:41:36.470 --> 05:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
which could be
 
05:41:39.590 --> 05:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
not indicative of what's going on there
 
05:41:39.600 --> 05:41:42.470 align:start position:0%
not indicative of what's going on there
sullivan

05:41:42.470 --> 05:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:43.750 --> 05:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to say i'm going to be
 
05:41:45.350 --> 05:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
supporting this because frankly i
 
05:41:47.830 --> 05:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
support higher wages for workers and
 
05:41:49.670 --> 05:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
that's what this would accomplish i
 
05:41:51.110 --> 05:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's some problems
 
05:41:54.150 --> 05:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
with it but just the same
 
05:41:56.150 --> 05:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
higher wages for workers is is good for
 
05:42:00.470 --> 05:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:02.628 --> 05:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman one of the
 
05:42:04.948 --> 05:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
concerns i have is even from the
 
05:42:07.990 --> 05:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint of a prevailing wage bill the
 
05:42:09.430 --> 05:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
comments from
 
05:42:10.788 --> 05:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
gary abbott
 
05:42:13.750 --> 05:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
pointed out that there are a number of
 
05:42:15.270 --> 05:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
ways that
 
05:42:17.910 --> 05:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
prevailing wages are calculated this
 
05:42:21.670 --> 05:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
bill goes back to a pre-1985
 
05:42:21.680 --> 05:42:22.868 align:start position:0%
bill goes back to a pre-1985
language

05:42:22.868 --> 05:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:42:22.878 --> 05:42:23.990 align:start position:0%
language
that

05:42:23.990 --> 05:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
at least the testimony
 
05:42:28.390 --> 05:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
told us is probably not appropriate to
 
05:42:33.030 --> 05:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:35.110 --> 05:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
whatever the feeling on prevailing wage
 
05:42:37.430 --> 05:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
bills in general i think
 
05:42:40.230 --> 05:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
this bill language was not properly
 
05:42:40.240 --> 05:42:41.270 align:start position:0%
this bill language was not properly
considered

05:42:41.270 --> 05:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
considered
 
05:42:49.110 --> 05:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:51.430 --> 05:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
seeing no additional uh
 
05:42:53.670 --> 05:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh comments thank you for you guys i
 
05:42:55.830 --> 05:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
guess you got the message
 
05:42:58.868 --> 05:42:58.878 align:start position:0%
um seeing no further

the cacr was a
constitutional

05:45:29.190 --> 05:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
05:45:31.110 --> 05:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that would provide workers
 
05:45:33.510 --> 05:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
having a right to join a union
 
05:45:35.030 --> 05:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'm unaware of
 
05:45:37.830 --> 05:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
any law rsa regulation or anything in
 
05:45:39.830 --> 05:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
our state that currently prevents an

individual from joining a union
 
05:45:42.480 --> 05:45:43.270 align:start position:0%
individual from joining a union
so

05:45:43.270 --> 05:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:45:44.788 --> 05:45:44.798 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for an expedient to
 
05:45:44.798 --> 05:45:53.990 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for an expedient to
legislate

05:45:53.990 --> 05:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:57.190 --> 05:45:57.200 align:start position:0%

05:47:25.270 --> 05:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
of seaworth
 
05:47:27.190 --> 05:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i am very
 
05:47:28.868 --> 05:47:28.878 align:start position:0%
concerned about the language of this
 
05:47:31.510 --> 05:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
bill it's awfully vague
 
05:47:34.310 --> 05:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
um about a right to join the union now
 
05:47:36.310 --> 05:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
i've heard this over my many years on
 
05:47:37.670 --> 05:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:47:39.670 --> 05:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
people have testified that
 
05:47:41.910 --> 05:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
people have a constitutional right to be
 
05:47:44.390 --> 05:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
a member of the union
 
05:47:46.548 --> 05:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
and i have to agree it's protected by
 
05:47:48.310 --> 05:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
freedom of association freedom of
 
05:47:48.320 --> 05:47:50.310 align:start position:0%
freedom of association freedom of
assembly

05:47:50.310 --> 05:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
assembly
 
05:47:52.548 --> 05:47:52.558 align:start position:0%
but what does this language mean it
 
05:47:54.708 --> 05:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't say you have a right to be
 
05:47:58.628 --> 05:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
represented in the workplace by a union
 
05:48:02.470 --> 05:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
it merely guarantees membership
 
05:48:04.868 --> 05:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
does that guarantee me membership if i
 
05:48:07.430 --> 05:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
decide i want a screen actors guild card
 
05:48:08.708 --> 05:48:08.718 align:start position:0%
can i say
 
05:48:10.548 --> 05:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
constitutional right got to give it to
 
05:48:12.070 --> 05:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
me or
 
05:48:14.470 --> 05:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
does the union get some say in it
 
05:48:17.670 --> 05:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:19.830 --> 05:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
and and i think even during the
 
05:48:19.840 --> 05:48:21.190 align:start position:0%
and and i think even during the
testimony

05:48:21.190 --> 05:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:48:22.788 --> 05:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
05:48:25.670 --> 05:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
at some point talked about all the great
 
05:48:28.708 --> 05:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
things this would do and in in other
 
05:48:30.948 --> 05:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
sentences he described how this wouldn't
 
05:48:32.708 --> 05:48:32.718 align:start position:0%
change certain things
 
05:48:34.708 --> 05:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
i have a really hard time
 
05:48:37.030 --> 05:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh with an amendment that
 
05:48:40.070 --> 05:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
i just really don't understand what it's
 
05:48:42.470 --> 05:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish and so for that
 
05:48:47.350 --> 05:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:50.948 --> 05:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:56.230 --> 05:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:57.990 --> 05:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
05:49:01.030 --> 05:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
my position on this will be negative
 
05:49:04.868 --> 05:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
um from the viewpoint of
 
05:49:06.788 --> 05:49:06.798 align:start position:0%
the constitution
 
05:49:08.628 --> 05:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
as it was written
 
05:49:11.110 --> 05:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
both federal and state
 
05:49:17.190 --> 05:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
was amended to be le to be amended at um
 
05:49:20.868 --> 05:49:20.878 align:start position:0%
not just any whim but on a serious
 
05:49:23.990 --> 05:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
and well-considered situation
 
05:49:26.788 --> 05:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
and so i have a problem with anything
 
05:49:29.910 --> 05:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
where it says well we can mend it
 
05:49:31.830 --> 05:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
when we like
 
05:49:33.750 --> 05:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand
 
05:49:36.948 --> 05:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
i'm going to specify in my amendment
 
05:49:39.670 --> 05:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
that it's forever and unamendable
 
05:49:42.948 --> 05:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
so i'll be voting no
 
05:49:46.390 --> 05:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:48.708 --> 05:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
seeing no other hands we have a motion
 
05:49:50.628 --> 05:49:50.638 align:start position:0%

which really
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
basically just
 
06:00:07.830 --> 06:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you do we have a second
 
06:00:10.548 --> 06:00:10.558 align:start position:0%
thank you second by mandeville
 
06:00:11.750 --> 06:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
you're recognized to speak for your
 
06:00:14.708 --> 06:00:14.718 align:start position:0%
motion thank you again mr chair uh the
 
06:00:17.030 --> 06:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
language that's added to the
 
06:00:18.470 --> 06:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
with this amendment
 
06:00:20.788 --> 06:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
covers a contractor
 
06:00:23.030 --> 06:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh employed this was aimed at helping uh
 
06:00:25.270 --> 06:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
the next terror which has contracted
 
06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
providing security uh which was not
 
06:00:30.470 --> 06:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
covered in the uh language from congress
 
06:00:32.788 --> 06:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
so this this adds to that
 
06:00:35.270 --> 06:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh mr berkey had uh not heard back from
 
06:00:36.788 --> 06:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
his lawyers yet
 
06:00:39.190 --> 06:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
but again the the idea here is that when
 
06:00:41.110 --> 06:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
you're applying for a job
 
06:00:43.110 --> 06:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
you're not applying for a loan you're
 
06:00:44.708 --> 06:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
applying for a job so that you can
 
06:00:47.350 --> 06:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
provide do the job earn the money
 
06:00:49.670 --> 06:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
pay whatever current debts you have pay
 
06:00:51.590 --> 06:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
any old debts you have
 
06:00:53.590 --> 06:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
and just go about your business
 
06:00:57.110 --> 06:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
so the the idea here is banning the uh
 
06:00:59.030 --> 06:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
credit history unless it's absolutely
 
06:01:01.590 --> 06:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
needed that's the idea to allow people
 
06:01:04.470 --> 06:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
to apply for a job be considerate for a
 
06:01:04.480 --> 06:01:05.270 align:start position:0%
to apply for a job be considerate for a
job

06:01:25.510 --> 06:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:28.470 --> 06:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
i respect the fact that you brought
 
06:01:30.628 --> 06:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
this bill a bill has come in front of us
 
06:01:32.628 --> 06:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
pretty much every other year for the
 
06:01:34.868 --> 06:01:34.878 align:start position:0%
last 10 or 12 years
 
06:01:34.878 --> 06:01:36.708 align:start position:0%
last 10 or 12 years
um

06:01:36.708 --> 06:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:38.390 --> 06:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
it is
 
06:01:41.110 --> 06:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
my opinion and the opinion that has been
 
06:01:43.750 --> 06:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
shared by many people here in this in
 
06:01:46.230 --> 06:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
06:01:48.070 --> 06:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
that by the time you take out all the
 
06:01:48.080 --> 06:01:49.430 align:start position:0%
that by the time you take out all the
people

06:01:49.430 --> 06:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:01:49.440 --> 06:01:50.310 align:start position:0%
people
that

06:01:50.310 --> 06:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:01:50.320 --> 06:01:52.230 align:start position:0%
that
are

06:01:52.230 --> 06:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:01:52.240 --> 06:01:54.150 align:start position:0%
are
excluded

06:01:54.150 --> 06:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
excluded
 
06:01:55.590 --> 06:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
there's very few people that are
 
06:01:57.430 --> 06:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
included and we
 
06:01:59.110 --> 06:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
someone probably wouldn't
 
06:01:59.120 --> 06:02:01.670 align:start position:0%
someone probably wouldn't
request

06:02:01.670 --> 06:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
request
 
06:02:03.750 --> 06:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh the person's the prospective
 
06:02:03.760 --> 06:02:05.030 align:start position:0%
uh the person's the prospective
employee's

06:02:05.030 --> 06:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
employee's
 
06:02:07.670 --> 06:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
permission to request a credit check
 
06:02:07.680 --> 06:02:10.070 align:start position:0%
permission to request a credit check
um

06:02:10.070 --> 06:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:11.830 --> 06:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
i just don't see it it's worth their
 
06:02:13.350 --> 06:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
their their costs associated with it
 
06:02:16.868 --> 06:02:16.878 align:start position:0%
however someone who's responsible for
 
06:02:18.628 --> 06:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
closing up a jewelry store at night or
 
06:02:21.030 --> 06:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh credit card payments or
 
06:02:22.230 --> 06:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with anything to do with
 
06:02:25.750 --> 06:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
finances would be so i i don't know
 
06:02:27.270 --> 06:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know as i was
 
06:02:29.190 --> 06:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
talking to representative seaworth at
 
06:02:29.200 --> 06:02:31.510 align:start position:0%
talking to representative seaworth at
lunch

06:02:31.510 --> 06:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:34.548 --> 06:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
while we try to make everything perfect
 
06:02:36.868 --> 06:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
legislation is not perfect and it can't
 
06:02:39.350 --> 06:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
hit everything for every situation that
 
06:02:40.948 --> 06:02:40.958 align:start position:0%
could ever happen
 
06:02:43.830 --> 06:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
and while not passing this may result in
 
06:02:46.310 --> 06:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
one person not you know passing or
 
06:02:48.150 --> 06:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
getting a job and that's that's bad i'm
 
06:02:50.830 --> 06:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
sorry that that occurs
 
06:02:54.150 --> 06:02:54.160 align:start position:0%
um not allowing a a business to do
 
06:02:56.310 --> 06:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
something that they feel is important uh
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:03.270 --> 06:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
can't agree with so while i appreciate
 
06:03:04.868 --> 06:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
the attempts
 
06:03:07.430 --> 06:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
and the amendment um
 
06:03:09.270 --> 06:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i can't support it um
 
06:03:10.390 --> 06:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan and
 
06:03:13.350 --> 06:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:15.350 --> 06:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
i guess i would just like to remind all
 
06:03:17.430 --> 06:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
of us that were voting on the amendment
 
06:03:19.510 --> 06:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i believe the amendment makes an
 
06:03:21.910 --> 06:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
improvement that um mr berkey
 
06:03:23.830 --> 06:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
specifically asked for
 
06:03:25.270 --> 06:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
and however you feel about the
 
06:03:28.230 --> 06:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
underlying bill um i think the amendment
 
06:03:30.708 --> 06:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
uh takes care of a problem and uh i
 
06:03:32.470 --> 06:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
think it's it would be good for the
 
06:03:34.470 --> 06:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
record to show that we attended to the
 
06:03:36.150 --> 06:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
issues that were brought before us thank
 
06:03:36.160 --> 06:03:38.708 align:start position:0%
issues that were brought before us thank
you

06:03:38.708 --> 06:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:38.718 --> 06:03:39.670 align:start position:0%
 
cahill

06:03:39.670 --> 06:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
cahill
 
06:03:41.670 --> 06:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i would just like to
 
06:03:44.788 --> 06:03:44.798 align:start position:0%
address i understand your concern
 
06:03:47.030 --> 06:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
but a person who owes money doesn't
 
06:03:48.788 --> 06:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean the person who will
 
06:03:50.548 --> 06:03:50.558 align:start position:0%
steal money
 
06:03:53.110 --> 06:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
so we're sort of a i think there's a
 
06:03:55.350 --> 06:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
fourth amendment here so you're you're
 
06:03:57.270 --> 06:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
presuming that someone who's behind on
 
06:03:59.590 --> 06:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
their bills right reach into the drawer
 
06:03:59.600 --> 06:04:00.708 align:start position:0%
their bills right reach into the drawer
and

06:04:00.708 --> 06:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:04:02.310 --> 06:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
take something out or do something like
 
06:04:04.948 --> 06:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:06.548 --> 06:04:06.558 align:start position:0%
having bad credit is not a criminal
 
06:04:06.558 --> 06:04:07.590 align:start position:0%
having bad credit is not a criminal
offense

06:04:07.590 --> 06:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
offense
 
06:04:12.788 --> 06:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:15.270 --> 06:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
06:04:17.510 --> 06:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
regarding this is we're first voting on
 
06:04:19.030 --> 06:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment and
 
06:04:21.510 --> 06:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
i do have some discomfort uh with the
 
06:04:23.190 --> 06:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
language i do
 
06:04:25.830 --> 06:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
understand in some ways it's better
 
06:04:30.150 --> 06:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
um it also changes the line on 19 about
 
06:04:32.548 --> 06:04:32.558 align:start position:0%
the bona fide purpose and add some
 
06:04:34.390 --> 06:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
restrictive language
 
06:04:37.910 --> 06:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
and as you were saying mr chairman
 
06:04:40.150 --> 06:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of exceptions to this and
 
06:04:41.990 --> 06:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
and the original language sort of
 
06:04:44.708 --> 06:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
granted those of exceptions in one way
 
06:04:47.590 --> 06:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
and this one reigns it in a lot
 
06:04:49.350 --> 06:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
in a way that i'm not sure i fully
 
06:04:53.350 --> 06:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
understand so i for one cannot support
 
06:05:05.350 --> 06:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:07.510 --> 06:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
i have to respond
 
06:05:09.110 --> 06:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative cahill i'm not presuming
 
06:05:09.120 --> 06:05:10.830 align:start position:0%
representative cahill i'm not presuming
anything

06:05:10.830 --> 06:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
anything
 
06:05:13.750 --> 06:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
um i don't perform background checks on
 
06:05:16.548 --> 06:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
my employees that's just my choice
 
06:05:16.558 --> 06:05:18.548 align:start position:0%
my employees that's just my choice
um

06:05:18.548 --> 06:05:18.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:23.990 --> 06:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's up to the employer
 
06:05:25.590 --> 06:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm not making any dispersion that
 
06:05:27.270 --> 06:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
someone has a bad credit
 
06:05:31.110 --> 06:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
and that they would be uh apt to steal
 
06:05:35.510 --> 06:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:38.150 --> 06:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh oh yes go ahead yeah i
 
06:05:39.910 --> 06:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify that i i didn't
 
06:05:42.070 --> 06:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
suggest that you yourself were doing but
 
06:05:44.390 --> 06:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
the employer may perceive that this
 
06:05:47.270 --> 06:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
person is unreliable and
 
06:05:50.230 --> 06:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
could could uh embezzle or whatever
 
06:05:55.510 --> 06:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:57.270 --> 06:05:57.280 align:start position:0%

mr chairman uh you've covered a lot of
 
06:07:25.360 --> 06:07:26.868 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh you've covered a lot of
it

06:07:26.868 --> 06:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:07:29.510 --> 06:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
like the chairman i've seen this bill a
 
06:07:30.868 --> 06:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
number of times
 
06:07:33.670 --> 06:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
and quite honestly i'm sympathetic i
 
06:07:36.310 --> 06:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases employers
 
06:07:38.868 --> 06:07:38.878 align:start position:0%
are not well served by considering the
 
06:07:41.510 --> 06:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
credit history of their employees
 
06:07:43.430 --> 06:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
but sometimes they are
 
06:07:45.910 --> 06:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
and when this bill comes in inevitably
 
06:07:48.230 --> 06:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
the process starts of lobbyists coming
 
06:07:50.628 --> 06:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
forward trying to make sure that
 
06:07:56.150 --> 06:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:56.160 --> 06:07:57.110 align:start position:0%
 
this

06:07:57.110 --> 06:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:07:59.350 --> 06:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
in in this public hearing i heard one
 
06:08:01.270 --> 06:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
new exception that i hadn't thought of
 
06:08:03.830 --> 06:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't it wasn't a represented
 
06:08:07.270 --> 06:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
constituency i have to imagine for
 
06:08:09.430 --> 06:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
everyone we find there there's probably
 
06:08:11.510 --> 06:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
another one that we haven't thought of
 
06:08:15.190 --> 06:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
um so i i echo the chairman's concerns
 
06:08:16.708 --> 06:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
06:08:18.948 --> 06:08:18.958 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
06:08:21.510 --> 06:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
make the right decision for every single
 
06:08:23.830 --> 06:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
employee in the state and
 
06:08:23.840 --> 06:08:24.948 align:start position:0%

representative sullivan okay um
 
06:12:13.270 --> 06:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
basically this uh amendment um my my
 
06:12:15.110 --> 06:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
name's on on this amendment as a
 
06:12:18.788 --> 06:12:18.798 align:start position:0%
courtesy to uh two prime sponsors one of
 
06:12:20.390 --> 06:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
them is uh
 
06:12:20.400 --> 06:12:21.270 align:start position:0%
them is uh
um

06:12:21.270 --> 06:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:23.350 --> 06:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative reed um
 
06:12:26.150 --> 06:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
who's the prime sponsor for 1386 the
 
06:12:28.948 --> 06:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
other is representative perez who is the
 
06:12:32.070 --> 06:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor for 1304 which was on our
 
06:12:34.230 --> 06:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
slate to be uh heard today
 
06:12:35.750 --> 06:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
and i understand that
 
06:12:37.990 --> 06:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
rep perez was
 
06:12:39.510 --> 06:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
had a medical emergency and was was
 
06:12:42.150 --> 06:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
unable to make it but uh regardless both
 
06:12:45.190 --> 06:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
reps um agreed to this and the reason
 
06:12:47.590 --> 06:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
for the amendment is simply that we
 
06:12:49.270 --> 06:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
ended up with two bills that we were
 
06:12:50.948 --> 06:12:50.958 align:start position:0%
incredibly similar
 
06:12:53.270 --> 06:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
and it didn't make sense to
 
06:12:55.270 --> 06:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
have them in competition with each other
 
06:12:57.590 --> 06:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
made better sense to uh
 
06:12:59.350 --> 06:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
simply combine them
 
06:13:01.510 --> 06:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
because one of them dealt with heat
 
06:13:03.830 --> 06:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
heat in the workplace
 
06:13:06.868 --> 06:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
referencing mostly interior spaces the
 
06:13:09.030 --> 06:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
other one dealt with heat and cold
 
06:13:11.990 --> 06:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
referencing primarily outdoor spaces
 
06:13:12.000 --> 06:13:13.430 align:start position:0%
referencing primarily outdoor spaces
so

06:13:13.430 --> 06:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:13:15.990 --> 06:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment combines both of them to
 
06:13:19.110 --> 06:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
the satisfaction of both prime sponsors
 
06:13:20.788 --> 06:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
i think it just cleans things up for the
 
06:13:24.070 --> 06:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
committee and makes it uh
 
06:13:25.990 --> 06:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
clearer for us to move forward on the
 
06:13:28.868 --> 06:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
issue that was put before us so i ask
 
06:13:31.350 --> 06:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
for your support simply because
 
06:13:31.360 --> 06:13:32.548 align:start position:0%
for your support simply because
it

06:13:32.548 --> 06:13:32.558 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:13:39.110 --> 06:13:39.120 align:start position:0%

you're recognized to speak to your
 
06:15:06.480 --> 06:15:10.868 align:start position:0%
you're recognized to speak to your
motion

06:15:10.868 --> 06:15:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:12.548 --> 06:15:12.558 align:start position:0%
i i do believe that there are problems
 
06:15:14.948 --> 06:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
in the workplace with uh with with
 
06:15:17.590 --> 06:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
temperatures osha recently uh came up
 
06:15:21.670 --> 06:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:23.350 --> 06:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
cold temperatures i believe it was no no
 
06:15:25.590 --> 06:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
it was it was heat in the workplace and
 
06:15:27.990 --> 06:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
essentially they've got a new tool for
 
06:15:29.830 --> 06:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
employers to use to assist their
 
06:15:32.230 --> 06:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
employees and i think
 
06:15:35.510 --> 06:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
the way this uh amended bill is put
 
06:15:35.520 --> 06:15:36.788 align:start position:0%
the way this uh amended bill is put
together

06:15:36.788 --> 06:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
together
 
06:15:39.750 --> 06:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:41.910 --> 06:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
for studying these things to figure out
 
06:15:43.990 --> 06:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
what types of guidance we can give to
 
06:15:45.750 --> 06:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
employers to help keep their workers
 
06:15:45.760 --> 06:15:46.628 align:start position:0%
employers to help keep their workers
safe

06:15:46.628 --> 06:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
safe
 
06:15:46.638 --> 06:15:48.788 align:start position:0%
safe
and

06:15:48.788 --> 06:15:48.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:15:50.548 --> 06:15:50.558 align:start position:0%
i'm all about worker safety and that's
 
06:15:53.190 --> 06:15:53.200 align:start position:0%
what this bill does so i ask for your
 
06:15:55.350 --> 06:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
support for ought to pass his amendment
 
06:15:59.190 --> 06:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:01.990 --> 06:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i am going to vote
 
06:16:03.830 --> 06:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
against this motion
 
06:16:03.840 --> 06:16:06.070 align:start position:0%
against this motion
um

06:16:06.070 --> 06:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:07.670 --> 06:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
one issue i have
 
06:16:10.470 --> 06:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
we had to postpone this vote because we
 
06:16:11.990 --> 06:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
had difficulty
 
06:16:14.948 --> 06:16:14.958 align:start position:0%
getting the people here to work on it
 
06:16:16.708 --> 06:16:16.718 align:start position:0%
we have a shortage of people we have a
 
06:16:19.270 --> 06:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
shortage of facilities there are a lot
 
06:16:21.670 --> 06:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
of concerns about people meeting and i
 
06:16:25.110 --> 06:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
think we have to be very cautious about
 
06:16:28.868 --> 06:16:28.878 align:start position:0%
how much we we set aside to study um in
 
06:16:30.628 --> 06:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
the upcoming months given all those
 
06:16:30.638 --> 06:16:31.910 align:start position:0%
the upcoming months given all those
conditions

06:16:31.910 --> 06:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
06:16:34.948 --> 06:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
i'm told that as much trouble as we have
 
06:16:37.430 --> 06:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
the senate is even more hard on this and
 
06:16:39.670 --> 06:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
they're not going to entertain
 
06:16:42.948 --> 06:16:42.958 align:start position:0%
um a lot of studies being passed
 
06:16:45.430 --> 06:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
if you're if my namesake from across the
 
06:16:47.030 --> 06:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
aisle thinks back to the previous
 
06:16:49.910 --> 06:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
session i gave a similar comment to a
 
06:16:52.948 --> 06:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
study bill that he proposed and i ended
 
06:16:56.230 --> 06:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
up supporting that on the house floor
 
06:16:58.788 --> 06:16:58.798 align:start position:0%
um and it passed and and has been
 
06:17:00.628 --> 06:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
enacted i think there are some
 
06:17:04.150 --> 06:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
differences here and for the future i i
 
06:17:08.390 --> 06:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:10.948 --> 06:17:10.958 align:start position:0%
the the bill to study the osha
 
06:17:13.590 --> 06:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
requirements for state workers
 
06:17:17.590 --> 06:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
had been a long time getting ready
 
06:17:20.948 --> 06:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
it had been submitted as a previous bill
 
06:17:23.190 --> 06:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
before that there was an ad
 
06:17:25.350 --> 06:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
advocacy group that had been working
 
06:17:27.910 --> 06:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
hard on it
 
06:17:31.190 --> 06:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
and i think in putting forth that study
 
06:17:34.708 --> 06:17:34.718 align:start position:0%
the sponsors knew very well
 
06:17:37.030 --> 06:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
what they were trying to accomplish
 
06:17:39.510 --> 06:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
where they would get the information and
 
06:17:42.070 --> 06:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
and what that information would be doing
 
06:17:43.670 --> 06:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
once passed
 
06:17:46.470 --> 06:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
we as legislators are not well most of
 
06:17:49.590 --> 06:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
us are not scientists or or data
 
06:17:49.600 --> 06:17:50.788 align:start position:0%
us are not scientists or or data
analysts

06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
analysts
 
06:17:53.270 --> 06:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
we legislate we get involved in that
 
06:17:55.990 --> 06:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
there ought to be a law
 
06:17:57.910 --> 06:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
point in the process
 
06:17:57.920 --> 06:17:59.430 align:start position:0%
point in the process
and

06:17:59.430 --> 06:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:18:02.390 --> 06:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
i fully sympathize with the sponsor she
 
06:18:04.390 --> 06:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
made the comment that she's done as much
 
06:18:07.270 --> 06:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
work as she could she's looking for help
 
06:18:09.030 --> 06:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
i would suggest
 
06:18:11.350 --> 06:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
that there's maybe a little bit further
 
06:18:14.470 --> 06:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
to go between it seems like there's a
 
06:18:17.510 --> 06:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
problem let's let's look at all the
 
06:18:18.948 --> 06:18:18.958 align:start position:0%
stuff out there
 
06:18:21.670 --> 06:18:21.680 align:start position:0%
and the point where we kind of see
 
06:18:23.750 --> 06:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
a problem the information that'll feed
 
06:18:26.548 --> 06:18:26.558 align:start position:0%
into the law so i suggest that
 
06:18:26.558 --> 06:18:28.470 align:start position:0%
into the law so i suggest that
especially

06:18:28.470 --> 06:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
especially
 
06:18:32.390 --> 06:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
in this time but probably in general too
 
06:18:35.270 --> 06:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
this is a concept that
 
06:18:37.270 --> 06:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
probably needs to be worked a little
 
06:18:37.280 --> 06:18:39.030 align:start position:0%
probably needs to be worked a little
more

06:18:39.030 --> 06:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:18:41.270 --> 06:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
before it belongs in a legislative study
 
06:18:41.280 --> 06:18:42.548 align:start position:0%
before it belongs in a legislative study
committee

06:18:42.548 --> 06:18:42.558 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:18:48.230 --> 06:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:52.150 --> 06:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
we agreed to uh support the amendment
 
06:18:54.150 --> 06:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
um because we wanted to at least you
 
06:18:56.390 --> 06:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
have that ability
 
06:18:58.070 --> 06:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
to move forward if you choose to on the
 
06:18:58.080 --> 06:18:58.948 align:start position:0%
to move forward if you choose to on the
floor

06:18:58.948 --> 06:18:58.958 align:start position:0%
floor
 
06:19:00.788 --> 06:19:00.798 align:start position:0%
um we have a couple problems and i'd
 
06:19:02.868 --> 06:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
like to just reiterate what the vice
 
06:19:04.230 --> 06:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
chairman said
 
06:19:05.750 --> 06:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
um you know how hard it is to find a
 
06:19:06.948 --> 06:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
senator they're not willing to play
 
06:19:08.628 --> 06:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
right now
 
06:19:11.030 --> 06:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
the speaker doesn't want a lot of
 
06:19:12.708 --> 06:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
study committees because
 
06:19:14.310 --> 06:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
certain individuals don't want to even
 
06:19:15.830 --> 06:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
come to the state house
 
06:19:17.590 --> 06:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
so this kind of defeats the purpose of
 
06:19:18.468 --> 06:19:18.478 align:start position:0%
they don't want to come to the state
 
06:19:20.070 --> 06:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
house but yet we want to have study
 
06:19:21.270 --> 06:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
committees to come to the state house
 
06:19:23.190 --> 06:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
and study
 
06:19:25.350 --> 06:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
i went online over the weekend and
 
06:19:27.110 --> 06:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
looked under osha and a few other things
 
06:19:30.310 --> 06:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
and there are volumes on
 
06:19:30.320 --> 06:19:32.468 align:start position:0%
and there are volumes on
heat

06:19:32.468 --> 06:19:32.478 align:start position:0%
heat
 
06:19:34.548 --> 06:19:34.558 align:start position:0%
prevention all these things that are
 
06:19:36.390 --> 06:19:36.400 align:start position:0%
that are there
 
06:19:37.670 --> 06:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to support this but
 
06:19:39.190 --> 06:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
what i will
 
06:19:40.788 --> 06:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
do is as chairman of the other study
 
06:19:40.798 --> 06:19:42.070 align:start position:0%
do is as chairman of the other study
committee

06:19:42.070 --> 06:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:19:44.310 --> 06:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
you can add this to that
 
06:19:45.750 --> 06:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
since we already have a senator which
 
06:19:46.948 --> 06:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
we're probably not going to get another
 
06:19:51.830 --> 06:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:53.270 --> 06:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
that that's what a
 
06:19:55.430 --> 06:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
compromise i can make that it will be
 
06:19:56.868 --> 06:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
you know in those discussions we can
 
06:19:58.708 --> 06:19:58.718 align:start position:0%
bring that up
 
06:20:00.548 --> 06:20:00.558 align:start position:0%
so i will be uh i won't be supporting it
 
06:20:02.390 --> 06:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
but um
 
06:20:04.468 --> 06:20:04.478 align:start position:0%
at least your amendment was uh well
 
06:20:04.478 --> 06:20:06.070 align:start position:0%
at least your amendment was uh well
appreciated

06:20:06.070 --> 06:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
06:20:10.310 --> 06:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:12.548 --> 06:20:12.558 align:start position:0%
english and the floors ought to pass
 
06:20:13.910 --> 06:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
with amendment if you're in favor you
 
06:20:17.190 --> 06:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
vote yes if you're opposed no mr clerk

understand if what you said uh
 
06:21:55.270 --> 06:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
previously was that your concept was
 
06:21:57.270 --> 06:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
that this the subject matter that's
 
06:21:58.948 --> 06:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
contained within this
 
06:22:01.670 --> 06:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
bill could be subject matter for an
 
06:22:05.110 --> 06:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
existing study committee
 
06:22:06.948 --> 06:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
that i would be willing to add it to

individuals in law enforcement who
 
06:27:46.150 --> 06:27:46.160 align:start position:0%

investigations um both of them were
 
06:27:51.350 --> 06:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
adamant that they thought this was not a
 
06:27:52.948 --> 06:27:52.958 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
06:27:55.830 --> 06:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
the other issue or the other
 
06:27:57.990 --> 06:27:58.000 align:start position:0%

06:28:06.548 --> 06:28:06.558 align:start position:0%
in court and
 
06:28:08.788 --> 06:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
they've only been required to turn over
 
06:28:11.430 --> 06:28:11.440 align:start position:0%

06:28:11.440 --> 06:28:13.110 align:start position:0%
something one time if i recall
um

06:28:13.110 --> 06:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:15.750 --> 06:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
they also mentioned the potential for
 
06:28:17.830 --> 06:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
additional litigation and
 
06:28:20.310 --> 06:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's just overall it's not a good idea
 
06:28:23.510 --> 06:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
they sign off if they're
 
06:28:24.788 --> 06:28:24.798 align:start position:0%
applying for employment they're
 
06:28:26.468 --> 06:28:26.478 align:start position:0%
obviously signing off on something that
 
06:28:27.750 --> 06:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
allows the
 
06:28:27.760 --> 06:28:28.948 align:start position:0%
allows the
background

06:28:28.948 --> 06:28:28.958 align:start position:0%
background
 
06:28:31.430 --> 06:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
check and investigation and final point
 
06:28:33.510 --> 06:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
as a couple of them said
 
06:28:33.520 --> 06:28:34.548 align:start position:0%
as a couple of them said
generally

06:28:34.548 --> 06:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
generally
 
06:28:36.070 --> 06:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
when they're denied employment they know
 
06:28:37.590 --> 06:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
the reason why
 
06:28:41.510 --> 06:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
so uh for those reasons i support itil
 
06:28:42.628 --> 06:28:42.638 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else i can speak
 
06:28:47.430 --> 06:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:47.440 --> 06:28:48.230 align:start position:0%
 
i

06:28:48.230 --> 06:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:28:51.510 --> 06:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
have to say that when i first saw this i
 
06:28:52.868 --> 06:28:52.878 align:start position:0%
it didn't
 
06:28:55.510 --> 06:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
strike me as being a law enforcement uh
 
06:28:58.310 --> 06:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
issue so i was frankly in in favor of
 
06:29:01.030 --> 06:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
providing these background checks um
 
06:29:02.708 --> 06:29:02.718 align:start position:0%
good example of when a hearing makes a
 
06:29:05.190 --> 06:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
difference um there are two very
 
06:29:05.200 --> 06:29:06.628 align:start position:0%
difference um there are two very
impressive

06:29:06.628 --> 06:29:06.638 align:start position:0%
impressive
 
06:29:10.948 --> 06:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
individuals who uh testified um and uh
 
06:29:13.030 --> 06:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
i was clearly persuaded that uh turning
 
06:29:15.350 --> 06:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
over these background checks
 
06:29:17.590 --> 06:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
would violate some confidentiality that
 
06:29:20.150 --> 06:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
would be detrimental to the process and
 
06:29:22.070 --> 06:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
possibly detrimental to people who
 
06:29:25.510 --> 06:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:27.990 --> 06:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
on the way home i was thinking to myself
 
06:29:28.000 --> 06:29:29.350 align:start position:0%
on the way home i was thinking to myself
that

06:29:29.350 --> 06:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:29:30.628 --> 06:29:30.638 align:start position:0%
probably not everyone who does
 
06:29:34.868 --> 06:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:38.628 --> 06:29:38.638 align:start position:0%
exceptional as those two folks were but
 
06:29:40.628 --> 06:29:40.638 align:start position:0%
that being said um
 
06:29:42.868 --> 06:29:42.878 align:start position:0%
i was certainly persuaded that
 
06:29:42.878 --> 06:29:44.070 align:start position:0%
i was certainly persuaded that
this

06:29:44.070 --> 06:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:29:45.350 --> 06:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
turning over these background checks
 
06:29:48.390 --> 06:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
would be a bad idea so i will
 
06:29:55.030 --> 06:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:56.708 --> 06:29:56.718 align:start position:0%
this was a difficult one for me because
 
06:29:59.830 --> 06:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
i like uh transparency in government
 
06:30:02.708 --> 06:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
and not let someone see that at first
 
06:30:05.190 --> 06:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
blush was was disconcerting
 
06:30:05.200 --> 06:30:06.230 align:start position:0%
blush was was disconcerting
um

06:30:06.230 --> 06:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:07.830 --> 06:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
i know this is not just for police it's
 
06:30:09.430 --> 06:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
fire and other
 
06:30:13.110 --> 06:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
um police in our society right now are
 
06:30:15.430 --> 06:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
under considerable scrutiny
 
06:30:17.110 --> 06:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:30:17.120 --> 06:30:17.990 align:start position:0%
and um
and

06:30:17.990 --> 06:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:30:19.910 --> 06:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
one of the comments was made by the the
 
06:30:22.230 --> 06:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
chief so i'll just cop you know
 
06:30:23.590 --> 06:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
repeat it you know we don't want a bad
 
06:30:23.600 --> 06:30:24.390 align:start position:0%
repeat it you know we don't want a bad
apple

06:30:24.390 --> 06:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
apple
 
06:30:25.910 --> 06:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
so they have to look at
 
06:30:28.390 --> 06:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
all these background checks and
 
06:30:29.830 --> 06:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
so to me it's like okay so what's the
 
06:30:31.590 --> 06:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
check and balance to make sure it's just
 
06:30:33.110 --> 06:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
not a personal issue
 
06:30:33.120 --> 06:30:33.910 align:start position:0%
not a personal issue
well

06:30:33.910 --> 06:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:30:36.310 --> 06:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
it's only happened a few times
 
06:30:38.948 --> 06:30:38.958 align:start position:0%
if you want you can file a
 
06:30:41.830 --> 06:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
a suit and that's all discoverable you
 
06:30:43.830 --> 06:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
can that get the discovery
 
06:30:46.150 --> 06:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
if the police think that
 
06:30:48.310 --> 06:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
through that discovery process
 
06:30:48.320 --> 06:30:49.750 align:start position:0%
through that discovery process
that

06:30:49.750 --> 06:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:30:51.030 --> 06:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
they probably don't want to give up that
 
06:30:53.110 --> 06:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
information about something especially
 
06:30:54.150 --> 06:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
if it was
 
06:30:57.430 --> 06:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
you know maybe a neighbor or a next
 
06:30:59.670 --> 06:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
relationship or something
 
06:31:01.350 --> 06:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
so then it can go in front of a judge
 
06:31:02.868 --> 06:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
and it's called in camera where the
 
06:31:04.468 --> 06:31:04.478 align:start position:0%
judge will sit there in front of the
 
06:31:06.230 --> 06:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
courtroom with both attorneys and he'll
 
06:31:07.590 --> 06:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
06:31:09.110 --> 06:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
and he'll make a determination of
 
06:31:10.868 --> 06:31:10.878 align:start position:0%
whether or not that that really should
 
06:31:12.708 --> 06:31:12.718 align:start position:0%
be given up or not without having to you
 
06:31:12.718 --> 06:31:13.750 align:start position:0%
be given up or not without having to you
know

06:31:13.750 --> 06:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:31:15.910 --> 06:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh put anyone possibly in any jeopardy
 
06:31:15.920 --> 06:31:16.788 align:start position:0%
uh put anyone possibly in any jeopardy
so

06:31:16.788 --> 06:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:31:19.190 --> 06:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
there are mechanisms
 
06:31:21.750 --> 06:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
and that with that
 
06:31:24.788 --> 06:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
uh i believe um that while
 
06:31:26.468 --> 06:31:26.478 align:start position:0%
we do need to have transparency in
 
06:31:29.030 --> 06:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
government this might be a place where
 
06:31:30.788 --> 06:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
the transparency happens but a further
 
06:31:33.270 --> 06:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
couple down the line
 
06:31:35.350 --> 06:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
so i'll be supporting the motion divide
 
06:31:38.070 --> 06:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
of itl
 
06:31:41.750 --> 06:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:43.670 --> 06:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none the emotion on the floor
 
06:31:45.990 --> 06:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
isn't expedient to legislate
 
06:31:48.390 --> 06:31:48.400 align:start position:0%

that need to
 
06:33:19.910 --> 06:33:19.920 align:start position:0%

you mr chairman um
 
06:33:43.990 --> 06:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
there was some back and forth with the
 
06:33:45.830 --> 06:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
department about whether
 
06:33:45.840 --> 06:33:47.190 align:start position:0%
department about whether
um

06:33:47.190 --> 06:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:33:48.948 --> 06:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
kerry should make payments directly
 
06:33:50.310 --> 06:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
whether the department should make
 
06:33:52.468 --> 06:33:52.478 align:start position:0%
payments directly
 
06:33:54.150 --> 06:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
how many issues there actually are per
 
06:33:54.160 --> 06:33:55.190 align:start position:0%
how many issues there actually are per
year

06:33:55.190 --> 06:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:33:57.510 --> 06:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
um i suggest
 
06:33:59.030 --> 06:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
if this is
 
06:34:00.548 --> 06:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
really an issue we should take up with
 
06:34:02.390 --> 06:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
the department come back with something
 
06:34:04.548 --> 06:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
better than this legislation thank you
 
06:34:06.868 --> 06:34:06.878 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
06:34:10.628 --> 06:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:14.628 --> 06:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
i i agree we um uh
 
06:34:16.390 --> 06:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte
 
06:34:17.990 --> 06:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
seaworth and i had
 
06:34:18.000 --> 06:34:18.868 align:start position:0%
seaworth and i had
some

06:34:18.868 --> 06:34:18.878 align:start position:0%
some
 
06:34:21.510 --> 06:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
considerable discussions about it
 
06:34:22.868 --> 06:34:22.878 align:start position:0%
you know should be part of the fine
 
06:34:24.468 --> 06:34:24.478 align:start position:0%
should it be a third of the fine what
 
06:34:26.310 --> 06:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
should it be i know there were some
 
06:34:29.350 --> 06:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
other calls made
 
06:34:30.948 --> 06:34:30.958 align:start position:0%
to the department trying to figure out
 
06:34:32.390 --> 06:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
how many
 
06:34:34.948 --> 06:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
i thoroughly agree that if someone is in
 
06:34:37.670 --> 06:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
a position where they're just egregious
 
06:34:38.788 --> 06:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
and they're
 
06:34:41.510 --> 06:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
continuously late paying people
 
06:34:41.520 --> 06:34:42.788 align:start position:0%
continuously late paying people
that

06:34:42.788 --> 06:34:42.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:34:44.948 --> 06:34:44.958 align:start position:0%
there's a potential where a fine
 
06:34:44.958 --> 06:34:46.150 align:start position:0%
there's a potential where a fine
should

06:34:46.150 --> 06:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
should
 
06:34:47.270 --> 06:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
be made
 
06:34:48.948 --> 06:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
as well as then
 
06:34:51.910 --> 06:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
maybe compensation to the
 
06:34:53.750 --> 06:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
employee or to the
 
06:34:55.030 --> 06:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
injured worker
 
06:34:57.110 --> 06:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
for having to wait
 
06:34:59.270 --> 06:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
we need some data as to how often it
 
06:34:59.280 --> 06:35:00.468 align:start position:0%
we need some data as to how often it
happens

06:35:00.468 --> 06:35:00.478 align:start position:0%
happens
 
06:35:02.230 --> 06:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
how frequent it happens are they mostly
 
06:35:03.510 --> 06:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
a day
 
06:35:04.628 --> 06:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
they didn't have a lot of the
 
06:35:06.468 --> 06:35:06.478 align:start position:0%
information we needed and they rarely
 
06:35:07.990 --> 06:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
utilize this
 
06:35:09.670 --> 06:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
so we don't know whether or not this is
 
06:35:11.350 --> 06:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
a problem and whether
 
06:35:13.430 --> 06:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'm all in favor of making it much
 
06:35:16.948 --> 06:35:16.958 align:start position:0%
harsher if it seems to be
 
06:35:18.548 --> 06:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
continuous with certain insurance
 
06:35:20.070 --> 06:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
carriers i am aware
 
06:35:21.670 --> 06:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
three or four years ago there was one
 
06:35:23.270 --> 06:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
and someone was brought to the carpet
 
06:35:25.190 --> 06:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
and almost lost their license to
 
06:35:26.708 --> 06:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
transact business in the state until
 
06:35:28.150 --> 06:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
they straightened up
 
06:35:29.990 --> 06:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
so the the department does seem to get
 
06:35:32.468 --> 06:35:32.478 align:start position:0%
on these things
 
06:35:34.628 --> 06:35:34.638 align:start position:0%
we get some better information
 
06:35:36.548 --> 06:35:36.558 align:start position:0%
from the department
 
06:35:40.150 --> 06:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
and we find that it is a problem
 
06:35:41.110 --> 06:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
i know
 
06:35:42.868 --> 06:35:42.878 align:start position:0%
the vice chairman i have discussed about
 
06:35:47.270 --> 06:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:47.280 --> 06:35:49.510 align:start position:0%
 
sullivan

06:35:49.510 --> 06:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
sullivan
 
06:35:51.910 --> 06:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
this this bill didn't really address the
 
06:35:54.310 --> 06:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
issue that uh i i think most of us
 
06:35:56.948 --> 06:35:56.958 align:start position:0%
recognize is
 
06:35:58.708 --> 06:35:58.718 align:start position:0%
the more serious issue which is late
 
06:36:02.230 --> 06:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
payments of regular weekly
 
06:36:05.110 --> 06:36:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh compensation um instead it was
 
06:36:08.310 --> 06:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
looking at the length of time it took
 
06:36:10.868 --> 06:36:10.878 align:start position:0%
to get a hearing done and then get the
 
06:36:10.878 --> 06:36:11.990 align:start position:0%
to get a hearing done and then get the
um

06:36:11.990 --> 06:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:15.030 --> 06:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
the compensation approved
 
06:36:15.040 --> 06:36:16.310 align:start position:0%
the compensation approved
and

06:36:16.310 --> 06:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:36:18.150 --> 06:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
it it seemed that
 
06:36:20.310 --> 06:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
hearings could get delayed by no fault
 
06:36:22.468 --> 06:36:22.478 align:start position:0%
of anybody's and the penalties could
 
06:36:22.478 --> 06:36:23.350 align:start position:0%
of anybody's and the penalties could
could

06:36:23.350 --> 06:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
could
 
06:36:26.830 --> 06:36:26.840 align:start position:0%
come come into play um
 
06:36:29.270 --> 06:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh without it really being the fault of
 
06:36:31.910 --> 06:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
anyone so um i guess i would like to see
 
06:36:33.990 --> 06:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
a bill that addresses late payments of
 
06:36:36.948 --> 06:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
regular compensation checks rather than
 
06:36:36.958 --> 06:36:37.990 align:start position:0%
regular compensation checks rather than
um

06:36:37.990 --> 06:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:41.430 --> 06:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
a slower than uh desirable um
 
06:36:44.390 --> 06:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
a hearing process
 
06:36:44.400 --> 06:36:45.510 align:start position:0%
a hearing process
so

06:36:45.510 --> 06:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:36:53.590 --> 06:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:56.868 --> 06:36:56.878 align:start position:0%
