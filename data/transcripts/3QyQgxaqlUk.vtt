00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to quickly call together the
 
00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
work section of the SB 296 subcommittee
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
and so we're going to be having the
 
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.250 align:start position:0%
and so we're going to be having the
pledge

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
pledge
 
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
shortly with when the full committee
 
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
comes so we'll we'll forgo The Pledge
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
right now in in favor of basically
 
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
having that for the for the full
 
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
committee and uh just kind of go
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
straight into it so we have I think a
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
couple of sessions where all of us
 
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
learned a lot I know that I did
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
and I think we were all in a position
 
00:09:17.509 --> 00:09:17.519 align:start position:0%
uh at the end where we were comfortable
 
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
with um the fact that the
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
original bill as submitted was not going
 
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:28.220 align:start position:0%
to be a bigger burden on the commission
 
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:32.700 align:start position:0%
uh than it already has in front of it so
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
you know with that going forward what I
 
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
would like to do is recommend to the
 
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.300 align:start position:0%
full committee
 
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
we're looking to go forward with
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
um with some of the uh the follow-up
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
items that we we kind of talked about we
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
um you know the concern with the
 
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.670 align:start position:0%
um you know the concern with the
caseload

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
caseload
 
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
um and we talked about
 
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.310 align:start position:0%
um and we talked about
um

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
the fact that uh their rules need to be
 
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
with that I I pretty much submitted the
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
the bulk of what I have to say to the
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
to the bulk of a subcommittee
 
00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:18.050 align:start position:0%
to the bulk of a subcommittee
um

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
I did get an email from Jay Henry who is
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh the director of performance audits
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
for the state and he did say that um the
 
00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
lpaoc is going to meet on November the
 
00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:33.590 align:start position:0%
lpaoc is going to meet on November the
10th

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
10th
 
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
he didn't specify exactly what time you
 
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:37.700 align:start position:0%
have to work a couple times he threw out
 
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339 align:start position:0%
and uh location but once that's kind of
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
firmed up it's my intention to go and
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
speak before the lpaoc to say that the
 
00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:50.579 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and hopefully we can
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
convince the full committee
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
um would would like to have a
 
00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:56.579 align:start position:0%
performance audit and representative
 
00:10:58.870 --> 00:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
Smith has
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
indicated an interest in you know
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
participating so if anybody else was
 
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
interested in doing so I do think it
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
would add weight
 
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
um I know that there's probably a lot of
 
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
areas that are going to be in
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
competition and there's only so much
 
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
room that uh that they have to navigate
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
so anything that we could do to kind of
 
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
strengthen the case
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I would certainly appreciate uh but
 
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
I did get some minor Corrections uh from
 
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.009 align:start position:0%
I did get some minor Corrections uh from
Jen

00:11:36.009 --> 00:11:36.019 align:start position:0%
Jen
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
for relative to uh some of the the
 
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
formatting and the only substantive
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
change that she made is in in my
 
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.509 align:start position:0%
change that she made is in in my
original

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:49.069 align:start position:0%
original
blurb

00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
blurb
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh what did I say rules rules would be
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh brought up to date
 
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:56.870 align:start position:0%
uh brought up to date
um

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
so she she added to that um uh rules
 
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
brought up to date and approved by the
 
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
joint legislative committee on
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
administrative rules so
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
um that was just a minor addition that
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
that she made to uh
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
to what I wrote
 
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.009 align:start position:0%
to what I wrote
so

00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:19.019 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
basically just where and that bottom
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph which says that the rules we
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
brought up to date
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
and she's adding the words and approved
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
by the joint legislative committee on
 
00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
administrative rules okay
 
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.130 align:start position:0%
administrative rules okay
so

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899 align:start position:0%
um that's basically where we're at does
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
anybody have any thoughts or concerns on
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
that before we go to the full committee
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:48.650 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
this was short and sweet then short and
 
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:53.820 align:start position:0%
sweet you have a question or would you
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
like in motion to
 
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
to support or approve your maybe report
 
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
uh that would be I would prefer a motion
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
to support it yes would you be would you
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
be interested in making such emotion I
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
would be pleased to make a motion that
 
00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:14.750 align:start position:0%
would be pleased to make a motion that
we

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
I guess adopt as a as a result of our
 
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
committee efforts that we adopt the
 
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
committee report
 
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
okay that might be happy to accept all
 
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.110 align:start position:0%
okay that might be happy to accept all
right

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
yes I'll I'd be happy to speak to that
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
and and and just because I didn't have
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
my mic on before I say that I'd make the
 
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
motion to a doctor committee report
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay and the
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
I have to say that
 
00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:52.129 align:start position:0%
I have to say that
the

00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
the committee which was well led by its
 
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.150 align:start position:0%
the committee which was well led by its
chair

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
and much appreciated
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
I think provided lots of information to
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
us with regard to the Human Rights
 
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.490 align:start position:0%
us with regard to the Human Rights
Commission

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.050 align:start position:0%
Commission
and

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
I'm absolutely convinced that changes
 
00:14:13.069 --> 00:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
need to be made to make the Human Rights
 
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
Commission more responsive to the people
 
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
and that the current system as it is
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
established in in large part established
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
by Statute
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
but as it's being implemented just is
 
00:14:31.449 --> 00:14:31.459 align:start position:0%
taking too long
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
and it just is not workable and I don't
 
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
think it can can continue to work in the
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
manner in which it is and I recognize
 
00:14:41.689 --> 00:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
that the director and other people at
 
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
the commission are attempting to make
 
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.509 align:start position:0%
the commission are attempting to make
change

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
uh within that and within those
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
parameters but
 
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think that we can wait for
 
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
a long period of time and first of all
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
not sure that the changes that have been
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
talked about really are going to bring
 
00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
about the type of success with
 
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
we would like to see happen out there
 
00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.750 align:start position:0%
we would like to see happen out there
but

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.250 align:start position:0%
but
I

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
just not convinced that the current
 
00:15:11.449 --> 00:15:11.459 align:start position:0%
system works can work for the people of
 
00:15:14.449 --> 00:15:14.459 align:start position:0%
the state and would hopefully in the
 
00:15:14.459 --> 00:15:15.610 align:start position:0%
the state and would hopefully in the
future

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:15.620 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
see major improvements and changes made
 
00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.410 align:start position:0%
see major improvements and changes made
Beyond

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
Beyond
 
00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
what we're coming out within our report
 
00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:26.090 align:start position:0%
what we're coming out within our report
today

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
well I mean I I think I agree that we
 
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
all had some major concerns
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
having kind of sat through the reporting
 
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
on on the uh parole board and and the
 
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
amount of depth that they went into my
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
hope really is that having a performance
 
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
audit will get into a lot of the depths
 
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
that that we just weren't able to do I
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
mean what we were able to do was really
 
00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
uncover a lot of problems but I still
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
don't think at the end of the day we
 
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
were able to drive to all the solutions
 
00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:08.579 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm really hoping and that
 
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
we're successful with with the
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
application for the lpaoc
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.509 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
I I feel
 
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
confident in being able to speak for
 
00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:31.019 align:start position:0%
every member of this subcommittee
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
that we became aware
 
00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.629 align:start position:0%
that we became aware
of

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
circumstances that
 
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
through no particular fault of anyone
 
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
um result in
 
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.430 align:start position:0%
um result in
unconscionable

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
unconscionable
 
00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:57.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
circumstances faced by people who have
 
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
gone to a state agency to ask for help
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
to wait two years three years four years
 
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
before there's resolution is
 
00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459 align:start position:0%
not acceptable it's wrong
 
00:17:17.459 --> 00:17:18.189 align:start position:0%
not acceptable it's wrong
um

00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:23.419 align:start position:0%
to have a clear uh
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
expression by the leadership
 
00:17:30.409 --> 00:17:30.419 align:start position:0%
of the commission that they don't have
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
the resources they need to carry out
 
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
the law and the rules as they are
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
required to
 
00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:41.690 align:start position:0%
required to
um

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
that is pretty serious they find
 
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
themselves in a position where they feel
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
they have to I guess play the hand that
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
they've been dealt
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
trying to make the best of it
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
the one example that stands out is by
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
coming into us and telling us that they
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
knew that the backlog was terrible and
 
00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
the caseload was terrible and they've
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
been able to cut that in half and when
 
00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299 align:start position:0%
we asked how did you get more money did
 
00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419 align:start position:0%
you get more stuff no they just took
 
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
half of the complaints and put them on
 
00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
the back burner
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
um and that's
 
00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:24.660 align:start position:0%
not something that anybody should be
 
00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:28.100 align:start position:0%
expected to do or anybody take pride in
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
and we as the legislature have an
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
obligation to make sure that people who
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
think we have in place a system
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we do in fact have a
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
system to help them so the work that was
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
done under the chairs
 
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
leadership is very very important and
 
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
the report
 
00:18:54.059 --> 00:18:54.770 align:start position:0%
the report
um

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
is worded I think skillfully
 
00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
and carefully
 
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
um not to gloss things over but also not
 
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.330 align:start position:0%
um not to gloss things over but also not
to

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:04.340 align:start position:0%

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
to resist the temptation for Vendetta
 
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Clerk
 
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
we have uh today our purpose of our
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
meeting today is to vote on
 
00:36:44.329 --> 00:36:44.339 align:start position:0%
reports on our retained bills we have
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
eight retained bills I did send around a
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
our interim study bills and I did send
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
around a list of those bills and the
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
reports that were published the
 
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
committee reports that came out in our
 
00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.650 align:start position:0%
committee reports that came out in our
calendar

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
I would say that we
 
00:37:05.569 --> 00:37:05.579 align:start position:0%
already had a meeting on this back on
 
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
June 8th there was a minority the
 
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
committee that did attend that day but
 
00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
we did go through the eight interim
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
study bills
 
00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
five of the bills we indicated that we
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
thought were fairly easily disposed of
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
with recommendations
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
one bill we decided to create a study
 
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
committee which we'll hear about later
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
and two bills we felt that it was
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
necessary that we made no couldn't come
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
up with a recommendation on and felt
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
that it was better to have the full
 
00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
committee act on those
 
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
I did
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
um prepare some committee reports on the
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
bills that we did act on that day but we
 
00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
didn't have a majority of the committee
 
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
that day and I think we still need to
 
00:37:59.329 --> 00:37:59.339 align:start position:0%
have the full committee vote on those
 
00:37:59.339 --> 00:38:02.030 align:start position:0%
have the full committee vote on those
bills

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
and what we'll do is we'll go through
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
the bills in order
 
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
uh in by order number by on the sheet
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
that you see here
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
and we'll begin with House Bill
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
124 and what I'll do is try to give you
 
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
a little bit of tell you what the
 
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
committee did when we met back on June
 
00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
8th and then you can decide what you
 
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
would like to do today
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to have a lot of
 
00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:31.970 align:start position:0%
discussion today on these bills
 
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.370 align:start position:0%
discussion today on these bills
[Music]

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:33.380 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
and because we have the committee's
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
already had a lot of discussion on these
 
00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
bills uh when we heard them uh the first
 
00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:43.730 align:start position:0%
bills uh when we heard them uh the first
time

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
and so I don't think we need a lot of
 
00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
discussion but
 
00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
um I'll entertain uh
 
00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
entertain what conversation I think we
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
need to have in order to make our
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations as required
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
so the first bill is House Bill 124
 
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
adopting the uniform real property
 
00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:11.220 align:start position:0%
and when the committee met back on June
 
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
8th the committee voted unanimously to
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
recommend for further legislation
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
the right now there is a uh the real
 
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
estate probate practitioners are
 
00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
putting together a a revised proposal
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
and I have an email which I just
 
00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.210 align:start position:0%
and I have an email which I just
received

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:37.220 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
from Elise salic and if you remember
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
Elise salik was the attorney who spoke
 
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:47.339 align:start position:0%
and I think pointed out many of the
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
flaws in The Proposal that we had before
 
00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.050 align:start position:0%
flaws in The Proposal that we had before
us

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh that day and she says I'm emailing
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
you to update the status on it on a new
 
00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
proposed transfer on death statute
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
we have drafted a totally new statute
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
based on the uniform act and our
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
drafting group met today to review that
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
initial draft we've divided the statute
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
into manageable sections each of which
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
will be reviewed and edited by our
 
00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:16.970 align:start position:0%
will be reviewed and edited by our
committee

00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
this is a complicated statute and we
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
need to carefully consider how deeds
 
00:40:23.329 --> 00:40:23.339 align:start position:0%
will be created and how our new statute
 
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
will tie into our existing probate laws
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
and our existing real estate conveyance
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
statute and our disclaimer statute and
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
our durable power of attorney statute
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
we'll be meeting again toward the end of
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
October to share our revisions
 
00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
and we are working diligently on the
 
00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:40.790 align:start position:0%
and we are working diligently on the
statute

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.990 align:start position:0%
statute
so

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
and I responded to that by saying that
 
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
we needed to have that done by November
 
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
1st so that it could be brought forward
 
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
as a statute
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
so with that I guess
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
we had previously recommended it or the
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
small committee had recommended it for
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
further legislation
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if other people have
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:14.579 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have a a little question
 
00:41:18.599 --> 00:41:20.089 align:start position:0%
thank you I do have a a little question
um

00:41:20.089 --> 00:41:20.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
about your comment Mr chair when you
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
said you told her that you needed to
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
have something by November 1st to
 
00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:31.270 align:start position:0%
have something by November 1st to
um

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
I don't see that by November 1st we have
 
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
to make a recommendation but we don't
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
have to write
 
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
an LSR we don't have to have language so
 
00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:43.849 align:start position:0%
an LSR we don't have to have language so
that

00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
um that November 1st is only for us not
 
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
not for her it would be after that but I
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
think that if I remember correctly
 
00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
that the conversation that took place
 
00:41:58.609 --> 00:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
around this and then the Senate bill
 
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
that we will also hear
 
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
um that they're very similar
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
um in the Senate Bill there was also an
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
amendment suggested I Believe by Senator
 
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
quote about
 
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.190 align:start position:0%
quote about
um

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:16.849 --> 00:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
making sure that no one was forced to
 
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
become a beneficiary against their
 
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
choice so that I think what we agreed to
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:26.829 align:start position:0%
was that
um

00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
we supported the concept but did think
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
that the language to be considered by
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
the next legislature would have to
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
address a number of concerns including
 
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
but not limited to the uh
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for the beneficiary to
 
00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
I think that's correct and the reason I
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
said November 1st wasn't for us to do
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
our recommendation I think the
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
reason I said that is because the filing
 
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
period I believe starts on November 9th
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
and so if we wanted to be able to file
 
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
legislation for next year it had to be
 
00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:18.530 align:start position:0%
legislation for next year it had to be
Timely

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%

00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
I'll make a motion I recommend for

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
we recommend
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:51.060 align:start position:0%

that makes it unanimous should be 19
right

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
19 to zero
 
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
19 in the affirmative zero in the
 
00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.530 align:start position:0%
19 in the affirmative zero in the
negative

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes could you refresh my fading
 
00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
memory about the procedure we've taken a
 
00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
vote do we have a blurb okay I don't
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
know a report that gets submitted also
 
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
or is there no report for this there is
 
00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
a report and the reports will appear in
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
the calendar
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and with the report then
 
00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
indicate that while we're recommending
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
this for further
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
legislation we believe that there
 
00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
are ways that the bill must be improved
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you in fact I already
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's why I made The Campaign which
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
would which I would be glad to uh to
 
00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:06.180 align:start position:0%
read to you and I said the bill clearly
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
has Merit for people who wish to pass
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
property onto others without the
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
formality of probate Administration or
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
the creation of a trust however the
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
initial bill lack protections against
 
00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
fraud and undue influence therefore the
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
committee decided that it needed more
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
work but State planning practitioners
 
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
have been working with the committee to
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
revise a proposal which will be
 
00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
the next bill was House Bill 248
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the judicial retirement plan
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
and when we met back on June 8th the
 
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
committee at that time voted unanimously
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
not to recommend for further legislation
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
and just by way of
 
00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.270 align:start position:0%
and just by way of
background

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:06.650 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
when it was presented to us it was
 
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
presented to us by representative Lynn
 
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
at the for at the first instance and
 
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
indicated that they needed to do an
 
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
amortization study
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
to determine what the effect was because
 
00:47:23.569 --> 00:47:23.579 align:start position:0%
I think the intention was that it could
 
00:47:26.089 --> 00:47:26.099 align:start position:0%
end up costing the state less if we
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
changed the plan so that judges had to
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
work longer in order to obtain their
 
00:47:34.250 --> 00:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
pension and that the pension benefits
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
would not be as rich as they currently
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
are for judges and I shouldn't say rich
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
as lucrative and so
 
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
they uh they did the amortization study
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I think the result was the
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
amortization study showed that basically
 
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be if they changed the
 
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
plan there wouldn't be that much of a
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
substantial savings so to the state and
 
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
any savings that would occur would be
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
over a extremely long period of time
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
so I don't think there was any
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
continuing interest in in pursuing the
 
00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:17.930 align:start position:0%
continuing interest in in pursuing the
bill

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I I have it in
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
front of me I should know the answer to
 
00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
this um that language wasn't retroactive
 
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
was it
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
no it was not retroactive it would apply
 
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.270 align:start position:0%

in the affirmative zero in the negative
 
00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:20.290 align:start position:0%
in the affirmative zero in the negative
and

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:20.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
I do
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
have a report would you like me to read
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
it I do yeah
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
I I indicate in the report that it's not
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation that
 
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
the bill would revise the calculation of
 
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits for judges under the
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
judicial retirement plan it would have
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
increased the time the judges are
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
required to serve in order to obtain
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
full retirement benefits
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
the intent would be to reduce the
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
contribution to be made to the plan by
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
the court system after completing an
 
00:50:52.609 --> 00:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
amortization study there did not appear
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
to be a substantial Financial benefit
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
and no further effort need be made to
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:05.579 align:start position:0%
if that's okay with everybody
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 379 relative to electronic
 
00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.430 align:start position:0%
House Bill 379 relative to electronic
notice

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
notice
 
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:13.740 align:start position:0%
again at our meeting on June 8th we
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
voted to not recommend for for the
 
00:51:16.559 --> 00:51:19.910 align:start position:0%
voted to not recommend for for the
legislation

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.490 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.890 align:start position:0%
uh
and

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
basically it comes down to the idea of
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not you want to change to do
 
00:51:35.089 --> 00:51:35.099 align:start position:0%
away with having
 
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh newspaper publication and substitute
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
it with basically web publication
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
this would have allowed
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
cities towns political subdivisions to
 
00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
do away with newspaper publication for
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.829 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative Horrigan
 
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:01.910 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative Horrigan
um

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
yes I think I think the newspapers still
 
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
have a role role in this there are
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
there are still like some people who
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
don't use the internet who still
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
subscribe to the internet and then
 
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
there's also like uh some stubborn old
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
people like me who insist on still
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
subscribing to the newspaper even though
 
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
it's getting smaller and smaller I read
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
the union leader this morning it took me
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
about five minutes and the Public
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
Notices were really like the most
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
interesting thing in the whole like
 
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
whole paper but that's uh
 
00:52:31.990 --> 00:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
and also a good thing about the paper is
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
every copy is every copy is definitely
 
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
the same you can save the newspaper if
 
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
there's something of specific
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
if you're particularly interested in the
 
00:52:44.329 --> 00:52:44.339 align:start position:0%
case and then also there are libraries
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
and there's newspapers.com which archive
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
these things so you have a reliable
 
00:52:50.569 --> 00:52:50.579 align:start position:0%
record what the notice actually said and
 
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:52.140 align:start position:0%
I'd be worried if it was all electronic
 
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
then the older messages would kind of
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
disappear into the uh into the into the
 
00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
ether as it were like in the hey I could
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
easily also Imagine in some cases where
 
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
there might be a dispute over what it
 
00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:06.059 align:start position:0%
was to notice actually said in the first
 
00:53:07.609 --> 00:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
place but if we have it in the newspaper
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
you know we can you can dig up the old
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
newspaper somewhere and see exactly like
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
what it was it said and then I don't
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
mind subsidizing the uh subsidizing
 
00:53:18.049 --> 00:53:18.059 align:start position:0%
newspapers I said that's pretty much the
 
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
only thing interesting thing that's left
 
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
in a lot of these local papers um some
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
so so I agree with the commission's uh
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation to not recommend it for
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
did you want to make that emotion oh I
 
00:53:35.089 --> 00:53:35.099 align:start position:0%
can make the motion if you want me to
 
00:53:35.099 --> 00:53:36.589 align:start position:0%
can make the motion if you want me to
appears

00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
appears
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
so I moved do we not recommend it for
 
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
and moved by representative Horrigan
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative chase that
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
we make House Bill 379 not recommended
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
and I'll represent vandros you felt
 
00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I feel very strongly about it
 
00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
because there are many uh which I'm in
 
00:54:14.089 --> 00:54:14.099 align:start position:0%
the same group older people
 
00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:17.099 align:start position:0%
who do not use the internet and they
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
find other ways to find the information
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
they want and even though newspapers are
 
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
getting smaller and smaller many people
 
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
still subscribe to them and that's how
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
they get their information and
 
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
until everybody has computers and
 
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
websites etc etc I uh I'm totally
 
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
on the motion of not recommending
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
Hospital 379 for future legislation

Simpson yes Mr chairman yes once again
 
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
we have 19 in the affirmative zero in
 
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
the negative
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
but we've adopted
 
00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
we've adopted the recommendation of not
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation for
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
when does it report to
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
or we've already prepared
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
um actually I have a report which I've
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
no the I did reports for the ones that
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
we addressed back on June 8th so there
 
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
were five
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
that the Comm the committee the members
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
who met on June 8th recommended and so I
 
00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
did a report on each of those five just
 
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
to save us time
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
and to save everybody else from having
 
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:28.140 align:start position:0%
to write them
 
00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
and then and I've also uh included a the
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
report which representative McLean has
 
00:56:38.510 --> 00:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
already done on his his so they're only
 
00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:40.140 align:start position:0%
going to be two reports that need to be
 
00:56:41.329 --> 00:56:41.339 align:start position:0%
done and then we're going to figure out
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
who has to do those today
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
but the the report that I do have for
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
379 is the bill defines electronic
 
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
notice and authorizes electronic notice
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
in lieu of newspaper notifications and
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
statutes that require a city town or
 
00:56:58.490 --> 00:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
other political subdivision to provide
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
notice of a meeting hearing or other
 
00:57:00.119 --> 00:57:01.069 align:start position:0%
notice of a meeting hearing or other
event

00:57:01.069 --> 00:57:01.079 align:start position:0%
event
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
as print media evolves into more
 
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
web-centered formats it may eventually
 
00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
become outdated however many of our
 
00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:11.339 align:start position:0%
constituents do not have access or to or
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
utilize web services daily in time we
 
00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
may be able to transition to this type
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
of format but the committee believes
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
that we need to include all citizens who
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
want to keep informed of the activities
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
of their government boards
 
00:57:28.790 --> 00:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
that looks okay to everybody
 
00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:34.140 align:start position:0%
okay and the next bill is a bill for
 
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
which we made no recommendation at the
 
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
at the last uh meeting and that's House
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 1181 allowing the biological father
 
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
of an unborn child to petition the court
 
00:57:47.329 --> 00:57:47.339 align:start position:0%
for an injunction prohibiting the
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
biological mother from having an
 
00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:51.470 align:start position:0%
biological mother from having an
abortion

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:53.329 align:start position:0%
abortion
and

00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:53.339 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:59.329 --> 00:57:59.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would like to
 
00:58:02.089 --> 00:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
move that we um
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
do not recommend that this bill
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
um be considered for further legislation
 
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
is there a second to that
 
00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
who's second the representative Chase
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
yep yes I would be happy
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
um to make uh this discussion
 
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.730 align:start position:0%
um to make uh this discussion
uh

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
there actually has been some water
 
00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
either under the bridge or over the dams
 
00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:40.849 align:start position:0%
either under the bridge or over the dams
since

00:58:40.849 --> 00:58:40.859 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
um we met in June
 
00:58:43.619 --> 00:58:44.450 align:start position:0%
um we met in June
um

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
relating to issues of Reproductive
 
00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:49.069 align:start position:0%
relating to issues of Reproductive
Rights

00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:52.040 align:start position:0%
um but nonetheless the core principles
 
00:58:56.089 --> 00:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
continue and that is
 
00:58:58.190 --> 00:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
the right of a woman
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
to control
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
to make decisions concerning her own
 
00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:08.990 align:start position:0%
to make decisions concerning her own
body

00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
I say that recognizing that there is not
 
00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
a uniformity of opinion
 
00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:19.940 align:start position:0%
and I understand that and uh give full
 
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
Credence to the Views that other people
 
00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:23.510 align:start position:0%
Credence to the Views that other people
have

00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire is a state that for
 
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
most of its years
 
00:59:33.289 --> 00:59:33.299 align:start position:0%
has adopted the libertarian the classic
 
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
libertarian philosophy that government
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
does not belong
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
um in um
 
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
and its citizens private lives and this
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
is one more example where the person
 
00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.870 align:start position:0%
is one more example where the person
most

00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:54.299 align:start position:0%
Central to the issue shouldn't be able
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
to decide who to consult who to involve
 
01:00:01.789 --> 01:00:01.799 align:start position:0%
who to help make decisions that affect
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
her life and her future and
 
01:00:06.119 --> 01:00:07.150 align:start position:0%
her life and her future and
um

01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
and she might very well choose to have
 
01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:13.250 align:start position:0%
and she might very well choose to have
her

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
her partner her spouse perhaps if it is
 
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:19.140 align:start position:0%
in fact a spouse her religious leader
 
01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
and certainly her
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
um medical provider involved but I don't
 
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:28.380 align:start position:0%
think there's room for 424 legislators
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
in the decision and so that is why I
 
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
believe it's not ready for
 
01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:41.809 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
I know that this is a bill which
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
generates uh strong opinions but I know
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
that we debated this bill
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh quite a bit already and in our
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
committee I don't know that we need to
 
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
have a lot of debate here today if
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
you're willing to vote on the motion
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.069 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak I would like to
 
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
speak okay you have a right to speak
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chairman and I concur
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
we have discussed this at once there was
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
a significant division of at least in my
 
01:01:19.370 --> 01:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
mind in the community before and which
 
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
is why it's here for interim study
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
the representative from Durham this is a
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
bill about the government not being
 
01:01:34.609 --> 01:01:34.619 align:start position:0%
involved that's the point of it is to
 
01:01:34.619 --> 01:01:36.109 align:start position:0%
involved that's the point of it is to
allow

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
the father
 
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
who is
 
01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:42.299 align:start position:0%
one of the two parents
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
to have some say
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
in the life of the child
 
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
and the bill before us as it was written
 
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
recognize that the mother's rights were
 
01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.990 align:start position:0%
recognize that the mother's rights were
preeminent

01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
preeminent
 
01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
and the father's rights would be
 
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.670 align:start position:0%
and the father's rights would be
subservient

01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
but that the father should have rights
 
01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
and I say why wouldn't the Father the
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
father should have the same I don't know
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
reproductive Freedom if you want to come
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
with that that's the month
 
01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:17.160 align:start position:0%
so I will be voting that we should
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
recommend it
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
and that's as far as I need to go with
 
01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.450 align:start position:0%
and that's as far as I need to go with
that

01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:24.770 align:start position:0%

01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
board in um which was a different change
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
affected land use law in in action now
 
01:05:59.569 --> 01:05:59.579 align:start position:0%
for two years and it's working pretty
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
well as far as uh expeding up the land
 
01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
use docket I also feel like
 
01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
um to
 
01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:07.730 align:start position:0%
um to
um

01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:11.819 align:start position:0%
to to carve off this section might make
 
01:06:11.819 --> 01:06:13.490 align:start position:0%
to to carve off this section might make
um

01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
and not a you know may start
 
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
um if it's they're just delegated to one
 
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
judge there may be some bias that gets
 
01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
it reinforced in that over the years
 
01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
um and I also think the testimony um
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
there really was some um this was not
 
01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
really clearly needed or desired by the
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
practitioners or the court so I I'd like
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
to just um wait on this for a little
 
01:06:33.839 --> 01:06:37.789 align:start position:0%
to just um wait on this for a little
while

01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative
 
01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.270 align:start position:0%
any other discussion representative
McLean

01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
McLean
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:06:47.089 --> 01:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
um it is my understanding that um the
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
while the court did not testify in favor
 
01:06:52.609 --> 01:06:52.619 align:start position:0%
of it at the time they did come back to
 
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
us after and say yeah this is something
 
01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
actually that they would be in favor of
 
01:06:59.630 --> 01:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
and in fact as you mentioned that they
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
were looking to put money in and and the
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
reason for that is because they see a
 
01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
lot of inconsistency with respect to uh
 
01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
how the law is being applied so the
 
01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:13.859 align:start position:0%
towns would still have the same
 
01:07:16.250 --> 01:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
flexibility to make their own you know
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
bylaws and rules it's just that how it's
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
applied in the courts the hope with this
 
01:07:23.569 --> 01:07:23.579 align:start position:0%
is that you're going to just have more
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
consistency with respect to the decision
 
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
representative Smith Mr chair would it
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
be permissible to you and the committee
 
01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
if we ask
 
01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:38.870 align:start position:0%
if we ask
um

01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
Mr head to answer a couple of questions
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
I'd rather not okay then could I just
 
01:07:58.490 --> 01:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
um make a couple of points where I won't
 
01:08:02.089 --> 01:08:02.099 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to validate the
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
um the accuracy if I could please
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
um I'd be curious if I were permitted to
 
01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:09.650 align:start position:0%
um I'd be curious if I were permitted to
ask

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:08:11.809 --> 01:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:08:11.819 --> 01:08:13.510 align:start position:0%
um uh
if

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
the uh the courts increased the bottom
 
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
line of the request to the governor
 
01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:23.110 align:start position:0%
line of the request to the governor
um

01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
or if they took money from some other uh
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
other purpose to apply it for this that
 
01:08:31.849 --> 01:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
would be my first question that I would
 
01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
ask my second question would be how
 
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
close is the court
 
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
to having a full complement of judges in
 
01:08:48.950 --> 01:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
all the requisite Court levels
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
um so that it would not be required to
 
01:08:59.329 --> 01:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
take a judge from another purpose to use
 
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
for this purpose
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
and my third question would be would it
 
01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
not make more sense for the court to
 
01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
have an effective
 
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
training program
 
01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
for its judges so that the
 
01:09:19.849 --> 01:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies are no more than the
 
01:09:22.249 --> 01:09:22.259 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies that you would have when
 
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
reasonable people differ on on certain
 
01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
outcomes but nonetheless the decisions
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
would be based on the law and
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
regulations as they are all of those
 
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
reasons cause me to think that um and
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
due course this might make sense but
 
01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
um I do not I do not have the
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
verification that I would want to know
 
01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
that in fact the judicial branch is is
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.370 --> 01:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you if this if we
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
if we had passed this bill and signed
 
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
into the law it would have taken effect
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2023 and then about five
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
five and a half months or so after that
 
01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
we would have passed a new new budget so
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
it would have been effectively
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
meaningless because one of the topics
 
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
which is included in every now I can't
 
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
remember whether this is I guess things
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
is an hb2 the trailer build in any case
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
every budget
 
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
always there's always a debate over the
 
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
number of Superior Court Justices we
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
should have so essentially we'd be
 
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
adding one but there's no guarantee we
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be taking one away
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
um immediately afterwards in fact we
 
01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:39.780 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't even have been able to
 
01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:40.850 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't even have been able to
like

01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
hire the person and confirm them before
 
01:10:45.169 --> 01:10:45.179 align:start position:0%
like the budget process was done so I
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
think um
 
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
I think a standalone bill is unnecessary
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
and certainly absolutely
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
but it's not at all a surprise discover
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
that this is already going to be an
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
issue in the next budget because it it's
 
01:11:00.050 --> 01:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
always an issue in the next budget and
 
01:11:01.550 --> 01:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
certainly the
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
basic uh basic concept um is is an
 
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
interesting one but you know the next
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
finance committee will be dealing with
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
that so I don't think there's any need
 
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
any need for us to make any
 
01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh now so I agree with
 
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
the not to recommend for future
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
legislation motion um
 
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
given that I know there's a bill which
 
01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
will have this along with many other
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
issues uh coming down pretty soon and
 
01:11:27.169 --> 01:11:27.179 align:start position:0%
if if we're if I'm lucky enough to be
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
re-elected I'm sure I'll be able to vote
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
on that and I'm sure I'm sure we we all
 
01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:34.940 align:start position:0%
feel the same way thanks
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
I I have to say that I'm torn on it I
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
think the
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
the issue for me is do I think it would
 
01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
be good to have a uh a a a court with a
 
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
land use docket and the answer to that
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
is yeah I do and I do because
 
01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
um one of the advantages of having every
 
01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
every every lawyer knows that when you
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
go to court if you know the judge you
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
can you have an expectation you
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
generally know have a sense of how a
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
judge is going to rule and it makes the
 
01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
law much more predictable and practical
 
01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.030 align:start position:0%
law much more predictable and practical
and

01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
and if you focus on land use you can
 
01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
make the time frames because one of the
 
01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
big problems with land use cases right
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
now is they take forever and it
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
discourages everybody from being
 
01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
involved if you want to contest a zoning
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
board decision or if you're a developer
 
01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
and you want to put in a development and
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
so I think the land use docket has the
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
the the the other side of it so I
 
01:12:45.229 --> 01:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
I think generally yes I would look for
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
future legislation to have a land use
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
board it makes sense to me but
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
the issue I have right now is the status
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
of the courts because the courts aren't
 
01:12:58.189 --> 01:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
operating very effectively right now in
 
01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
terms of their time frames and getting
 
01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:02.900 align:start position:0%
things done and the backups in the court
 
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
and saying well geez do you want to
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
create a new program when the Court's
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
backed up and doesn't make that doesn't
 
01:13:13.790 --> 01:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
make sense to me but so I think I'm
 
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.910 align:start position:0%
make sense to me but so I think I'm
gonna

01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%

01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
oppose the because I think it's a good
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%

remember why but I I liked this bill and
 
01:16:38.930 --> 01:16:38.940 align:start position:0%
I thought it had a lot of Merit I spent
 
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
time this morning going through the
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
emails that we we got in support of the
 
01:16:45.649 --> 01:16:45.659 align:start position:0%
bill with with recommended changes and
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
then I see somebody provided us all with
 
01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
with a copy of that so I would be happy
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%

01:17:08.330 --> 01:17:08.340 align:start position:0%
we recommend future legislation seconded
 
01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
by representative wolper
 
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%

01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:21.590 align:start position:0%
no we can we can vote on it
Macbeth

01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
Macbeth
 
01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
so um I just I'm going to say I think
 
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
that this issue is important
 
01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:29.219 align:start position:0%
um I think that the the commission the
 
01:17:30.649 --> 01:17:30.659 align:start position:0%
domestic violence commission is doing a
 
01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
lot of good work and I understand that
 
01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:33.860 align:start position:0%
they're reviewing all the protocols
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
regarding domestic violence so I'm
 
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully not going to support this
 
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
bill because I think there's going to be
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations that are going to come
 
01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:42.950 align:start position:0%
recommendations that are going to come
in

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
um that that really are going to focus
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
yeah representative wolper thank you Mr
 
01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.149 align:start position:0%
yeah representative wolper thank you Mr
chairman

01:17:56.149 --> 01:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
if we're going to have future
 
01:17:59.209 --> 01:17:59.219 align:start position:0%
legislation and we know it because it's
 
01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:00.659 align:start position:0%
such an important issue why wouldn't we
 
01:18:03.530 --> 01:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
just recommend for future legislation
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.810 --> 01:18:16.820 align:start position:0%
well I think the issue
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
in fact you could vote for future
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
legislation for any subject matter but
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
I think the question was whether or not
 
01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
you would recommend this bill for future
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
legislation so and I think that's what
 
01:18:32.209 --> 01:18:32.219 align:start position:0%
the concern and the concern that I had
 
01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
with the bill and that is if you read
 
01:18:37.010 --> 01:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
the bill literally
 
01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
it requires this as a support person to
 
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
be provided for any party
 
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
which means
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
Not only would you be providing
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
representation for victims you could be
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
providing represent you'd be providing a
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:57.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:59.630 --> 01:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think that that was certainly
 
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
the intention but I think that's the way
 
01:19:03.770 --> 01:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
the bill is written the one thing it
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
says is that you can't the one thing
 
01:19:08.930 --> 01:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
that bill says is that the it absolutely
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
says the judge cannot control the
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
support person can has no authority over
 
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
the support person
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
so the support person could get up and
 
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
rant and Rave in the court and the judge
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
can't do anything about it
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh the court person could swear in the
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
court can't do anything about it the
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
can I get engage and be noisy disruptive
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
argue with the other party
 
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
judge can't do anything about it the way
 
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
the current bill is written then that
 
01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense
 
01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
it raises some other issues you uh with
 
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:52.370 align:start position:0%
regard to
um

01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
the Intensive part was and I think there
 
01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
was testimony that the support person be
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
able to go up on the stand while a
 
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:03.719 align:start position:0%
person is testifying
 
01:20:03.719 --> 01:20:04.729 align:start position:0%
person is testifying
um

01:20:04.729 --> 01:20:04.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
how does that prejudice a jury
 
01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
does it Prejudice a jury
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh I think that's a that that's an issue
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
to wrestle with you know we we had a
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill about allowing people to have dogs
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
up there we didn't want dogs up there
 
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
because it would Prejudice the jury
 
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
uh so you're going to allow a support
 
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
person up there to do that I
 
01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:28.669 align:start position:0%
person up there to do that I
um

01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:30.649 --> 01:20:30.659 align:start position:0%
so I just
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh with all respected representative gay
 
01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
who I know is doing it absolutely uh
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
what she believes is the right thing I
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
can't I just don't I just don't see this
 
01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:47.219 align:start position:0%
bill as being workable and the domestic
 
01:20:50.090 --> 01:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
and I'll go one one other thing I'd like
 
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
to say about it is
 
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
the that we do have the domestic
 
01:20:56.209 --> 01:20:56.219 align:start position:0%
violence task force they already came
 
01:20:58.370 --> 01:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
out with one report
 
01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:02.340 align:start position:0%
and we do Supply support persons right
 
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
now through the local agencies
 
01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
and but when they came out with the task
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
force they said what people people what
 
01:21:15.169 --> 01:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
people really need in domestic violence
 
01:21:18.290 --> 01:21:18.300 align:start position:0%
cases is not a support person
 
01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
what they need is a voice
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
what they need is attorneys only 13
 
01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
percent of the people who appear
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
as as plaintiffs in domestic violence
 
01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
cases are represented by an attorney
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
defendants are more likely to be
 
01:21:36.649 --> 01:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
represented by attorneys
 
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
many of these people are intimidated by
 
01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
the court system
 
01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:43.739 align:start position:0%
they don't know what to say there is a
 
01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
legal standard that you have to prove
 
01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
you have to show that they've engaged in
 
01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
Behavior which is effectively a criminal
 
01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:52.490 align:start position:0%
Behavior which is effectively a criminal
act

01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
act
 
01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
um they don't know what to say they
 
01:21:56.689 --> 01:21:56.699 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do and what they
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
really need is a voice what they really
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
need is somebody to speak on their
 
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
behalf in many cases and so long of the
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
short is I
 
01:22:09.470 --> 01:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
I I can't support the bill because I the
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
way it's written I just don't think it's
 
01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
workable at all in fact I think it's
 
01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:14.390 align:start position:0%
workable at all in fact I think it's
harmful

01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
harmful
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
um and yes it could be modified but just
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
to say well you know we could we could
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
come up with a better plan for domestic
 
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
violence I think that's true but I think
 
01:22:28.189 --> 01:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
Coalition thought the Coalition but the
 
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
domestic Governor's domestic violence
 
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
task force could do that
 
01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
that's a long show that's it so just to
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
I I agree with that and um
 
01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
representative gay I want to say you
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
know I have worked for 15 years with
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
with Haven on the Seacoast and
 
01:22:45.189 --> 01:22:45.199 align:start position:0%
representing women in their final
 
01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
domestic violence restraining orders and
 
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
also in my family practice I work some
 
01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.209 align:start position:0%
also in my family practice I work some
but

01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:50.219 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
um the issue is a lot of times the
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
victim it's not only the defendant that
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
she's getting able to get the temporary
 
01:22:58.610 --> 01:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
restraining about it's a dynamic within
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
the family and if you have an untrained
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
someone that's untrained supporting them
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
it might be someone that's part of that
 
01:23:07.490 --> 01:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
system an example of a family member
 
01:23:08.930 --> 01:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
that needs housing and so they're
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
they're supporting that purse that
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
victim but really they also have um you
 
01:23:16.669 --> 01:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
know just she's worried about my kids
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
going to lose housing orders my son
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
going to lose housing you know or my
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
adult adult people so I think it's
 
01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
dangerous um and I've seen it when you
 
01:23:25.729 --> 01:23:25.739 align:start position:0%
have an untrained Advocate you know
 
01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
luckily in Rockingham County a lot most
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
every of our you know anyone that
 
01:23:31.729 --> 01:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
contacts Havens does get an advocate and
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
I support advocates so when you ask me
 
01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
where's and why not support this because
 
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
I do see it very destructive to have
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
somebody that is not trained and the
 
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
court can't control because that's going
 
01:23:46.729 --> 01:23:46.739 align:start position:0%
to reflect badly so I do I think the
 
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
attorney reference legal representation
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
is critical
 
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
um a you know Advocate that's trained in
 
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
trauma is critical but I think other
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
people is well-meaning as this bill is
 
01:23:59.810 --> 01:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
would be very destructive
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:07.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
and I guess you could call the roll
 
01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.490 --> 01:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
I thought you were going to speak no no
 
01:24:18.770 --> 01:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
01:24:21.850 --> 01:24:21.860 align:start position:0%
uh 1435 right
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%

rights this is in fact a
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
Bill where we had a subcommittee and uh
 
01:31:39.709 --> 01:31:39.719 align:start position:0%
caught up on the chair of the sub
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
committee to make a motion if he wishes
 
01:31:44.209 --> 01:31:44.219 align:start position:0%
to do so yeah Mr chair I would make a
 
01:31:46.189 --> 01:31:46.199 align:start position:0%

01:31:46.199 --> 01:31:52.490 align:start position:0%

01:31:52.490 --> 01:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
moved by representative McLean future
 
01:31:58.570 --> 01:31:58.580 align:start position:0%

01:32:02.090 --> 01:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative nodder
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
do you like to address your emotion
 
01:32:07.850 --> 01:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair so
 
01:32:12.110 --> 01:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
um the original Bill SB 296 as it was
 
01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
presented to the committee uh basically
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
what it did is it eliminated the right
 
01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
of the respondent
 
01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
um to remove uh the case being brought
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
before the Human Rights Commission to
 
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court after finding a
 
01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
probable cause and so um the the intent
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
of the bill was basically the claimant
 
01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:36.900 align:start position:0%
has gone all the way you know to the to
 
01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
the five yard line and at which point
 
01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
the whole game gets moved to to a
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
different stadium and so when we looked
 
01:32:48.649 --> 01:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
at it actually
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
48 states do not allow the removing by
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
the respondent to the Superior Court
 
01:32:58.729 --> 01:32:58.739 align:start position:0%
there's only two states of which New
 
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one and
 
01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:02.149 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one and
um

01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:04.729 --> 01:33:04.739 align:start position:0%
our law that allows that removal was
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
basically modeled after a Massachusetts
 
01:33:09.490 --> 01:33:09.500 align:start position:0%
law which the Supreme Court found to be
 
01:33:12.169 --> 01:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional because the claimant
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
has the the the burden of proof the the
 
01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
heavier burden of proof in the case
 
01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
um they're the ones that get to to
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
choose the Forum and so
 
01:33:26.450 --> 01:33:26.460 align:start position:0%
um from a constitutional legal
 
01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
perspective everything about SB 296 was
 
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
okay it's fully constitutional
 
01:33:35.810 --> 01:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
everything was good there the the
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
concern that we had and the reason that
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
we decided to to pull it off for interim
 
01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
study was there was concern that the the
 
01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission was just
 
01:33:49.490 --> 01:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
overburdened and if there was not this
 
01:33:52.129 --> 01:33:52.139 align:start position:0%
right of removal then all of these cases
 
01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
are going to end up staying at the Human
 
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission and the commission
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
which is already bogged down is going to
 
01:34:02.689 --> 01:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
be bogged down even more so so what we
 
01:34:05.810 --> 01:34:05.820 align:start position:0%
did is we went and we gathered data and
 
01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
we talked about this in the subcommittee
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
we looked at the removal rates
 
01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
basis versus the amount of cases which
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
are being brought on each month uh by
 
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission and when we
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
looked at that we really found that this
 
01:34:25.129 --> 01:34:25.139 align:start position:0%
is not a significant burden for them to
 
01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
be taking on outside of what they
 
01:34:30.169 --> 01:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
already had so from a legal perspective
 
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
SB 296 was sound and from an additional
 
01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
burden we're talking you know maybe 10
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
cases a year are being removed from the
 
01:34:42.890 --> 01:34:42.900 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission to Superior
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
Court and the Human Rights Commission is
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
actually taking on 20 to 30 cases a
 
01:34:51.229 --> 01:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
month being docketed so so we really
 
01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
didn't see any barrier there but the
 
01:34:57.010 --> 01:34:57.020 align:start position:0%
bigger concern and where we kind of
 
01:34:59.570 --> 01:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
started to look in a little bit more
 
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
detail is just the effectiveness of the
 
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission itself and the
 
01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission basically
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
they're in a state right now where
 
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
they're kind of in steady state so if
 
01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
they have 20 or 30 cases coming in a
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
month they have 20 or 30 cases coming
 
01:35:20.090 --> 01:35:20.100 align:start position:0%
out but they have this backlog of about
 
01:35:22.209 --> 01:35:22.219 align:start position:0%
300 cases
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
that really are just kind of hanging
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
there and so if you kind of addressed
 
01:35:31.010 --> 01:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
them on a first in first out basis in
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
many cases people are going in the
 
01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
extreme to five years before they get to
 
01:35:38.689 --> 01:35:38.699 align:start position:0%
a probable cause hearing so the statute
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
really says that you have two years to
 
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
basically to get to that probable cause
 
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
resolution so they've been working with
 
01:35:48.229 --> 01:35:48.239 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's department they
 
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
they looked at streamlining certain
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
elements of the operations we'd ask for
 
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
some data around that just to basically
 
01:35:58.250 --> 01:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
look at from the time that an
 
01:36:01.370 --> 01:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
investigator is assigned to a case to
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
the time that probable cause is found
 
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
has anything shifted with that we really
 
01:36:09.649 --> 01:36:09.659 align:start position:0%
weren't able to get at that data but
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
what we did understand is that turnover
 
01:36:14.689 --> 01:36:14.699 align:start position:0%
has been a real problem at the Human
 
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission stability has been a
 
01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
real problem at the Human Rights
 
01:36:21.050 --> 01:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
Commission and so representative you
 
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
know Delorenzo looking at basically the
 
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
the breadth of the problems that they
 
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
had there uh said maybe there would be
 
01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
some benefit in actually having a
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
performance audit done of the Human
 
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission simpler to that which
 
01:36:39.229 --> 01:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
had been undertaken uh of the of the
 
01:36:42.910 --> 01:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
parole board and so I did speak with um
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
the director of audits and we have a
 
01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:48.179 align:start position:0%
hearing coming up on November the 10th
 
01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:36:51.770 --> 01:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
um the the board that basically is going
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
to make the decision as to which
 
01:36:56.930 --> 01:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
performance audits are taking up so in
 
01:36:58.610 --> 01:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
addition to you know basically
 
01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
recommending that the legislation go
 
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
forward the three additional
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh that we we are
 
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
looking to to put into the committee
 
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
report are number one
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
um that we push for a performance audit
 
01:37:14.090 --> 01:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
to be done and we will be going up and
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
making the case on November 10th for
 
01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.270 align:start position:0%
making the case on November 10th for
that

01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:19.490 --> 01:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
um also that
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
um the rules of the Human Rights
 
01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
Commission be brought up to date one of
 
01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
the things that came about uh as part of
 
01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
the testimony of the subcommittee is
 
01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
that they have been operating without
 
01:37:34.129 --> 01:37:34.139 align:start position:0%
rules for the last five years so
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
um basically we want to get uh those
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
brought up to date and approved by gel
 
01:37:40.490 --> 01:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
car that's something else we want to
 
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
push for and and also a review
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
um as to what resources are needed
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
basically to allow them to to fulfill
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
their mandate their resources were cut
 
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
back it used to be 10 years ago that um
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
it was a one-year limit to get the
 
01:38:00.649 --> 01:38:00.659 align:start position:0%
probable cause when resources were cut
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
that was moved out to two years but
 
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
they're not even meeting that so those
 
01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
are the three additional recommendations
 
01:38:07.199 --> 01:38:09.250 align:start position:0%
are the three additional recommendations
that

01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:09.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:11.810 --> 01:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee is going to be putting
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
in the committee report but we are going
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
to be recommendation the SB 296 as it
 
01:38:19.610 --> 01:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
was we didn't see any problem with that
 
01:38:21.290 --> 01:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be recommending that
 
01:38:23.209 --> 01:38:23.219 align:start position:0%
for future legislation so we hope you'll
 
01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:32.169 --> 01:38:32.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I think
 
01:38:40.330 --> 01:38:40.340 align:start position:0%
um we shouldn't let this go by without
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
first commending representative McLean
 
01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
who did an incredible amount of work
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
under difficult circumstances
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
um not hurting the cats who are on the
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
committee we were fine but getting the
 
01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:00.229 align:start position:0%
committee we were fine but getting the
information

01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
from those people who had access to uh
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
the data that we needed it was not
 
01:39:12.250 --> 01:39:12.260 align:start position:0%
easily done
 
01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
none of us
 
01:39:21.169 --> 01:39:21.179 align:start position:0%
felt the need to assess blame on anyone
 
01:39:21.179 --> 01:39:22.729 align:start position:0%
felt the need to assess blame on anyone
but

01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:22.739 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
I think I can speak fairly for my
 
01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the subcommittee to say
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
that we were
 
01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
shocked and saddened
 
01:39:36.590 --> 01:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
to realize that there are people in the
 
01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:38.270 align:start position:0%
to realize that there are people in the
state

01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
who because we created a human relations
 
01:39:46.010 --> 01:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
a Human Rights Commission believes that
 
01:39:48.169 --> 01:39:48.179 align:start position:0%
there was someone who would pay
 
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
attention to their concerns
 
01:39:54.290 --> 01:39:54.300 align:start position:0%
and in fact that is not what is
 
01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:56.149 align:start position:0%
and in fact that is not what is
happening

01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:40:01.370 --> 01:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
um the one most shocking example is that
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
there came a day when Representatives
 
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
came in and said they had been able to
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
address the backlog and cut it in half
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
and we were excited about that we
 
01:40:13.250 --> 01:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
thought that was fabulous that was
 
01:40:14.689 --> 01:40:14.699 align:start position:0%
terrific we thought did they get more
 
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
money did they get more staff they had
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
asked for more staff did the governor
 
01:40:22.129 --> 01:40:22.139 align:start position:0%
somehow with all the extra money that's
 
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:25.860 align:start position:0%
come in find a way to help help them no
 
01:40:30.410 --> 01:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
the way they Define cutting the backlog
 
01:40:34.129 --> 01:40:34.139 align:start position:0%
was they took half of the cases and they
 
01:40:37.370 --> 01:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
removed them from the investigators
 
01:40:41.229 --> 01:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
desks and put them in a box someplace
 
01:40:43.850 --> 01:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
literally and figuratively
 
01:40:46.610 --> 01:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
um and so now the investigators only had
 
01:40:49.250 --> 01:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
half as many cases but the people who
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
were depending upon us us the people of
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:40:57.169 --> 01:40:57.179 align:start position:0%
to address their concerns had no help at
 
01:40:58.850 --> 01:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
all and
 
01:40:58.860 --> 01:40:59.530 align:start position:0%
all and
um

01:40:59.530 --> 01:40:59.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:02.570 --> 01:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
uh we all know that
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
people that that
 
01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners and other employees
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
are in difficult position they have to
 
01:41:11.330 --> 01:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
keep a stiff upper look they have to
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
keep a smile on their face they're given
 
01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
x amount of money when they think they
 
01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
need why they're given a amount of staff
 
01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
when they think they need B but they
 
01:41:24.169 --> 01:41:24.179 align:start position:0%
just kind of go on they don't complain
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
and they think they're being
 
01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:29.639 align:start position:0%
good sports and responsible to the
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
people who appointed them
 
01:41:33.530 --> 01:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
but they are responsible to the people
 
01:41:36.649 --> 01:41:36.659 align:start position:0%
of the state and this body is not
 
01:41:38.689 --> 01:41:38.699 align:start position:0%
carrying out their responsibilities so
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
we really have an obligation
 
01:41:45.169 --> 01:41:45.179 align:start position:0%
to try to get the data necessary to
 
01:41:49.570 --> 01:41:49.580 align:start position:0%
change the game and the um performance
 
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
audit route is a
 
01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:54.430 align:start position:0%
audit route is a
a

01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely solid route here where
 
01:42:00.169 --> 01:42:00.179 align:start position:0%
trained professionals will go through
 
01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
this is not a financial audit this is a
 
01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
a performance audit to look at how they
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
are organized and how they might be able
 
01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
to change what they're doing in order to
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of the states so the tone
 
01:42:17.149 --> 01:42:17.159 align:start position:0%
that will go in a written statement
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:20.149 align:start position:0%
will be
um

01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
less emotional
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
as is appropriate but the reality is
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
that we have a problem here and we are
 
01:42:33.290 --> 01:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
obliged to try to address it and so
 
01:42:35.629 --> 01:42:35.639 align:start position:0%
um I I want to end with the way I began
 
01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
which is to thank representative McLean
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
who maintaining an even temper
 
01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:44.330 align:start position:0%
who maintaining an even temper
and

01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:46.070 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
a fair and open-minded approach really
 
01:42:53.090 --> 01:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
helped us through this process so thank
 
01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
I also would just like to add my thanks
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
as well to representative McLean to do a
 
01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
superb job in running the subcommittee
 
01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
my take is a little bit different with
 
01:43:09.530 --> 01:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
regard to the performance audit I think
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
performance audit will be great
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
but in large part
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
the commission is operating uh first of
 
01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:17.709 align:start position:0%
the commission is operating uh first of
all

01:43:17.709 --> 01:43:17.719 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:43:20.689 --> 01:43:20.699 align:start position:0%
just as unbelievable as it is there's a
 
01:43:24.169 --> 01:43:24.179 align:start position:0%
statute that says that when the
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Commission gets a case it
 
01:43:27.890 --> 01:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
needs to complete the case within two
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
years a statute says that right now
 
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
they're completing cases in three years
 
01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
four years
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
five years
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
just totally unacceptable and from my
 
01:43:39.890 --> 01:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
01:43:43.370 --> 01:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
a person who was a litigant and knows
 
01:43:44.209 --> 01:43:44.219 align:start position:0%
that they're going to go the Human
 
01:43:45.649 --> 01:43:45.659 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission should have a
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation that they should
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
be able to get some type of answer
 
01:43:52.010 --> 01:43:52.020 align:start position:0%
within a year it just seems reasonable
 
01:43:54.890 --> 01:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
a year's time but
 
01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
my concern with the prom performance
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
audit and I I think it's a great idea
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
and it'll evaluate it but
 
01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
so much of what the commission does is
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
based upon statutes that we've enacted
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
and put in place with regard to
 
01:44:10.570 --> 01:44:10.580 align:start position:0%
investigators doing probable cause
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
assessments and and so forth and I'm
 
01:44:16.609 --> 01:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
afraid that in the performance audits
 
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
they're going to measure
 
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission against
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
the statutes that we put in place where
 
01:44:25.729 --> 01:44:25.739 align:start position:0%
I think what needs to really change is
 
01:44:28.310 --> 01:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
the statutes that are in place to make
 
01:44:30.050 --> 01:44:30.060 align:start position:0%
it more effective and to make it work
 
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
better and to serve the people of the of
 
01:44:36.590 --> 01:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
the state and that is my uh my only
 
01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:38.149 align:start position:0%
the state and that is my uh my only
qualification

01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
qualification
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
but I do think the performance audit was
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
valuable and hopefully get it done but
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
if it were up to me
 
01:44:47.570 --> 01:44:47.580 align:start position:0%
if I was still going to be here I'd be
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
putting in a bill to change the way
 
01:44:52.490 --> 01:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
probable cause is assessed and the way
 
01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
things are heard
 
01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
frankly you you'd have an expectation
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
that the human right Commissioners are
 
01:45:01.189 --> 01:45:01.199 align:start position:0%
having hearings they don't have any
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
hearings they have three or four
 
01:45:03.649 --> 01:45:03.659 align:start position:0%
hearings a year
 
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
uh if you can believe that just
 
01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
unbelievable anyway uh I'm fully
 
01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.619 --> 01:45:17.930 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative McLean made the motion
 
01:45:22.970 --> 01:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
and it and it was seconded by
 
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative naughter
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
and that is to recommend further
 
01:45:27.719 --> 01:45:29.270 align:start position:0%
and that is to recommend further
legislation

01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:45:31.129 --> 01:45:31.139 align:start position:0%
and I think representative McLean has
 
01:45:31.139 --> 01:45:31.850 align:start position:0%
and I think representative McLean has
already

01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:45:34.729 --> 01:45:34.739 align:start position:0%
circulated the report that he intends to
 
01:45:34.739 --> 01:45:36.530 align:start position:0%
circulated the report that he intends to
file

01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
file
 
01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay would you like to call the roll I
 
01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:48.590 align:start position:0%
okay would you like to call the roll I
would

01:45:48.590 --> 01:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
on the motion to recommend SB 296 for
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%

01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay you voted 18-1 to recommend for
 
01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.179 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 296. Mr chair yes
 
01:46:50.810 --> 01:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
um I promise I won't take long I do want
 
01:46:53.990 --> 01:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
to just take uh one quick minute to
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
respond to your comments almost all of
 
01:46:59.810 --> 01:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
which I agree with but I have had great
 
01:47:02.330 --> 01:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
familiarity over many many years
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
probably too many
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
um with performance Audits and one of
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
the important components of a
 
01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
well-constructed performance audit is a
 
01:47:19.149 --> 01:47:19.159 align:start position:0%
suggestion based on facts data findings
 
01:47:22.850 --> 01:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
rather than on emotions of not only
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
changing rules and regulations and and
 
01:47:29.090 --> 01:47:29.100 align:start position:0%
processes but also changing the rsas
 
01:47:32.450 --> 01:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
with a very specifically says say this
 
01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
RSA has to be changed and um I think you
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
know to get this issue out of the range
 
01:47:41.450 --> 01:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
of violence playing in the background
 
01:47:43.609 --> 01:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
and into a range when some hard
 
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
decisions could be made I think the
 
01:47:51.530 --> 01:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:54.169 --> 01:47:54.179 align:start position:0%
yes I think that
 
01:47:56.209 --> 01:47:56.219 align:start position:0%
about concludes our business today is
 
01:47:59.090 --> 01:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
there anything else yes Mr Mr chair I'd
 
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
like to make a statement yep
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
so uh I think this is going to be the
 
01:48:06.410 --> 01:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
last time that we uh get together so I
 
01:48:08.450 --> 01:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
just want to say it really has been an
 
01:48:10.609 --> 01:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
honor for me to be your your Vice chair
 
01:48:13.850 --> 01:48:13.860 align:start position:0%
I I've never served in in the capacity
 
01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
as a vice chair and I was very very
 
01:48:20.689 --> 01:48:20.699 align:start position:0%
lucky to to have you as chair that you
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
you really LED this Committee in an
 
01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
exemplary manner in in the in a period
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
of increased rank or everywhere
 
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
um the debate here was very very
 
01:48:34.729 --> 01:48:34.739 align:start position:0%
principled but but also very
 
01:48:37.490 --> 01:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
professional and cordial and you know
 
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
that that's getting rare and rarer and
 
01:48:42.410 --> 01:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
when I heard that you were not going to
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
run again for me that was a very hard
 
01:48:46.669 --> 01:48:46.679 align:start position:0%
blow and I'm really going to miss you
 
01:48:48.590 --> 01:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
especially you know coming right before
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
that I had a representative Smith as as
 
01:48:54.890 --> 01:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
a chair so this committee really has
 
01:48:57.770 --> 01:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
been very very blessed and I'm really
 
01:49:00.649 --> 01:49:00.659 align:start position:0%
going to miss you sir been here thank
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you so much so much oh you
 
01:49:05.330 --> 01:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
don't need to do that
 
01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
it's really it was uh it's been my honor
 
01:49:10.370 --> 01:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
to serve uh the committee it's been my
 
01:49:12.050 --> 01:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
honor to serve the state first of all
 
01:49:15.050 --> 01:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
but it's been my honor to be a chair I
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
was so very fortunate to be given uh
 
01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
this opportunity and to work with all of
 
01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:21.709 align:start position:0%
this opportunity and to work with all of
you

01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
you know I the the committee when I look
 
01:49:27.590 --> 01:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
at the other chairs and I look at the
 
01:49:29.689 --> 01:49:29.699 align:start position:0%
other committees and what they've gone
 
01:49:32.689 --> 01:49:32.699 align:start position:0%
through this committee is exemplary in
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
my in my mind in terms of the way that
 
01:49:38.209 --> 01:49:38.219 align:start position:0%
we got business done we got a lot of
 
01:49:40.850 --> 01:49:40.860 align:start position:0%
business done first of all we got a lot
 
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
of business done we did it timely we got
 
01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
it done
 
01:49:48.609 --> 01:49:48.619 align:start position:0%
and we did it without any any Rancor or
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
people really being
 
01:49:54.050 --> 01:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
jerks you know it was
 
01:49:56.450 --> 01:49:56.460 align:start position:0%
it was uh it was real it was really
 
01:49:59.209 --> 01:49:59.219 align:start position:0%
really special a lot of a lot of credit
 
01:50:01.250 --> 01:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
for that goes to representative Smith
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
who is just you know in terms of
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
