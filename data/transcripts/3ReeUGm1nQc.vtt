00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
planning to jump in when he comes back
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
and that's one thing and the other thing
 
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.550 align:start position:0%
and that's one thing and the other thing
is

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
today what we're really doing is just
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
going over the retained bills
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
and making a decision about whether or
 
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
not we should
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation and we're
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
not going into the
 
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:28.720 align:start position:0%
heart of the bills we're discussing them
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
in in a really
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
you know deep or meaningful way we're
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
just going to discuss
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
whether or not we recommend that
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
they have future legislation but
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
even if we say they shouldn't have
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
um people can put in a bill so it
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
very complicated and like
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
after after we talk briefly about the
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
bills i accept a motion to go into
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
no the first bill
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
of six is house bill 306 prohibiting
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
the destruction of sexual assault
 
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
um i would just start off by saying that
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
unless and until we address the statute
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
of limitations
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
issue this would seem to be put in the
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
cart before the horse
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
if there's a statute of limitations on
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
the on the charge itself
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
mandating that the kit be kept
 
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.389 align:start position:0%
mandating that the kit be kept
indefinitely

00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
indefinitely
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to make any sense and puts
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
an undue burden on the police
 
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.790 align:start position:0%
an undue burden on the police
departments

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
departments
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
to store rape kits indefinitely so
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
i think that this one might be a little
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
a little too early
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
well i think what happened uh in the
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
last two years that we've been looking
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
at this is that the department of
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
justice has been
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
doing an audit and we were waiting for
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
the results of that audit
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
and we're going to base our decision on
 
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.150 align:start position:0%
and we're going to base our decision on
that

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
i think the next session people have to
 
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
see if that audit is finished and move
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
there are other issues that would go
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
with that too like having a building to
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
for storage for
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
representative rod do we have a sense of
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
when that audit results will we'll hear
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
those or
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
well no no especially with covid i don't
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know but i i think the next
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
session somebody
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
will want to look into that and pull the
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
information together
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
are we supposed to raise our hand how do
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
we do this i guess if you could
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
raise your hand um virtually um
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
so we can keep track of um an order
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
it should be on the participant list and
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
you should be able to see raise hand
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
feature at the bottom
 
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
so you're recognized
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
thank you i understand listen if it's
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
out if any
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
offense is outside of the statute
 
00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:22.550 align:start position:0%
offense is outside of the statute
limitations

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
the preservation of evidence for that
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what we're doing i i i'm
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
all for
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
storing the evidence for a longer period
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
but there has to be a justification for
 
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:36.949 align:start position:0%
but there has to be a justification for
it

00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
and you know i i was in support of
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
making the statute of limitations
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
for sexual assault cases
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know do not have one but at the same
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
time if it's
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
20 years time barred why would we ever
 
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
exert money
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
into stating that i don't think we need
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
an audit report to tell us that
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
whatever after limitations is it should
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
line up with how long we preserve the
 
00:11:59.120 --> 00:11:59.829 align:start position:0%
line up with how long we preserve the
evidence

00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
at a minimum i think that's it you don't
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
want to be destroying it before
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
the stash limitations that wouldn't make
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
any sense if destruction of evidence
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
if that's counterproductive to what uh
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
courts police and
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh county attorneys do so
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
i think we can make the recommendation
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
that whatever the statute of limitations
 
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
is this is what you know what what they
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
would keep then there's also going to be
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
some digital evidence a lot of this
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
stuff is still stored the original is
 
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
not there but it will be the dna
 
00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
evidence is going to be put
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
put into a database so there are civil
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
cases but at the same time
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
a individual the government of the state
 
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
required to preserve evidence in a civil
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
case that's a private
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
matter being brought privately
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
well the only thing we're deciding today
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
is whether
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
we recommend future legislation we don't
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
need to go into the guts of the
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
bill because you know we don't have
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
that that's not what we're here for and
 
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is sort of half-baked it
 
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.069 align:start position:0%
this bill is sort of half-baked it
hasn't

00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
hasn't
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
come to nobody's come to any conclusion
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
and we don't need to really discuss the
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
the details of the bill because
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
we didn't do anything with the bill and
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
whoever whoever put in the sponsors are
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to want to put
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
pull it back in next next year so our
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
job is to say well we think
 
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
it should have future legislation or it
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
should not
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's too soon to
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
pursue this bill we don't have the
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
storage facility there's a lot of
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
and uh frankly i don't think it's ready
 
00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:43.430 align:start position:0%
and uh frankly i don't think it's ready
for

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
prime time beth can i
 
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
make a clarification about structures or
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
ask a question that might you might be
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
able to clarify
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
okay so we have this bill the audit's
 
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
not back
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
no everybody's uncertain about what the
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
time period is
 
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
so there are two things that can happen
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
to this bill someone can just submit it
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
and it's what's the difference between
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
somebody just submitting it
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
and we coming to the conclusion that
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's suitable
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
that it should be pursued to figure out
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
those details
 
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
does that have some bearing on on the
 
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.389 align:start position:0%
does that have some bearing on on the
bill

00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
in some some way no it has no bearing on
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
some but if a person wanted to put in
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
more legislation
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
they could say criminal justice uh
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
recommended that it
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
have you know future future legislation
 
00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:36.310 align:start position:0%
have you know future future legislation
and

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
that that's all this is just a way of
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
concluding our
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
our session um it has no bearing
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
on the bill it's so it's kind of
 
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.030 align:start position:0%
on the bill it's so it's kind of
changing

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
and indoor it's kind of like an
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
endorsement if
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
of that type of bill or someone puts it
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
in yes
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and represent abroad
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative murphy has her hand up
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
sorry i lost my whole screen um i i just
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
want to say i i understand that this is
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
merely more of a recommendation and
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
really doesn't speak to
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
the bill so much itself as whether or
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
not we think it's worthy of
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
reconsideration or or
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
submit the content is
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
worthy of of maybe a further legislation
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
i would support moving that forward that
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
we support that um you know whether or
 
00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:45.759 align:start position:0%
not it passes whether or not
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
we have the information at a time when
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
the bill is brought forward
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
um would be a whole different story and
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
would be evaluated then but
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
if we're looking at uh uh you know
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
talking about statute of limitations on
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
sexual assault itself
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
then i think this sort of would coincide
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
with that so
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
i would hate to to think we wouldn't
 
00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
recommend something that would
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
um keep evidence when we would be
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
possibly considering um you know
 
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
reconsidering a
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh statute of limitations on the crime
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
so i i would support
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
moving it forward for future
 
00:16:17.759 --> 00:16:19.509 align:start position:0%
moving it forward for future
considerations

00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
considerations
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this uh what
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
we're doing today is really
 
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
not what's deciding to move these
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
particular bills forward the way they
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
are but it's more or less the
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
the concept of these bills so during the
 
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
hearing for this particular bill we did
 
00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.030 align:start position:0%
hearing for this particular bill we did
hear

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
testimony that there are problems uh
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
with storing these materials
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh we also considered a a separate bill
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
a little bit later in the year that
 
00:16:54.189 --> 00:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
would have removed the statute of
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
limitations on sexual assault crimes
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
we couldn't agree whether that should be
 
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.949 align:start position:0%
we couldn't agree whether that should be
a

00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
whether that should be a lifetime
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
removal of whether we should put a
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
number of years on it
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
but it seems pretty clear that
 
00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.350 align:start position:0%
but it seems pretty clear that
conceptually

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
conceptually
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
we would want to save uh these rape kits
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
as uh
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative abbas was saying to line
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
up with uh whatever we decide in the
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
future so
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
conceptually i mean this seems to make
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
sense the devil's in the detail
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
representative murphy that uh it does
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
seem sense
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.190 align:start position:0%
 
forward

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
all right um hearing no further
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
questions or comments uh
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
which is house bill do we make a
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
decision on this or is there a vote
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
after we're finished going over these
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
accept emotion because it's a work
 
00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
session i
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
i remember now okay
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh the second bill is uh no it's not
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
that's not what it is um house bill 306
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
prohibiting oh i just didn't just lift
 
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.230 align:start position:0%
prohibiting oh i just didn't just lift
306.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
306.
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay we're on uh house bill 722
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
and act relative to the retail sale and
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
taxation of marijuana
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh on this bill
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
there's a ton of information here
 
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
scott wallace is not here today is that
 
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.110 align:start position:0%
scott wallace is not here today is that
correct

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
no he's not that's correct
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
apparently some of the major players and
 
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.029 align:start position:0%
apparently some of the major players and
stakeholders

00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh for this bill and the other marijuana
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
bill that were going on
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
were not in were not heard
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
at the hearings and there is a
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
of work and study that have gone on in
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
both these
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
bills and i i don't know i think we
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
probably should
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
think about recommending it for future
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
studies and so much work has already
 
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:11.590 align:start position:0%
studies and so much work has already
been

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
done on them but all the stakeholders
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
have not
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to participate but
 
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.950 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to participate but
um

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
i think the one thing that is always
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
left out
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
is the impact on our youth and i think
 
00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:28.630 align:start position:0%
is the impact on our youth and i think
it's

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
a travesty to to implement a bill
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
like this without looking at the
 
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.350 align:start position:0%
like this without looking at the
implement

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
implement
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.909 --> 00:19:45.919 align:start position:0%
but i think that's a good point and um
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
certainly that should be part of
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
whatever the next
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
legislature decides to do with it
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
and uh representative abbott has his
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
hands up yes
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
you recognize thank you
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
if i recall correctly there was a lot of
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
you know four hb 41 was different much
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
different than this
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
and the real difference was was the
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
taxation side of it so that's not
 
00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
something that our committee
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
apparently supposed to deal with i don't
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
like the punt down the hall
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
but this one involved the sales tax
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
so i guess if you think that's worthy of
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
discussing the sales tax i fundamentally
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that's the way to go and i
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
would say that we
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
can this one doesn't mean we can the
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh legalization of cannabis but
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
this one particularly was not something
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly comprehensive bill and
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
certainly the recommendations for other
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
areas to study in it children or taxes
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
should definitely be considered um so i
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
i would think that
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
the next legislature is going to deal
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana is here to stay it's it's
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
legal in most of new england so um
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
if we can focus on
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
putting in a comprehensive bill in the
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
next session
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
uh i think that somebody will do that so
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
if you're happy with being another
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
massachusetts or another vermont
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
representative roy has his hand up yes
 
00:21:30.149 --> 00:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
you're recognized
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman um i would
 
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.070 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman um i would
just

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
for the record um i
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
i endorsed the further study of this but
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
as far as the
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee goes um
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not marijuana is here to stay
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
it is in fact
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
illegal in the entire united states
 
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.830 align:start position:0%
illegal in the entire united states
federally

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
federally
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
so i i don't want us to send a message
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:57.919 align:start position:0%
flouting federal law but thing it's it's
 
00:21:57.919 --> 00:21:58.870 align:start position:0%
flouting federal law but thing it's it's
legal

00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
um regardless of what we decide to do
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
within the future
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
until it's changed federally it's still
 
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments i'm not
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
saying any other hands up
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
this is hb 1159
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
an act relative to cyber bullying cyber
 
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.149 align:start position:0%
an act relative to cyber bullying cyber
stalking

00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
stalking
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
and doxing of a public servant
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
um i think we'd like to hear from
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
the person most familiar with this
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative muse would you like to
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
yes my my recommendation on this bill
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
would be that we not recommend it
 
00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:53.039 align:start position:0%
uh for additional legislation um i think
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
part of the goal was for us to have a
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
a pretty good discussion about some of
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
the behaviors that take place online
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
um i think that there are real uh uh
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
first amendment issues uh
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
restricting the ability of people in the
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
media to be able to
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh to report on certain things uh
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
we agree with what they report we
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
also have uh state laws
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
that do cover things like criminal
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
threatening um
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
and my recommendation would be that uh
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
that we not recommend this for
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other comments
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%

looks a little shocked but now i
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
how's the weather in san francisco not
 
00:24:05.279 --> 00:24:09.029 align:start position:0%
how's the weather in san francisco not
bad

00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
is anybody else uh have anything to add
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any other hands raised
 
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.390 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any other hands raised
okay

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
moving right along
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
hb 1283 an act relative to
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the online disclosure of
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:30.830 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable
information

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
um representative news you wrote the
 
00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.310 align:start position:0%
um representative news you wrote the
committee

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
report would you like to address this
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
yes i think that that this bill
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
basically falls into the same category
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
as uh
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
as the last one um we heard from people
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh from members of the new hampshire
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
press association during the
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh during the hearing for the bill
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh i think there were concerns about
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh abridging first amendment rights uh
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
to a large extent
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh people seem to be uh
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
you know seem to be uh acting
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
responsibly and
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
i think part of the issue with a bill
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
like this is
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
you have to cut uh you have to cut a
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
very very fine line
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
um to uh you know to avoid
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
you know actual arrangement of people's
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
first amendment rights
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
and and the rights of the media to
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
publish legitimate information
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
i think the privacy question is
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
something that we
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
we always are going to need to keep
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
looking at i think we'll probably
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
also like this again in the future um
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think that this is something
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
that i would support
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
moving forward in the next legislature
 
00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.070 align:start position:0%
moving forward in the next legislature
especially

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
especially
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
knowing everything we're going to be
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
facing in the next legislature so
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh i would not uh not support uh
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
yes uh again i agree with representative
 
00:26:09.919 --> 00:26:10.549 align:start position:0%
yes uh again i agree with representative
muse

00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
muse
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
that's the nice choice now it's shocking
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
well no he makes a good point and i
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you does anybody else have
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
any comments i'm not seeing any more
 
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.830 align:start position:0%
any comments i'm not seeing any more
hands

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
hands
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
good this is i believe our last bill is
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 1663 an act relative to the
 
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:36.870 align:start position:0%
house bill 1663 an act relative to the
legalization

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
and regulation of canada and making
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's like like like the other marijuana
 
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.230 align:start position:0%
it's like like like the other marijuana
bill

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
this is more additional information and
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
ideas about marijuana um does anybody
 
00:26:58.799 --> 00:26:59.110 align:start position:0%
ideas about marijuana um does anybody
have

00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
any thoughts about it like
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
we're basically trying to legalize a
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
federal issue
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
and you know i understand the the belief
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
that we ought to do this because
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
there are other states that do it
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
everybody's doing it why don't we do it
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
um i would just add that uh
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
going forward next year it looks like
 
00:27:39.909 --> 00:27:39.919 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have a huge hole in the
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
state budget
 
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh we're gonna need to get creative uh
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
to filling that hole um so far it
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like we're going to be able
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
to fill it
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
with any money coming from the federal
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
government and some of the projections
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
that i've seen
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
are pretty terrifying so in the last
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
section we
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
legalized sports betting we've got some
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
revenue coming in there
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
this is an area that i think we need to
 
00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.870 align:start position:0%
this is an area that i think we need to
seriously

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
seriously look at and when it comes to
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
federal legislation
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
the federal legislation could very well
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
catch up to this
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
during our next session so to have
 
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
something like this in part
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
in progress given the fiscal condition
 
00:28:21.269 --> 00:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
of the state uh and given
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
what could happen at the federal level
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
to me seems to be a pretty crude
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
thing to do i i would point out that
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
back in 2010
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
we were facing an 800 million dollar
 
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.870 align:start position:0%
we were facing an 800 million dollar
budget

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
higher budget than we had money for and
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature found a way to get
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
around that
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
and we cut mental health we cut
 
00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.710 align:start position:0%
and we cut mental health we cut
education

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh we basically cut almost totally
 
00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.510 align:start position:0%
uh we basically cut almost totally
indiscriminately

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
indiscriminately
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh like recognizing the fact that we are
 
00:28:53.909 --> 00:28:53.919 align:start position:0%
gonna have to make some cuts and i think
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
those are gonna be hard on everybody
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
um whatever we can do to bring uh
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
new revenue into the state um in a way
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
that um you know as much as we possibly
 
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:05.990 align:start position:0%
that um you know as much as we possibly
can

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know protects kids and protects
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
minors and protects people who shouldn't
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
have access to this stuff i think we
 
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
need to be doing it this is
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
this is an adult this is a thing that i
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
think adults in this state
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
have been advocating for years
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's something that other states do and
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
for us to keep
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
burying our heads in the sand uh when
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
every other state around us
 
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
has a law like this doesn't seem to make
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
a huge amount of sense
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
so again we're not here to debate the
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
merits of it but
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
and representative looks like
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
representatives welsh newman and abbess
 
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
have their hands raised
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh an area where i disagree with
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
representative news
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
i think that in the when you start
 
00:30:04.149 --> 00:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
collecting revenue from a source
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
like marijuana which is going to affect
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
all our youth
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
and and many of our other citizens one
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
way or another
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
i just don't think it's a good thing to
 
00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
do and i i
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
have supported the marijuana laws that
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
i don't support making an industry
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
out of it thank you representative muse
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
i mean no was that representative um
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
because representatives newman
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
and then representative abbas okay
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
you're recognized yeah i just have a
 
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
comment it's not on this bill i
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
i had another bill on our list 1586 i
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
just wonder if that's going to come up
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
next and i'll stop
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you we're only doing four if i
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
remember right i believe 1586 is on that
 
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:57.509 align:start position:0%
remember right i believe 1586 is on that
list

00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.669 --> 00:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
i think it was on a list that i saw
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
previously i don't know whether we're
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
going to do that today or not just
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring it to your attention
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
so when when we have a moment i really
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
need to back up
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
because i couldn't find the sheet that
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
i got yesterday and i just realized that
 
00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
in the work session
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
i actually have to put if we're
 
00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
recommending future or not
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
and then also the person is
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
there's uh the first person to move that
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation and a second person and a
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
vote now that's the work session
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
and exactly i know i know what you're
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
going to say because i said the same
 
00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:39.909 align:start position:0%
going to say because i said the same
thing

00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
the execution executive session
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
basically says the same thing but i'm
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
not sure why they sent me
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
both sheets look the same
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
well i i think we could have done the
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
executive session at the same time but
 
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.070 align:start position:0%
executive session at the same time but
we

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
just decided not to and so that would be
 
00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.389 align:start position:0%
just decided not to and so that would be
um

00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
that will happen after after this
 
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:01.830 align:start position:0%
that will happen after after this
session

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
okay and then uh that won't work
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
there'll only be uh one um
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
one uh committee
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
meeting there won't be a majority
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
minority report they'll just be the
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
majority report
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
and whoever makes that motion
 
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
should get that to us as soon as
 
00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.389 align:start position:0%
should get that to us as soon as
possible

00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
training okay so are we finished with
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
it looks like um representative abbott
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
also has his hand raised okay
 
00:32:31.679 --> 00:32:35.669 align:start position:0%
also has his hand raised okay
representative

00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you you're recognized so
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
just again we're not going to get into
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
the merits of this one but
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
i agree that there are going to be some
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
revenue shortfalls
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
i thought that this one particularly
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
involved canada's being sold out of the
 
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.230 align:start position:0%
involved canada's being sold out of the
state

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
liquor stores or in the same fashion
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
so when i think what we want to do is
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
definitely put forward some the idea
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
that we want to talk about if we're
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
legalize cannabis even something like
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
myself who's opposed it i always thought
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
this was the best revenue option for the
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
state so i think that this
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
as a state we should put that forward to
 
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
study that if we're going to do it how
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
do we do it and
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
how do we maximize the state revenue
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else not saying then
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
you got their hands raised
 
00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:35.110 align:start position:0%
you got their hands raised
okay

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
and representative rob did you want to
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
do the work session for house bill 1586
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%
yes let's we'll move on to house bill
 
00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:44.070 align:start position:0%
yes let's we'll move on to house bill
1586

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
1586
 
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
relative to the statute of limitations
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
for sexual assault
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't we never got to a
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
point where we decided that um
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
there would be no statute of limitations
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
or we would increase it
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
so it's my feeling is that this is
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
something that we should
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
recommend for legislation next year it's
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
a continuation of the work that's been
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
done this
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
term what did the study can we come up
 
00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:21.430 align:start position:0%
term what did the study can we come up
with

00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry what did the funding committee
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
well if we put it into um interim study
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
but we
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
didn't study it because of the covet so
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
it probably needs further work with the
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
next session
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
okay and representatives murphy and
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
muse have their hands raised okay
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative murphy
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
oh thank you madam chair i absolutely
 
00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:50.389 align:start position:0%
oh thank you madam chair i absolutely
support

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
moving this legislation forward i think
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's very important
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
um to the many victims of sexual assault
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
a statute of limitations deprives them
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
of of um
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know given what we know of uh memory
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
and uh situational uh difficulties that
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
that victims have
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
um i absolutely think that that this is
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
a really important legislation it should
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
definitely be recommended to go forward
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
i would absolutely support that
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you who else had their hand up
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
news thank you you recognized
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
something that the county attorneys were
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
also very supportive of i think we had
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
three of them who actually showed up at
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
a public hearing which is i think the
 
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:35.430 align:start position:0%
a public hearing which is i think the
most

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
i think i've ever seen show up at any
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
so um i i think there's support
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh for this in the in the law
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement community and one of the
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
things that they told us that that
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
really stuck with me
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
was that um even though uh you know
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
things can happen to evidence and
 
00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.190 align:start position:0%
things can happen to evidence and
witnesses

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
witnesses
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
can pass away and things like that
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
in the end for them to be able to
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
prosecute one of these cases they still
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
have to be able to make a case
 
00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the statute of
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
limitations is
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
i think during our debate we got a
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
little bit wrapped around the axle
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
around should it
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
should it be unlimited or should we try
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
to put
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
a 15-year cap or 20-year 25-year cap and
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
i think those were some of the things
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
we were going to try to study but
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
i think definitely in the next session
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
of the legislature
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
doing something with this should should
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
be a priority for the reasons that
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative murphy
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
though articulately stated
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
just a few minutes ago
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
any other comments thank you uh
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative abbas has his hand up
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized thank
 
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.750 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized thank
you

00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
representative murphy and representative
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
muse took all the good material but
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
i agree with what they have to say and i
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
i just want
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know for what we recommend i mean
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
did we just give a thumbs up thumbs down
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
the biggest opposition we had this bill
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
had was
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
you know he said she said 40 years later
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
and i get that
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
and we could always consider when
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
there's physical evidence available
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
if or if it's stored electronically that
 
00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter how old it is
 
00:37:23.589 --> 00:37:23.599 align:start position:0%
i mean the reason why you have sol is
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
when evidence and witnesses go
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
disappeared pass away or evidently go
 
00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:28.950 align:start position:0%
disappeared pass away or evidently go
stale

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
stale
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
but i think we can and the digital age
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
that we're in that's not
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
as much of a problem it is it was
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anybody else who'd
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
like to comment on this
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
not seeing any other hands raised okay
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
i think that concludes our work session
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
um so i would entertain a motion to go
 
00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:55.910 align:start position:0%
um so i would entertain a motion to go
into

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
you'd have to vote on that motion as
 
00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:16.550 align:start position:0%
you'd have to vote on that motion as
well

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
um am i seconding the motion i seconded
 
00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:20.870 align:start position:0%
um am i seconding the motion i seconded
it

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
but then the first one was welch
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
yes correct okay yeah
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
and representative rudd um i understand
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
that you'd have to vote on that to go
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
into the executive session as well
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
yes or you could declare that you're
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
going to executive session
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to i'm going to take up let's
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
take up executive session i think it's
 
00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.109 align:start position:0%
take up executive session i think it's
been

00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
yes yes so we can then move into
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
i have a question uh are there any
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
is anybody see the public on on the
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
line at this time and do they have
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.589 --> 00:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
an executive session the public is not
 
00:39:13.599 --> 00:39:14.069 align:start position:0%
an executive session the public is not
invited

00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
invited
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
too prior to this i
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
but i'm assuming they had no comment or
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
well no nobody raised their hand right
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
that's not true it looks like we um have
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
someone in attendees that does have
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
well now we've already made a and
 
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
seconded um motion to go into executive
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
session so how does that work
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
yeah we're already in the executive
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
session that we have in order to take
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
is it since we're in the executive
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
session then all right
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
i have a question we're in the voting
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
mode and it's
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to do anything unless we
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
finish what was started we got a motion
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
and a second
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
and we should vote yeah and that that's
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
the correct representative well she
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
would need to vote on that motion
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
to go into executive session we need a
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
roll call
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
we actually already did but we you're
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
right we do need a roll call
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
for everything sorry and representative
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
looks like representatives newman and
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
abbott have their hand raised as well
