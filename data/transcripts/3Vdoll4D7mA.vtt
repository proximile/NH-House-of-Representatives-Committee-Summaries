00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 align:start position:0%
all right it's uh it's past one o'clock
 
00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 align:start position:0%
uh 104 and uh we are scheduled to do a
 
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
division three orientation I'm sorry I'm
 
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
late I was talking to the speaker about
 
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
something vastly important I got an
 
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
update on our room
 
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.170 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
yeah so

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
um so I I have a little bit of an agenda
 
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
I want to talk about and I I know that
 
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple is probably come prepared to
 
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
give us an education so we'll start with
 
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
him and we'll do some uh some odds and
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
ends at the end
 
00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
but for the division three folks we have
 
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
both extreme experience and extreme lack
 
00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
of experience so any question anybody
 
00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
wants to answer ask we probably have
 
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
somebody here who can answer it so
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
um so just think of this as a kind of an
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
open Forum an open opportunities for us
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
any uh questions or concerns you may
 
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
have Mr Ripple do you want to give us a
 
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 align:start position:0%
so I guess first of all uh for the new
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
members my name is Kevin Ripple and I've
 
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
been with the LBA
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
I started with the audit division in
 
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
2007 and I've been with the budget
 
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
division since 2013 and division three
 
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
specifically since 2016 2017 so a couple
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
budgets worth of experience there
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and your Phil feel free to contact me
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
at any time phone email stop by my
 
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
office I can tell you where that is and
 
00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 align:start position:0%
I'll be glad to help
 
00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.510 align:start position:0%
I'll be glad to help
so

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
typically for these division
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
orientations we start off with sort of
 
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 align:start position:0%
an overview of
 
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
in the case of the other divisions the
 
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
various agencies that you oversee and in
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
the case of division three the various
 
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
divisions within HHS and normally we
 
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
would go over the budgets for those
 
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
divisions some of the big issue areas
 
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
Etc but
 
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
I talked about this with some of my
 
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
co-workers beforehand and typically what
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
we find is especially after the two hour
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
morning presentation people people's
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
eyes tend to glaze right over a little
 
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
bit so we're going to skip that this
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
year and I think I'm just going to talk
 
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
briefly about the process for division
 
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
three and again for those of you who've
 
00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
been on the committee before there's
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
nothing new here
 
00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:31.909 align:start position:0%
nothing new here
um

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 align:start position:0%
but I'll just go through it for the sake
 
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
typically the um committee starts its
 
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
work in Earnest or the division starts
 
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
its work in Earnest on February 15th
 
00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 align:start position:0%
when the governor's budget comes out
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
this time we're going to start things
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
off a little bit earlier than that at
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
representative Edward's suggestion as
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
you may have seen in your email Janet
 
00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 align:start position:0%
scheduled some division meetings on
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
January 23rd February 1st and February
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
3rd and on those days HHS is going to
 
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
come in and talk about selected issue
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
areas so on the 23rd they're going to
 
00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:05.539 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
I.T systems and priorities and I believe
 
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
they're going to be joined by the
 
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
Information Technology for that
 
00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:14.270 align:start position:0%
Information Technology for that
presentation

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
and then for the subsequent uh dates
 
00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
they'll be talking about in no
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
particular order
 
00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:25.099 align:start position:0%
Manpower and Staffing the status of
 
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
mobile Behavioral Health
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
the status of operations at Hampstead
 
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire hospital
 
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
the status of operations and contingency
 
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
plans for Glencliff home
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
they'll be talking about public health
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
they will be talking about performance
 
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
metrics and how those are conducted
 
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
throughout the department
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
and they'll be talking about any ideas
 
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
they have for how to pay for employee
 
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
pay raises and or hiring incentives
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
so I think you have a sort of a full
 
00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
schedule of some major issue areas that
 
00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
HHS will become coming in and talking
 
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:04.259 align:start position:0%
about so that'll give you some
 
00:08:06.529 --> 00:08:06.539 align:start position:0%
some good ideas for where to focus once
 
00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:08.759 align:start position:0%
the budget process gets going in Earnest
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
yes so are we going to be able to pull
 
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
Meredith tell us before the 15th of
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
February or were we thinking that she
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
would come have to come after the
 
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
governor's budget so I conveyed that
 
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
request to Nathan and my request was
 
00:08:25.249 --> 00:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
that she'd be
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
he'll be here
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
she'll be here on either the first or
 
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
the third okay so so to talk a little
 
00:08:35.209 --> 00:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
bit about uh what Mr Ripple just went
 
00:08:38.449 --> 00:08:38.459 align:start position:0%
over is last year or two years ago
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
rather was the my first term in division
 
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
three and one of the first things Mr
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
Ripple asked me is okay how would you
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
like to sequence the budget
 
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
presentations nice and I said I have no
 
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
idea you just do them in whatever way
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
make sense so so now having gone through
 
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
it I was left with the feeling that uh I
 
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
had allowed a lot of wasted time between
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the term and the 15th
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
of February and so what this is really
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
an attempt to do is to bring some issues
 
00:09:12.839 --> 00:09:13.970 align:start position:0%
an attempt to do is to bring some issues
forward

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
with the disclaimer and with the request
 
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:19.100 align:start position:0%
for us not to really focus on the money
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
let's talk about the programmatics let's
 
00:09:24.769 --> 00:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
talk about the issues uh let's talk
 
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
about the trends the concerns you know
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
that that sort of thing and also while
 
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:33.620 align:start position:0%
we're talking on these specific uh
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
strategic topic areas for lack of
 
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
another term
 
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
as you get questions that you would have
 
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:43.740 align:start position:0%
liked to have answered you know you can
 
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
either just ask them and say when you
 
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
come back during the budget phase you
 
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
know bring some answers to the following
 
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
questions I I don't think we should
 
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:53.220 align:start position:0%
expect that they're going to have
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
numbers or dollar numbers for us but I
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
do think they ought to be able to talk
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
about the programmatics because you know
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
they're they're on a trajectory they've
 
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
been on for years so so the antenna is
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
to to bring some of that orientation to
 
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
the department forward and and we'll
 
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
still do the hardcore number issues
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
later but but this is meant to be a
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
chance for you to ask questions of them
 
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
so that they come prepared after the
 
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
15th of February yes sir
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
no I
 
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
I'm done
 
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
just a quick question can you request
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
other presenters that they provide the
 
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
electronic versions of their documents a
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:43.019 align:start position:0%
okay now so some of the outlines of what
 
00:10:44.569 --> 00:10:44.579 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask in the Strategic
 
00:10:44.579 --> 00:10:46.850 align:start position:0%
we're going to ask in the Strategic
topics

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
topics
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
um uh Mr Ripple and I've talked about
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
them uh representative erf did some
 
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
heavy lifting on what those topics uh
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
some questions for those topics back in
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
October and sent them to miss Ripple
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
back then so so for the to bring me up
 
00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:06.260 align:start position:0%
to speed
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
I I'm thinking of what representative
 
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
erf was asking of the Departments which
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
was more detailed than what I've been
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
asking and I'm just curious how you see
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
us aligned in terms of our one face to
 
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm not really sure I conveyed
 
00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:28.019 align:start position:0%
that request uh that representative erf
 
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
had made and I also conveyed your
 
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
request that the department at least
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
include the um schedule two forms that
 
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
can be found in the agency budget
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
request to the extent that they apply to
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget so I
 
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
think at a minimum their presentations
 
00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:44.339 align:start position:0%
will contain that
 
00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:47.459 align:start position:0%
super and then representative nordgren
 
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
you had sent me an email saying that you
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
had some specific issues that you wanted
 
00:11:55.329 --> 00:11:55.339 align:start position:0%
to address with the I think uh
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
glencliffe the sununu center and
 
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire hospital were the
 
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
three the areas that you were
 
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
and I think I think we are we being
 
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
broadcast so we should be using the
 
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.670 align:start position:0%
broadcast so we should be using the
microphone

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
um so and I think Phil Brook was the
 
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.230 align:start position:0%
um so and I think Phil Brook was the
question

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.269 align:start position:0%
question
what's happening

00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
what's happening
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
I I think we can ask about Phil Brook I
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
think uh that is to me that's new I I
 
00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019 align:start position:0%
must have dropped the ball I don't
 
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
remember asking about Phil Brook but I
 
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
don't think so but we can ask the
 
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
department to add it to the
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
presentations on February 1st and 3rd if
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
you like yeah okay thank you
 
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
all right and so sorry among the other
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
among the areas that representative
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
Nordman had asked about I think the only
 
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:49.740 align:start position:0%
other one that wouldn't be covered by
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
the Department's presentations is the
 
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:52.860 align:start position:0%
sununa center
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
um and it's my understanding we can
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
certainly ask them to come in and talk
 
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
about that too but it's my understanding
 
00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
that there's a special committee that's
 
00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
addressing that as well so I'm not sure
 
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
if he wanted that to be taken up in
 
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
division three oh okay so
 
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
the sununu center because per statute it
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
needs to close on one March uh I I've
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
been working very closely uh as have
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
others like representative Lynn
 
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:20.700 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson to uh to prepare
 
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
a bill for the Senate to Fast Track to
 
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
get it over here and as I was talking
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
the speaker one of the things we talked
 
00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:29.579 align:start position:0%
about was how we were going to Fast
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
Track uh the new bill through the house
 
00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I I probably know as much
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
about that topic as the department at
 
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
this point because the ball is really in
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
the legislators legislature's Court to
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
get something passed and um and so just
 
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:52.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
for for those of you who participated in
 
00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:58.139 align:start position:0%
the debate last year
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
you'll remember that the committee
 
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
conference produced a sununu bill
 
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
we did not end up agreeing to the sununu
 
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
bill primarily because the issue of how
 
00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:12.839 align:start position:0%
big the thing should be there was a
 
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
strong advocacy for no more than six
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
there was another advocacy for minimum
 
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
of 12 that could be expanded to 18
 
00:14:26.569 --> 00:14:26.579 align:start position:0%
should there be an exigent need for it
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
um and that caused the thing to break
 
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.870 align:start position:0%
um and that caused the thing to break
down

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
at the same time when the bill was in
 
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959 align:start position:0%
division three I had prepared an
 
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
amendment that had a number of smaller
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
points like Leverage co-location
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
leverage shared services what should
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
happen to the property at once um the
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
the residents were moved out
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
a number of topics the Senate last week
 
00:14:58.009 --> 00:14:58.019 align:start position:0%
had a joint HHS and Judiciary Committee
 
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
hearing were they considered sb1 Sharon
 
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
Carson's bill I brought in the remnants
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
of what I had prepared back in May or
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
June for the sununa bill that just never
 
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
got considered never I couldn't get it
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
so so they've amended the bill to where
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
I'm really very happy with it
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
they're going to vote on it in the
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
Senate tomorrow I think it's going to
 
00:15:29.629 --> 00:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
pass then it's going to go to Senate
 
00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:33.860 align:start position:0%
Finance Senate Finance Senators Abbas
 
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
and Birdsall have some financial and
 
00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:39.899 align:start position:0%
other issues with it so they may want to
 
00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:42.839 align:start position:0%
amend it yet again so but but the Senate
 
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
knows they've got to pass or something
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
and get it to us quickly
 
00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:49.740 align:start position:0%
once we get it it'll be assigned to
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
Children and Family Law
 
00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:56.339 align:start position:0%
um the speaker and and representing
 
00:15:57.889 --> 00:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
Pearson's the chair of that so I'm
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
talking to him but but what the intent
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
is is to get the right people from
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
division three to sit in with children
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
and family law so that the committee
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
will take one bite at the Senate bill
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
get it to the floor and pass it if we
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
pass with the Senate passes
 
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:20.459 align:start position:0%
then it's ready for the Governor's
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
signature and we can beat the one March
 
00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.889 align:start position:0%
signature and we can beat the one March
deadline

00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
deadline
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
that's probably way more answer than you
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
wanted but do is is that does that
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
address your concerns about where the
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
I wanted an update on where we were with
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
the process knowing that we had the
 
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
merch first deadline and everything yep
 
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
um you're welcome
 
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
so do you remember where you were at I
 
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
do yes
 
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.110 align:start position:0%
do yes
so

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:56.220 align:start position:0%
you'll have those presentations at the
 
00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
end of January early February and then
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
February 15th or thereabouts the
 
00:17:02.569 --> 00:17:02.579 align:start position:0%
governor's budget will come out and the
 
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
trailer Bill House Bill 2 should come
 
00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:06.059 align:start position:0%
out at the same time in the past there's
 
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:08.100 align:start position:0%
been a couple weeks lag getting House
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 out of the governor's office but
 
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
in the in-house Bill 2 from a couple
 
00:17:15.049 --> 00:17:15.059 align:start position:0%
years ago there was a section requiring
 
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
that it also come out on February 15th
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
so you should get that bill to work on
 
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
right after the governor's budget comes
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
out the governor will present to the
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
full finance committee along with side
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
his budget director
 
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
and then usually in the week that
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
follows certain agencies including house
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
and Health and Human Services will come
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
in and give a presentation to the full
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
committee and then the division's work
 
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
will begin in Earnest
 
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
um so you've probably taken a look at
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
the calendar
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
and you see that the divisions have
 
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
about five weeks after the governor's
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
budget comes out to complete their work
 
00:17:54.169 --> 00:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
it might look like a little bit longer
 
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
it might look like six weeks but the LBA
 
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
needs time
 
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
once you've made your decisions to make
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
the changes in the state's budget system
 
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
and put together what we call a detailed
 
00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:07.100 align:start position:0%
change sheet and the other information
 
00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:09.059 align:start position:0%
that you will need and that
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards specifically will
 
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
need to present on the division's
 
00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the full finance
 
00:18:15.059 --> 00:18:16.370 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the full finance
committee

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
so that's the long way of saying you've
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
got about five weeks to complete your
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
work so so I had heard Mr Kane say that
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
our division three drop dead date is 23
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
March is that is that what you heard is
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
that the the date we're going to
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
consider where division three should
 
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
have its work done I don't work on the
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
calendar in front of me but that sounds
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
about right
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
I'll verify with him but that sounds
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.549 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
speaking of House Bill 2 uh one thing
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to mention again for the
 
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
newer members is that
 
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
although House Bill one is a lot of work
 
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
for division three HHS comprises about
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
43 percent of the Statewide budget House
 
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 is a little bit less work out of
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
470 sections in the last trailer Bill
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
HHS comprised about 30 of them so at
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
least in that respect not to minimize
 
00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
the the importance of House Bill 2 and
 
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
some of the sections in it but at least
 
00:19:15.289 --> 00:19:15.299 align:start position:0%
in that respect your workload will be a
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
little bit lighter than some of the
 
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
you will also as the budget process goes
 
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
along have bills to vote out a division
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
last I checked there were seven bills in
 
00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
the full finance committee only one of
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
which is in division three which is your
 
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
sununu Center bill
 
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
but there will definitely be more coming
 
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
so that brings me to what can you expect
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
of me and what can you expect at the LBA
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
office more generally hold that thought
 
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
sure let's talk about
 
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
um two things that I I learned last term
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
and this is specifically for the newer
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
people here and if I'm saying it wrong
 
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
I'd like the more experienced people to
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
correct or extend or revise my remarks
 
00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:05.930 align:start position:0%
correct or extend or revise my remarks
but

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:06.970 align:start position:0%
but
um

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:06.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
hb2 is
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
really very critical and what I didn't
 
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
know we should do and what I'm thinking
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be done is we need to
 
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
um I need to make a more concerted
 
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
effort to bring hb2 items to the
 
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
division early then we had them brought
 
00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419 align:start position:0%
so that we can discuss them and debate
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
them and probably if there's an area
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
where we're going to have the most
 
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
disagreement it could be over
 
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
potentially hb2 items so so because that
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
could potentially be a source of
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
contention it's my intention to try to
 
00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:51.650 align:start position:0%
contention it's my intention to try to
accelerate

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
accelerate
 
00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:54.419 align:start position:0%
um at least bring forward you know the
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
most critical hb2 items so that we have
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for everyone to discuss
 
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:02.220 align:start position:0%
it State their positions think about it
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
and and to work with Mr Ripple to create
 
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
amendments now are are you going to talk
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
about your firewall policy
 
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
on how you know okay so let me see what
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
I think your firewall policy is and then
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
you can tell me if I'm right or wrong Mr
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
Ripple works for all of us okay to the
 
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
extent that
 
00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
um he gets overwhelmed that's kind of my
 
00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
responsibility to try to you know set
 
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
priorities if need be
 
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
um but if you have things you want him
 
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
to research
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
um uh if you want amendments you want
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
him to craft uh that's none of my
 
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.190 align:start position:0%
him to craft uh that's none of my
business

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's strictly between you and Mr
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
Ripple until you're you choose when and
 
00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
how to present your information
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
the one thing I would ask though is if
 
00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
you know that you're asking him for
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
something that's
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to want to hear in public
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
hearing you know just kind of give me
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
the courtesy to know so that I can
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
prepare my head for you know what we're
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
going to do for work that day I don't I
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't need to get into into much other
 
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.130 align:start position:0%
don't need to get into into much other
than

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
you know uh representative nordgren
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
might say hey by the way you know we
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
have an amendment we want to discuss can
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
we schedule when we're going to discuss
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
it you know I I don't even particularly
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
need to know the details beyond that but
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
so so Mr Ripple is um
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
was it Austria that was the neutral
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
country uh he he sort of uh always
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
neutral always secure you can always
 
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
talk to him and in the two years that
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
I've worked with him I've never even got
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
a hint that there was leakage of
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
information that wasn't appropriate so
 
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.130 align:start position:0%
information that wasn't appropriate so
um

00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
did I say anything wrong you want to say
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
any more oh I don't think so uh that's
 
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
very true yep any any request that you
 
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
make of me anything that you come to me
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
with I'll keep it keep it between us and
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
I won't share it unless less requested
 
00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:13.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
Kevin I wondered if you'll be preparing
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
if the LBA will be preparing the
 
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
document that you've prepared for us in
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
the past where you take House Bill 2 and
 
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
you divide it up among the three
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
divisions and then each division
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
concentrates on their parts of House
 
00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
Bill too yes we will do that so uh in
 
00:23:39.289 --> 00:23:39.299 align:start position:0%
the days or the week or so after House
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 comes out the sections will be
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
divided up by division and you'll get a
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
chance to
 
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
look at the ones that are allocated to
 
00:23:48.169 --> 00:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
division three and then shortly
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
thereafter John Williams most likely
 
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
will come in from HHS and talk about
 
00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
those sections and then any requests
 
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
that he or the department has that were
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
left out of the governor's version of
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.789 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
um

00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:01.799 --> 00:24:04.789 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
in terms of House Bill 2 as well as the
 
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
operating budget and any other bills
 
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
that come your way typically for
 
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
amendments you would go through OLS
 
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
but in this case you're welcome and in
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
fact it's probably easier for all
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
involved if you bring Amendment ideas to
 
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
me and then I can work on them and
 
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
complete them and forward them to OLS as
 
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
necessary so in the case of house bill
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
one anything numbers related typically
 
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't even go through OLS I'll prepare
 
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.090 align:start position:0%
doesn't even go through OLS I'll prepare
a

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
a spreadsheet or a document that
 
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
includes the changes that you would like
 
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
to make and that will be handed out to
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
the full committee to vote on in the
 
00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
case of host Bill 2 and other bills
 
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
they will be formal amendments that have
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
gone through OLS
 
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
um but I find it works a little bit
 
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
better if if they all start with me as
 
00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
long as you're willing to do that if
 
00:24:59.690 --> 00:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
you'd rather go to OLS first you're
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome to do that instead
 
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.450 align:start position:0%
certainly welcome to do that instead
um

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.890 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:09.409 --> 00:25:09.419 align:start position:0%
as you suggested representative Edwards
 
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
I think we should get started on House
 
00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:12.539 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 early as soon as it comes to the
 
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
division and probably have a couple
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
different run-throughs over the next few
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
weeks so you'll hear about amendments
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
that HHS would like you to make and
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
you'll have your own ideas for
 
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
amendments and you might even have ideas
 
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
from other bills that you would like to
 
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
incorporate into house bill too so we
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
can talk about that and prepare
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
amendments as necessary as we go along
 
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.750 align:start position:0%
amendments as necessary as we go along
um

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
so to the extent
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
that the department has hb2 items that
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
they are comfortable talking about
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
before the 15th of February I'm fine
 
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
with that is I think that's what you
 
00:25:51.649 --> 00:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
were implying is that if if they're
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
ready early we can start early uh well
 
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299 align:start position:0%
the that makes sense I'm not sure
 
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
they'll be ready early though because
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
they won't necessarily know before the
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
15th what the governor put in and what
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
the governor left out
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
which is true not only of the trailer
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
bill it's true of house bill one as well
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:13.930 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:13.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
amendments is one of the things that I
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
can do for you I can also conduct
 
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
research as requested if there's
 
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
something you'd rather come to the LBA
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
for instead of the department I'd
 
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
certainly be happy to do that and
 
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:27.590 align:start position:0%
certainly be happy to do that and
um

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
I'll be tracking all of this information
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
as we go along so I'll be tracking your
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
requests of the department I'll be
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
tracking your requests of me I'll be
 
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
tracking the status of House Bill 2
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
sections that you've addressed and that
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
you haven't addressed and I'll be
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
tracking the areas of the budget that
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
you've addressed and have an address and
 
00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
I'll provide you regular updates SC or
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
status as we go along so the committee
 
00:26:51.649 --> 00:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
will never should never really be lost
 
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
as to where you're at in the workload
 
00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
and what you have left to do
 
00:27:00.409 --> 00:27:00.419 align:start position:0%
um and then once the division finalizes
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
its budget work in late March I and the
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
other analysts will get together
 
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
will prepare a packet of House Bill 2
 
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
amendments that have been adopted by the
 
00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:12.299 align:start position:0%
division we'll prepare a detailed change
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
sheet which shows line by line all the
 
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
budgetary changes that the division
 
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
recommends to the full committee and
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
then we'll put those together into a
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
packet that you representative Edwards
 
00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
will present to the full committee to
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
vote on in early April
 
00:27:27.539 --> 00:27:29.029 align:start position:0%
vote on in early April
so

00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's actually about all that I had
 
00:27:33.409 --> 00:27:33.419 align:start position:0%
planned on talking about today is there
 
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
anything that I missed or anything else
 
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
that you want to hear from
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
I I have I have some sort of
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
supplemental chair comments on on this
 
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.169 align:start position:0%
supplemental chair comments on on this
um

00:27:44.169 --> 00:27:44.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
earlier today we we had a conversation
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
with Mr Kane about lapsing versus
 
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing and
 
00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
um and so I don't think we need to do
 
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
that again just just for the committee
 
00:27:59.330 --> 00:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
it's something we ought to keep an eye
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
on if the the Department's going to ask
 
00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
us to change status from lapsing to
 
00:28:06.769 --> 00:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing that that's going to be
 
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
worth a discussion
 
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
um I think as we go through this process
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
um you you probably know that Ways and
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
Means comes up with the initial Revenue
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
estimates and we can't by law spend more
 
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
money than we're told that is available
 
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
so Ways and Means has to produce
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
something that has to be get passed by
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
the house and then that makes available
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
all of the dollars for the division to
 
00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.730 align:start position:0%
all of the dollars for the division to
spend

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:36.740 align:start position:0%
spend
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
as sort of a ceiling particularly with
 
00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:45.299 align:start position:0%
last year I was expecting the chair of
 
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
Finance to say okay we have you know
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
three billion dollars or whatever the
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
number is you know division uh three you
 
00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
got 51 percent of it you know division
 
00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
one you got some other percent I
 
00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
expected an initial breakdown
 
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
to start our process we didn't get that
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
and I don't know I don't think we're
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
going to get that again maybe maybe the
 
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
vice chair could could speak to this if
 
00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know anything about it but but the
 
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
way it ended up working last time
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
was that we independently did our work
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
and then we went back into the kind of
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
the finance committee of the whole and
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's when we started talking about you
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
know whether or not there was room at
 
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
the end or somebody had to start
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
thinking about cutting so so I I think
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
the first time through we should try to
 
00:29:36.049 --> 00:29:36.059 align:start position:0%
be you know rational and reasonable
 
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
about what we're doing and then we we
 
00:29:40.909 --> 00:29:40.919 align:start position:0%
may have to do some adjustments as we go
 
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:43.220 align:start position:0%
through that process
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
there are the footnotes those got
 
00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier I I was naive about
 
00:29:51.409 --> 00:29:51.419 align:start position:0%
how important it was to have a real
 
00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:54.299 align:start position:0%
discussion about the footnotes and so so
 
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
I think I underemphasized that at least
 
00:29:59.930 --> 00:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
for my own learning last time so so the
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
footnotes uh I've talked to
 
00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney to help help keep
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
reminding me to bring those footnotes
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
forward so that we can discuss them and
 
00:30:11.389 --> 00:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
then similar to that if there's an hb2
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
item that's tied to one of the
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
Departments obviously we're going to
 
00:30:18.409 --> 00:30:18.419 align:start position:0%
talk about the HD hb2 item at the same
 
00:30:18.419 --> 00:30:21.830 align:start position:0%
talk about the HD hb2 item at the same
time

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
I'm going to tell you the major
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
challenge The Epiphany I had okay so so
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
some of you may know that I'm a
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
republican some of you may know that
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
what that means to me is that when I
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
look at the government spending uh I'm
 
00:30:42.409 --> 00:30:42.419 align:start position:0%
I'm taking a look at programs to be
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
effective and efficient and to evaluate
 
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
whether or not the the money that we're
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
being that we're being asked to spend is
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to be spent you know well you know
 
00:30:54.529 --> 00:30:54.539 align:start position:0%
we want to we we want to behave as
 
00:30:54.539 --> 00:30:56.450 align:start position:0%
we want to we we want to behave as
fiduciaries

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries
 
00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:58.740 align:start position:0%
so I thought this was going to be a
 
00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:00.500 align:start position:0%
fairly straightforward analytical
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
process I thought we could ask the
 
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
Departments to come in and tell us what
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
their performance metrics were and we
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
could take a look at their performance
 
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
metrics as a way of determining whether
 
00:31:12.289 --> 00:31:12.299 align:start position:0%
or not they were being effective or
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
efficient and and I I came to appreciate
 
00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
that the the Department's internal
 
00:31:21.769 --> 00:31:21.779 align:start position:0%
metrics are are not cooked they're not
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time so we're going to
 
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:26.220 align:start position:0%
have Meredith tell us come in and talk
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
to us about the status and I've told her
 
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
that it's not going to be a a gotcha
 
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
kind of exercise
 
00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
but so on one hand we don't really have
 
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
the performance metrics to look at but
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
then and but then it gets a little
 
00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:42.140 align:start position:0%
Messier because
 
00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
we get so much Federal money and in
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
order to get the federal money we have
 
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
to match it oftentimes with General
 
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
funds and and then there's some minimums
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
that we have to meet and the like and so
 
00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
what ends up is practically every
 
00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
program from a money perspective has
 
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
this high level of intermingling where
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
if you try to pull out you know some
 
00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
general funds you're pulling down the
 
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
the federal funds and there's a little
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
death spiral in there that some people
 
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
want to avoid so it's not as easy to do
 
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
a program a review and Analysis with an
 
00:32:25.389 --> 00:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate budget
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
allocation exercise at least not in the
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
way I I tend to view it it's just a
 
00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.059 align:start position:0%
challenge the other challenge is if you
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
take a look at a program and you say oh
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
look here's an FTE
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
I don't really think this is a
 
00:32:42.289 --> 00:32:42.299 align:start position:0%
particularly great program I want to cut
 
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
that program well what you're going to
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
hear is well you know that's not really
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
an FTE that's that's uh that's uh that's
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
Joe and and Joe he works on four or five
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
different programs and so if you cut Joe
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
from that program he's still going to be
 
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
around for the other four programs so
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
you're really not going to cut you know
 
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
that FTE so it's just what I'm just
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
letting you know is it's going to be a
 
00:33:12.049 --> 00:33:12.059 align:start position:0%
challenge for those of us who really
 
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
want to push on having a lean mean
 
00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:19.190 align:start position:0%
want to push on having a lean mean
Department

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
um and and that's and that's kind of the
 
00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:24.620 align:start position:0%
reality is I see it of working with DHHS
 
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hull did you have
 
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
something you want to say I saw your
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
hand move I didn't know if that was
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
you're getting ready to throw something
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
at me or no thank you
 
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
um and I think the problems you just
 
00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:39.299 align:start position:0%
mentioned are going to be further
 
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
compounded by
 
00:33:42.889 --> 00:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
cares act funding and other funding that
 
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
has come in from the federal level right
 
00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
significantly in the in the Health and
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
Human Services domain that is now either
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
created new positions or new programs or
 
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
and how do we extract out what was some
 
00:33:57.889 --> 00:33:57.899 align:start position:0%
of those one-time payments so that we
 
00:33:57.899 --> 00:33:58.909 align:start position:0%
of those one-time payments so that we
can

00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
look at that and say this new program
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
that got started under
 
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
some of these federal grants is this
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
something we want to continue those are
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of questions there because
 
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
large sums of money
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
that came in in one-time grants
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
so so I I agree with you and I think
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
you've brought up
 
00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:22.619 align:start position:0%
a related you know on tangent issue
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
which is there was a lot of one-time
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
money presumably for one-time programs
 
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
and at some point that Federal money
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
is going to go away and then somebody's
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
going to have to be confronted with the
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
reality of what we do with that program
 
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
when it there's no longer federal
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
assistance for it and and that that
 
00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:47.099 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a tough day and I
 
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
don't know uh how much of that we're
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
going to see in this budget cycle but in
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
theory we could see a bunch of that
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
do you have any comments on that Mr
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
Ripple no okay
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess I would encourage each
 
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
of us to be oh I'm sorry did you have a
 
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.630 align:start position:0%
of us to be oh I'm sorry did you have a
question

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to have to work on
 
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
pronouncing your last name I know it
 
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
starts with a t-e-l and you got a K in
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.950 align:start position:0%
okay
talinski

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
talinski
 
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
tolersky I'm I'm sorry
 
00:35:30.849 --> 00:35:30.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
okay so representative Walling you
 
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
you've been down this terrain a lot in
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
division three is there anything I said
 
00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
about the difficulty of uh unpacking the
 
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
intermingled nature of DHHS that you
 
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
would say differently or you view
 
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.370 align:start position:0%
would say differently or you view
differently

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
um well I think I think the department
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
has always been really
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
helpful to us in helping us understand
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
the mix of federal
 
00:36:01.609 --> 00:36:01.619 align:start position:0%
money and how much State money we're
 
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
going to need so they and I think that's
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
something as a division we need to
 
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
always be reminding ourselves to ask
 
00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
them for those details but they've been
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
really good about providing that kind of
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
information because there's a number of
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
things I mean they sometimes you need a
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
one-on-one match sometimes it's a
 
00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
different mix of a match and sometimes
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
it's that you have to meet
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
you have to meet a level of funding
 
00:36:29.329 --> 00:36:29.339 align:start position:0%
State funding from several years ago you
 
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
have to at least meet that
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
um so I think if we just work with the
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
Department closely on those things that
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
they'll provide the kinds of information
 
00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
we need to really understand what we
 
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
have to what we're responsible for
 
00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
funding and as far as the um
 
00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
Federal money that's come in I think if
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
in fact there are areas that the
 
00:36:51.839 --> 00:36:52.930 align:start position:0%
in fact there are areas that the
department

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:52.940 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
knows that there's funding mixed into
 
00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
that was from those funds arpa funds or
 
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
cares funds I think they should alert us
 
00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
to that I
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
um separated and that they're really not
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
mixed into the budget I think
 
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
is that right Kevin
 
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
just to cheat I see Mr White nodding
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
uh okay so representative did you want
 
00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
to say anything in this
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
section about the intermingled nature of
 
00:37:38.329 --> 00:37:38.339 align:start position:0%
DHHS and the challenge because because
 
00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
you've really worked the spreadsheets as
 
00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
well there's no doubt it's a challenge
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
as far as the R Pro slash covid funds go
 
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
those have all come through fiscal and
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
because in hb2 last time we were
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
prevented the addition of full-time
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
employees all of those are part-time so
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
they really don't show up in the budget
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't show up on the budget and
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
if they do then they should be new
 
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
positions that we should be able to see
 
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
basically so I'm not too concerned about
 
00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.190 align:start position:0%
basically so I'm not too concerned about
that

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.930 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
yeah it's uh it's good
 
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.490 align:start position:0%
yeah it's uh it's good
well

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
as I've discussed in the past with the
 
00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
chairman I had hoped that we would get
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
presentations from the Department that
 
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
really right up front tied
 
00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
the programs
 
00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
to the budget
 
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
to the success rate it doesn't sound
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
like that's necessarily going to happen
 
00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
but I think that's really what we need
 
00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
to be looking at in terms of trying to
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
okay do you do you Mr chair you have
 
00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
anything you want to say in here about
 
00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
your expectations for division three
 
00:38:58.849 --> 00:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
well I'm looking down and I've been to
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
the other divisions briefly
 
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:02.510 align:start position:0%
the other divisions briefly
um

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:04.220 align:start position:0%
I think you're you're setting up
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
hearings on like house bill 49. and I
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
haven't scheduled it for the full
 
00:39:13.609 --> 00:39:13.619 align:start position:0%
committee yet because I keep getting day
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
by day more bills so I want to find out
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
exactly how many bills they had before I
 
00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:20.339 align:start position:0%
set up the schedule
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
um so you're you're getting in it and we
 
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
talked in division two which has most of
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
these bills and they're kind of
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
looking at it as an oversight rather
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
than having the full hearing because
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
we'll have the full Hearing in the
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
committee anyway for all these bills but
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
if you're starting early then one of the
 
00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
suggestions was just have the department
 
00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
come in and give the oversight like on
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
49 what they plan what they've done and
 
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
so on because we may have a flood of
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
people coming thinking this is the
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
public hearing and you may get in your
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
case it's not as bad because you only
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
got the one bill but over there if
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
they've got six bills and they're trying
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
to do them all in one day and they get
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
flooded with all sorts of people that
 
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
want to testify
 
00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
personally on things it's better to try
 
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
to just have set it up for an overview
 
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
by the department and then and then have
 
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:11.339 align:start position:0%
then have the public hearing here and
 
00:40:14.089 --> 00:40:14.099 align:start position:0%
your people will be better informed
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
by the department of what what to expect
 
00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
but we'll fill in everybody else on the
 
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
committee so that that's a little bit
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
different than the way we've done it in
 
00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:24.839 align:start position:0%
the past but it's because of the slow
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
nature of getting all the bills to us
 
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
one other announcement I'd like to make
 
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
to the Republicans is when you're done
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
here about 2 30 we're going to meet over
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
here in 212 for a caucus and we expect
 
00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.910 align:start position:0%
here in 212 for a caucus and we expect
the

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.569 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:40:38.569 --> 00:40:38.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
the majority lead it to be there so
 
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
I haven't got uh
 
00:40:45.609 --> 00:40:45.619 align:start position:0%
full uh
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
confirmation yet whether he'll be there
 
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
or not but like to meet 2 30 with the
 
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
Republicans over here in 212.
 
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
do you want do you want to I haven't
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned it to anyone yet about
 
00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.250 align:start position:0%
mentioned it to anyone yet about
um

00:40:58.250 --> 00:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
um on exact day uh having you present
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
yes when you want to exec make sure I'm
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
here I want to be able to participate in
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
all your votes I am an ex-officio member
 
00:41:13.849 --> 00:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir and then um if if exec
 
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
days are really important so if you
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
cannot be here
 
00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
um if either Republicans you've got to
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
let me or uh representative Mooney know
 
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:30.180 align:start position:0%
and I would assume that the Democrats
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
want to let representative norgren and
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
and you perhaps as a fallback
 
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
do you want to say something to that uh
 
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
representative Northern
 
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
oh I got it
 
00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.210 align:start position:0%
oh I got it
[Music]

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:44.990 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
okay so one of the things that I've been
 
00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
asking about for the last couple years
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
and and that is
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
um as the department has come to to us I
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
have asked questions about whether or
 
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
not we see any inequality in our Health
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
Care system that we should be aware of
 
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
and that we should be addressing and I
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
probably asked a question similar to
 
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
that you know five to ten times and
 
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
almost every time I ask it the kind of
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
comments I get after the the committee
 
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
meeting is well why is he asking that
 
00:42:26.089 --> 00:42:26.099 align:start position:0%
well I've been asking that to get my
 
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
head ready for a lot of the bills I
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
think we're going to be hearing this
 
00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:35.300 align:start position:0%
year that will involve diversity
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
inclusiveness and equity and so so it
 
00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
seems to me that in general based on
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
what I've been hearing over the last two
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
years New Hampshire is a pretty good
 
00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
place in terms of making sure our Health
 
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
Care system works for everyone
 
00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
and but I think we should all continue
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
to test that one of the things that I uh
 
00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
that we heard during the joint economic
 
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
briefing was a professor from UNH were
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
you there still representative walner
 
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
when he presented I I thought he was
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
going to leave us those slides but those
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
slides apparently are proprietary and
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
he's not going to I'm going to have to
 
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
ask him for some of them but some of
 
00:43:21.609 --> 00:43:21.619 align:start position:0%
them were excellent in terms of like
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
identifying very specifically where in
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
um a kind of a disproportionate number
 
00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:34.460 align:start position:0%
of the local demographic
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
qualifying for low-income or minority
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
status and so so I I I'm going to
 
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
continue to try to get
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
those diversity Maps because I think it
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
would make us all smarter when we we
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
hear about the concerns being brought To
 
00:43:55.609 --> 00:43:55.619 align:start position:0%
Us by Advocates to ensure equality I
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
prefer the word equality to equity but
 
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
that's I won't get into that but but uh
 
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
we uh that we can all sort of be doing
 
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
our own sanity check and due diligence
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure that New Hampshire is a
 
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
good place for everyone to live
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
um I I just have a few thoughts on
 
00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
decorum and
 
00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
um we're going to be broadcasting all
 
00:44:22.609 --> 00:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
the time so so
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
um uh this is a pretty professional
 
00:44:28.569 --> 00:44:28.579 align:start position:0%
group and I think the
 
00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:32.339 align:start position:0%
state expects a seriousness of their
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
finance and Ways and Means committees
 
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
and some other committees I just hope
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
that we continue to present
 
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
professionally to the public you know
 
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
because uh you know we're now more
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
visible than we were two terms ago so I
 
00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
just think we should be careful about
 
00:44:49.859 --> 00:44:50.890 align:start position:0%
just think we should be careful about
that

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:50.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I tend to do
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
is when there's a person testifying and
 
00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:04.859 align:start position:0%
somebody's asks a question
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
um mini chairman if not most expect that
 
00:45:11.089 --> 00:45:11.099 align:start position:0%
the second or third question you come
 
00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
back to the chairman say I have a
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up or I have another question or
 
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
you know there's sort of this uh
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
staccato back and forth that I I don't
 
00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
really care for
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
so what I'm willing to do is if you
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
would like to ask questions if you could
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
just give me some idea like I I got two
 
00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
or three questions I'd like to ask then
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
I would like you to just go have that
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
sort of question and answer without you
 
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
know being interrupted by coming back to
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
the chair because I don't that doesn't
 
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
add any value as far as I'm concerned
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
the value that gets added though is if
 
00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
somebody goes off on a tangent and
 
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:56.579 align:start position:0%
starts asking too many questions or
 
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
something I I reserve the right to to
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
gavel and retake control of the Q a and
 
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
but other than that uh I'd much rather
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
sit here and enjoy a really great
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
educational conversation between the
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
legislator and the person providing the
 
00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
testimony and not be thinking about the
 
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
you know sort of the format and the
 
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
rules and stuff I just as soon let those
 
00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
conversations take place and um and I I
 
00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
that was kind of the operating rule of
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
thumb last term and and representative
 
00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
Waller you you were still incredibly
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
polite keep you kept coming back to me
 
00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:38.339 align:start position:0%
to ask me for a second question and
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
stuff I just want to assure you I really
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
mean it this term if you want to just
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
you know continuing natural dialogue
 
00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly fine and I think I
 
00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
think last term I can only remember one
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
time maybe there were two times but I
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
can only remember one time where it it
 
00:46:59.650 --> 00:46:59.660 align:start position:0%
got a little heated
 
00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.250 align:start position:0%
got a little heated
and

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
um there was only one sort of bad gavel
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
moment and so so uh I I take
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
responsibility for that because it was
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
the first time I'd experienced it I
 
00:47:14.089 --> 00:47:14.099 align:start position:0%
think I I was it behaved in my authority
 
00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:16.940 align:start position:0%
but I probably didn't uh you know
 
00:47:19.609 --> 00:47:19.619 align:start position:0%
what I did was okay how I did it was
 
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
probably subject to review but so I just
 
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
intend to just treat everyone with
 
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
respect I don't see us as a group of
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
partisans I see us as a group of
 
00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
fiduciaries trying to figure out you
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
know how do we make these programs work
 
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
for our citizens uh and how do we do it
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
in a way in which we protect taxpayers
 
00:47:40.319 --> 00:47:41.930 align:start position:0%
in a way in which we protect taxpayers
so

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:41.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
um those those are kind of things I
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk about are there any other
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
or the comments or questions uh yes Mr
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
clerk I want to acknowledge and thank
 
00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
you profusely for accepting the vital
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
role of being our clerk thank you well
 
00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:02.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for the invitation and it's an
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
honor and uh I guess it's been four
 
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
years since uh since you and I first
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
served on committee together I haven't
 
00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
seen any instance where we've had to
 
00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
bang the gavel and uh go against each
 
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
other uh if if it happens we'll get by
 
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
it but I don't expect it will I'm
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
looking forward to the work again I have
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
a question you mentioned earlier today
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
that um uh that you had a second
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
priority I think it was employment a
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
priority that sounds like a budget
 
00:48:36.119 --> 00:48:38.050 align:start position:0%
priority that sounds like a budget
priority

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:38.060 align:start position:0%
priority
 
00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
for the committee uh do you oh oh okay I
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
I'm I may not be responding on point but
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
um Mr Ripple to kick off listed like
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
eight strategic topics that we're going
 
00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
to go over
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to start with it very
 
00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
early on if not number one okay we're
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
going to take the Manpower overview it's
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
a very high priority if not number two
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh and and the rest of them are are are
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
in there and they're priorities because
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about them
 
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
programmatically before the 15th of
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
February does that address your question
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so and so the things like
 
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
glencliffe and the New Hampshire
 
00:49:22.609 --> 00:49:22.619 align:start position:0%
hospitals the input that you got are
 
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
things that you're kind of adding to
 
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
that list or integrating into that list
 
00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:29.339 align:start position:0%
of what we're going to be doing uh and
 
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
getting a jump on before February 15th
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
right right so so by sitting in with HHS
 
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh to do uh to see that their committee
 
00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:44.579 align:start position:0%
do the orientation that obviated having
 
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
us do the same thing with with DHHS
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
which gives us even more dead time to
 
00:49:53.089 --> 00:49:53.099 align:start position:0%
fill between now and the 15th February
 
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
and that's that's where I think we can
 
00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
do good work and and just look at the
 
00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
programmatic levels without the dollars
 
00:49:59.819 --> 00:50:01.790 align:start position:0%
programmatic levels without the dollars
associated

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
associated
 
00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am wait a second we have to we
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
to this is an eyesight test to tolersky
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
excellent perfect okay talersky thank
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
you quick question on
 
00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
um your time management and scheduling
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
and how you handle it I know we got
 
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
notifications the division would be
 
00:50:32.089 --> 00:50:32.099 align:start position:0%
meeting starting at 10 A.M uh two days
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
coming up maybe in
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
two weeks I'm just curious when we get
 
00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
those notices should we assume it's a
 
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
morning and afternoon session or is that
 
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
specifically a morning session and a 1pm
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
meeting this time would be also issued
 
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
if we were going to be in the afternoon
 
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
that that's an excellent question at
 
00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
this point you should have already begun
 
00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:56.700 align:start position:0%
receiving division three Finance notices
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I know that the for sure February 1st
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
and 3rd went out as did the like the
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
27th or whatever that date is or I just
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I understand did you
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
get those or not I did and they say 10
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
a.m only and I'm just curious if that is
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
to be expected to have a full day with
 
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
the afternoon also initially these first
 
00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:18.059 align:start position:0%
ones I don't think we could fill the
 
00:51:20.569 --> 00:51:20.579 align:start position:0%
whole day because not the the we're
 
00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
working around the department a bit and
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
so we're probably going to have you know
 
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
one or two or three of these sessions
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
depending on the ability of the
 
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
department to cooperate and coordinate
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
schedules with us so so I I think if we
 
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
if we start at 10 which is a general
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
good start time
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
um then
 
00:51:44.569 --> 00:51:44.579 align:start position:0%
um we we could be done by 12 30
 
00:51:44.579 --> 00:51:46.190 align:start position:0%
um we we could be done by 12 30
generally

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
generally
 
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
and if we can't we'll recess go eat some
 
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
lunch and try to wrap it up
 
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts on that I mean
 
00:51:56.089 --> 00:51:56.099 align:start position:0%
you're you're in Nashua yes right so I'm
 
00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
trying to figure so representative
 
00:51:59.930 --> 00:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
Stringham you're actually the one that
 
00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:04.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
does anyone travel more than an hour
 
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
hour and 15.
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
so if we start at 10 o'clock
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
as a rule representative nordgren does
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
that give you plenty of time to to get
 
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
here do if we try to start at nine or 9
 
00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:32.300 align:start position:0%
30 is that an inconvenience for you
 
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:33.890 align:start position:0%
30 is that an inconvenience for you
so

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:36.470 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I can't help you with 89. Mr
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
Ripple's good but he's not that good so
 
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay so for now I think we're going to
 
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
start a standard 10 o'clock and go until
 
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
complete and the first until we get to
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
the 15th of February those days are
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you Mr
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and why we have Mr Ripple still
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to take this opportunity
 
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
to just briefly discuss the budget LBA
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
tab of the website there is a huge
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
amount of information there which is all
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
very helpful is there anything in
 
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
particular you'd like to point out to
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
the committee or those that may be
 
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
watching that could be helpful as we
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:27.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:29.569 --> 00:53:29.579 align:start position:0%
well I think you could take a look at
 
00:53:32.569 --> 00:53:32.579 align:start position:0%
the previous session the 2223 budget and
 
00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
maybe take a look at
 
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
one thing that I know you asked for and
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
that the committee might find helpful is
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
every two years the department presents
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
a briefing book uh that consists of
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
all accounting units with at least a
 
00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars in them so that'll be
 
00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:50.300 align:start position:0%
coming out for the upcoming budget
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
sometime after February 15th late
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
February maybe but you can take a look
 
00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
at the one for 22 23 to get a sense of
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
what's in there and where the big
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
dollars are so that may be helpful to
 
00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
look at
 
00:54:01.859 --> 00:54:02.870 align:start position:0%
look at
um

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
you can also look at
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how helpful the Surplus
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
statement would be at this point but you
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
talked about lapse representative
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
Edwards the Surplus statement is a great
 
00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
place to go to see the big picture not
 
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
just of HHS but the Statewide budget as
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
a whole to show you where the
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are not only in hb1 but
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
also in hb2 or any other bills to show
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
you the expected laps to show you the
 
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
projected revenues and sort of get a
 
00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
sense of how that fits together for the
 
00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
overall state budget so those are two
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
two documents that I might take a look
 
00:54:40.609 --> 00:54:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
so this is uh kind of in the informal
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
times Mr Williams Mr White do you have
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
anything that you want to volunteer for
 
00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we've technically met
 
00:54:58.970 --> 00:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
you yet so
 
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
my name is Nathan white I'm the Chief
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer for the Department of
 
00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:05.400 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I just didn't prepare anything formal
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
today was more just here to be a fly on
 
00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
the wall but
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
um I think everything that that's been
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
said here has been pretty accurate about
 
00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:18.740 align:start position:0%
the complexities of dhhs's budget
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with DHHS unfortunately
 
00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:23.460 align:start position:0%
for for better for worse
 
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:24.900 align:start position:0%
um you know when when we do look at
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
positions or we look at programs
 
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there is a federal match
 
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:30.410 align:start position:0%
oftentimes there is a federal match
component

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
component
 
00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:31.980 align:start position:0%
um you know for example many of our
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
contracts per se may have up to 10
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
various funding sources so we do braid
 
00:55:39.049 --> 00:55:39.059 align:start position:0%
and blend funding to try to best
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
leverage the federal funds that are
 
00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
available and The Limited General funds
 
00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:44.150 align:start position:0%
available and The Limited General funds
so

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
um I I again I just want to reiterate
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
that everything that's been said around
 
00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
that is certainly true
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
um Kevin was just referring to the
 
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:53.819 align:start position:0%
budget briefing book we are working on
 
00:55:55.849 --> 00:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
updated budget briefing books and I'd
 
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
actually our plan right now is to start
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
to look at incorporating some of those
 
00:56:02.569 --> 00:56:02.579 align:start position:0%
key outcomes and performance metrics
 
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
into that budget briefing book so that
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
we can have a document that's a little
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
bit more unified so that you can look at
 
00:56:11.089 --> 00:56:11.099 align:start position:0%
the big million dollar accounts and then
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
within that that document is great
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
because it has here are the RSA
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
requirements that we need to consider
 
00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
here's the population here's the
 
00:56:20.930 --> 00:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
mechanism the delivery of service is it
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
Direct Care from HHS is it done on
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
um you know through through a contracted
 
00:56:28.970 --> 00:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
service so forth and so on
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
um but what we're really trying to do is
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
update that and I've had a couple of
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
conversations with
 
00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
um with representative erf about that to
 
00:56:38.089 --> 00:56:38.099 align:start position:0%
try to make that document a little bit
 
00:56:40.609 --> 00:56:40.619 align:start position:0%
more tangible to really tie the numbers
 
00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
to the program uh and try to get away
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
from those presentations where we talk
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
about the program over here and then we
 
00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
talk about the budget and it's really
 
00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
hard to make those connections between
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
hb1 which on its face does not really
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
have a lot of description and and
 
00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
supporting documentation to really
 
00:56:59.329 --> 00:56:59.339 align:start position:0%
explain that so we are working on that
 
00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
we are also working on those
 
00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
presentations that that have been
 
00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
requested uh for
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
um the doit presentation initially and
 
00:57:11.089 --> 00:57:11.099 align:start position:0%
then the subsequent presentations on
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
February 1st and February 3rd so
 
00:57:16.849 --> 00:57:16.859 align:start position:0%
um that's a quick overview
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
um just a couple of General comments
 
00:57:21.349 --> 00:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
um uh you know I I know that that Kevin
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
will act as the as the conduit for
 
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:28.380 align:start position:0%
um I will do my best to get any requests
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
that you have in as timely a manner as
 
00:57:30.359 --> 00:57:31.670 align:start position:0%
that you have in as timely a manner as
possible

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
um we we certainly our department as you
 
00:57:35.809 --> 00:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
probably heard we are at about 22
 
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:38.339 align:start position:0%
vacancy depending on the day
 
00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
um so we do have limitations so so the
 
00:57:43.609 --> 00:57:43.619 align:start position:0%
the if you're able to get those requests
 
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
in earlier that will just be really
 
00:57:47.089 --> 00:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
helpful because I know that the budget
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
process it's five weeks it goes really
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
quick and to the extent that we have my
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
staff and my team uh and and the other
 
00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
division directors so forth and so on
 
00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
have time available
 
00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
um to try to get answers for you as
 
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
um that that will just help I think make
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
the process go better but again through
 
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
this whole process I'll be as candid and
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
open and honest with with all of you as
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
I can be please don't hesitate to reach
 
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
out if you you do have questions more
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
than happy to have any conversations
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
so so I want to just tell you that
 
00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
you're stepping into some tough shoes to
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
fill I really appreciated working with
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
Karen rounds last cycle the thing that
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
impressed me about Karen was was even
 
00:58:36.839 --> 00:58:38.829 align:start position:0%
impressed me about Karen was was even
when

00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:58:42.289 --> 00:58:42.299 align:start position:0%
something was a like a somewhere in the
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
department some professional little goof
 
00:58:47.089 --> 00:58:47.099 align:start position:0%
up that they were fixing and there was
 
00:58:49.609 --> 00:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
no dodging or hiding and you know it's a
 
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
huge organization so there's always
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
going to be room to fix little things
 
00:58:56.809 --> 00:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
and so so what was nice about those
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
instances was knowing that she was being
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
transparent and honest because that sort
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
of sets the stage for some of the bigger
 
00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
questions that we end up needing to rely
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
on the answer so
 
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
early on in the cycle I as a rule always
 
00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
kind of went through Mr Ripple to the
 
00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:20.510 align:start position:0%
kind of went through Mr Ripple to the
Department

00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
um I I gotta tell you though is we got
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
very close to that that deadline where
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
the division three had to uh is shut
 
00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.809 align:start position:0%
the division three had to uh is shut
down

00:59:29.809 --> 00:59:29.819 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
um uh there were a lot of conversations
 
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
with Karen like the weekend before kind
 
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
of stuff and so so so I think the rule
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
of thumb is we'd like to go ahead and
 
00:59:39.839 --> 00:59:41.089 align:start position:0%
of thumb is we'd like to go ahead and
use

00:59:41.089 --> 00:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
um a proper uh coordination process and
 
00:59:48.010 --> 00:59:48.020 align:start position:0%
just try not to create too much chaos
 
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
except that that gets imposed on us at
 
00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:53.099 align:start position:0%
the end but
 
00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:55.260 align:start position:0%

00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
