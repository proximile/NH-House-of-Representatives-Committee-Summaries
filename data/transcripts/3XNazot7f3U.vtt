00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
the idea was was simply that when we
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
talked to the secretary of state every
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
few years we have a time period
 
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.029 align:start position:0%
few years we have a time period
where

00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
the september state primary will happen
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
just eight weeks before the general
 
00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:52.150 align:start position:0%
just eight weeks before the general
election

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
and for some of our overseas military
 
00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.669 align:start position:0%
and for some of our overseas military
personnel

00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
and merchant mariners
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
they're not able to get their overseas
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
ballot to them
 
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
uh from the state primary and get it
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
back in time so this is simply about our
 
00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.029 align:start position:0%
back in time so this is simply about our
overseas

00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
overseas
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
military people being able to uh be sure
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
that they get a vote we found that uh
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
it's a few hundred votes a year that end
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
up not getting counted and those are the
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
people who are overseas uh fighting for
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
our right to vote and so i i believe
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%

the clickers
 
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
the clerk's informed me that they'll
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%

uh
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
this uh bill essentially was a attempt
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
to correct an error in the statute of
 
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.029 align:start position:0%
to correct an error in the statute of
limitations

00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
it was a result of
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
a constituent in my district his son
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
starting at age four
 
00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:14.789 align:start position:0%
starting at age four
was

00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
physically abused by his stepfather very
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
very badly something that continued for
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
many many years
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
by the time this was reported to the
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
police and was to be sent to the
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
county attorney's office to be
 
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.630 align:start position:0%
county attorney's office to be
prosecuted

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
prosecuted
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
they were told that because the statute
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
of limitations of six years had run out
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
that there was simply no way that they
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
could prosecute
 
00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
this particular case so
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
we found that there are many many child
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
abuse cases where the abuser and even
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
criminals who are attacking children are
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
getting off scot-free
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
by simply running out the clock the
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
six-year statute of limitations
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
so i took up this bill
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
in fact i ran for re-election in part to
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
put this bill in
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
and it was the simple intent was
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
that similar to sexual assault the clock
 
00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't start running under this bill
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
until the victim turns age 18.
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
so the victim would have until they're
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
effectively 24 years old to report the
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
crime and go ahead and go after the uh
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
the child abuser or the attacker
 
00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:21.350 align:start position:0%
the child abuser or the attacker
now

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
at no point
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh during the process did anyone come
 
00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
forward in either the state house or the
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
state senate and testify against this
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
bill in fact
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
the the bill this is the second time
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
through the bill had unanimous support
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
in the house criminal justice committee
 
00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
had unanimous support on the floor it
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
had unanimous support in the senate
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee and in the floor of
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
the senate there was not a single member
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
of the general court who voted against
 
00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:46.710 align:start position:0%
of the general court who voted against
this

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
and i want to thank members for
 
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
there was not
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
a single witness who came out and
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
testified and it wasn't until the veto
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
came in
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
that anyone had raised an objection
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i as the bill's sponsor
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
have not received any contact about
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
whatever whoever this mystery person is
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
from any of the ten county attorney's
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
offices or the

department of justice
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
out of hundreds of people possible i've
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
tried contacting the governor's
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%

remember the members of this house look
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
back at the bill and try to figure out
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
based on the veto message what the
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
problem is and
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%

in the state house
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%

i rise in support of sustaining the

governor's veto
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is well intended and as the
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
previous speaker just said it passed on
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
consent last term and this term
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
however at the point where the
 
00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
legislative process was completed there
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
were some concerns raised about some
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
as part of the veto
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
they were nice enough to at least
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
provide some suggested language that
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
would accomplish the bill's objective
 
00:30:59.430 --> 00:30:59.440 align:start position:0%

without these potential unattended
consequences

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
that language has been provided
 
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
and it's available on on the governor's
 
00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.750 align:start position:0%

we work together in the committee we'll
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%

why this bill was brought forward
 
00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:28.160 align:start position:0%

really funny mister
speaker

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
is if i have a valid
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%

i can't
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
that is pretty silly so that is what
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
this bill does it just repeals that
 
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:03.750 align:start position:0%
this bill does it just repeals that
section

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%

tells many people that they literally
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
have to abandon their firearm on the
 
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.030 align:start position:0%
have to abandon their firearm on the
trail

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
trail
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
and i felt that that was a dangerous
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
situation and that that isn't something
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
when i used to teach firearm safety i
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
would never have suggested anything as
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
absurd as that and yet that's
 
00:47:36.069 --> 00:47:36.079 align:start position:0%
essentially what fish and game the fish
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
and game role does under those
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
admittedly rare circumstances the state
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
should never
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
under any circumstances tell people to
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
do that they have to do the unsafe thing
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
that if somebody does have a firearm or
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
if someone in their party has a firearm
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
they should never have to abandon their
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
firearm you should be allowed to take
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
your firearm with you back to your truck
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
or back to your your home and uh and
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
transport it i think that that's just a
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
matter of principle now there is an rsa
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
627 section 3 the competing harms
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
defense if you were ever charged you
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
could theoretically take this to court
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
and say that you're trying to prevent a
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
greater competing harm
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
but nobody should ever be
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
fined and have to
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
have to take that issue up i i think
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
the state should never have a rule ever
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
that tells people that they have to do
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
something that's unsafe
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
remember yield to a question
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
yes i will remember yields thank you mr
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
speaker thank you for taking my question
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not a hunter i'm not a snowmobiler
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
or any of that stuff there but i do see
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
stories of bear
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
wolves coyote throughout new hampshire
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
when you're on our trails
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
and you can't have a loaded gun
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
how do you handle that if you come
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
across one of them black bears or
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
coyote or anything
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
without a around in your weapon i mean
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
well if you're on a trail and you're
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
attacked by a bear you better hope that
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
you're an army guy
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh because uh if you're unarmed uh you
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
better be a lot tougher than the average
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
average uh bear
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh but yeah you're right
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
you've got to have a firearm to defend
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
yourself i'll tell you that even though
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
seabrook is actually strangely
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
considered part of a you know urban
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
compact it's considered an urban zone by
 
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
the u.s census
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
we have wild animals going through my
 
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
backyard all the time literally all the
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
time we've had everything from fisher
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
cats to cougars and other other types of
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
animals coming through seabrook or
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
mountain lions i should say
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
this member yield to another question
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%

00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
lot of chatter we can hear up here
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%

yes he is going to yield thank you he's
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker thank you member
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
for asking the question it would
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
surprise you to know that i spoke to
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
fish and game about this bill and the
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
executive director they have not
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
enforced this law since we passed
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
constitutional carry for that same exact
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
reason and that they would support a
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
clean bill
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
does the member yield to a further
 
00:50:29.839 --> 00:50:30.950 align:start position:0%
does the member yield to a further
question

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
um i would say i would say that the bill
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
is a clean bill i don't i i do not
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
understand what the objection is with
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
the language
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
associated with it from the governor's
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
veto message
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes i will take another question
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
representative you may inquire thank you
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
mr speaker my concern is not the intent
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
all of it sounds good to me i support
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
the right to bear arms
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
my concern is that this seeds some
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
authority from new hampshire officials
 
00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
to grant
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
permission to purchase a gun
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
the last several years have shown us
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
that representative you were
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
you were
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
asking a question
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
yes how does uh how does this bill
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
protect us
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
if we leave it as intact all the all the
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
sections of it how does this bill
 
00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
protect us from capricious response by
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
the fbi
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
in another state very difficult to reach
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
how does it protect us
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
by removing the new hampshire
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
arm of the processors of purchasing a
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
gun the gun line how does this protect
 
00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:47.990 align:start position:0%
gun the gun line how does this protect
us

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.990 align:start position:0%
us
from

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
i i i deny by denying our our access to
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
all right so i i think i understand the
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
question i i believe that this uh issue
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
was discussed when the bill went through
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
committee the first time and i i didn't
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
hear anyone
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
raise that objection from the actual
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
language of the bill so i don't agree
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:20.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
yeah just uh just a gentle reminder that
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh you should refer to a fellow
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative as representative not
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
their first name thank you
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
the state constitution requires a roll
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
call a two-thirds vote of the member is
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative muse
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
from uh to uh speak to sustain the
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues today i rise to urge you to
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
vote no to sustain the veto of hb 334
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
as originally passed by the house hb 334
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
would have allowed operators in the past
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
and passengers on ohrvs and snowmobiles
 
00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
to carry loaded pistols or revolvers
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
but when the bill came back to us from
 
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
the other body it was amended to include
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
much of the language of another bill a
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
controversial bill that would eliminate
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
the role of the state police gun line
 
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
and handgun background checks
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
as was stated in the veto message
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
changes to the background check process
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
are no longer needed
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
the pandemic may still be with us but
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
the staffing issues the technology
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
issues and the process issues that led
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
to frustrating delays for would-be
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
handgun buyers during the first months
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
of cobit have been fixed
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
domestic violence advocates have also
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
warned us that eliminating the state
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
police role in handgun background checks
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
would open up dangerous holes in the

00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%

from the state police to county sheriffs
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
while the bill appropriates ten thousand

dollars for each county sheriff to pay
 
00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
for training in computer systems
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
this amounts to only a small fraction of
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
what larger counties will need

this bill is not only unnecessary and
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous it's also an
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate for new hampshire
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%

at a1
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
hi mr speaker i just want to point out
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
that roll call is being announced by
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
the sergeant-at-arms while the 30-second
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
window is enacted
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
that is not usually enough time to make
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
it from the restroom to come vote
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
and just wanted to point that out so we
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
can have
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
time for people to make it back for the
 
00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.710 align:start position:0%
time for people to make it back for the
vote

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
pointing the water well taken we'll make
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
so without objection we're going to take
 
00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
okay can i have everyone's attention
 
00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:49.109 align:start position:0%
okay can i have everyone's attention
please

00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
senate bill 38 to come over from the
 
00:58:54.319 --> 00:58:56.470 align:start position:0%
senate bill 38 to come over from the
senate

00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
it seems that they're going to override
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
the governor's veto on that bill
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
the senate hasn't started yet because it
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
seems that a number of their members are
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
caught in traffic trying to get to
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
the state house
 
00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.950 align:start position:0%
the state house
so

00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
and we can't adjourn from 2021 until we
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
without objection we can take up the
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:40.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%

to an amendment for house rules

01:00:37.589 --> 01:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i move an amendment
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
that has been handed out to rule 67 and
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
you may you're recognized to speak thank
 
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.630 align:start position:0%
you may you're recognized to speak thank
you

01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment is drawn is a very
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
simple amendment which permits but does
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
not require
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
remote access
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
for the house its committees and
 
01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.470 align:start position:0%
for the house its committees and
subcommittees

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittees
 
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:03.670 align:start position:0%
subcommittees
so

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
if we need to
 
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
use remote access
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
we do not have a rule have have a rules
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
i know that people have raised the issue
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
of rsa 91a which requires the presence
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
of a quorum that has been resolved by
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's ruled that a presence of a quorum
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
may be determined electronically
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
i also note that our rules are of higher
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
priority than state statute
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
and the courts have affirmed the ability
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
of the house to set its own rules
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
most importantly
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
this provision
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
if passed and implemented
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
would not only provide for safe access
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
both for members
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
and for the public
 
01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:00.950 align:start position:0%
and for the public
but

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
it is a provision that increases public
 
01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:05.589 align:start position:0%
it is a provision that increases public
participation

01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
participation
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
public observation
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
and public comment rather than
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
decreasing it so i would ask you to join
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
me in pushing the green button thank you
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes the member from
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
so my first objection to this proposed
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
rules amendment is that it's a concept
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
and not a plan
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
we've had multiple talks about how you
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
would actually implement something like
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
this and so far i haven't seen anything
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
realistic that would work
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
this is at best premature
 
01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.910 align:start position:0%
this is at best premature
second

01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
my experience over the past well what
 
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
now two years of us meeting virtually is
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
that the house members have come to

screen
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
because of that i believe our processes
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
are broken down there's more animosity
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
less collegiality and it's really
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
important that we get back to that
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
something like this should not be done
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
lightly a complete well thought out plan
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
should be presented and just as an idea
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
has requested a roll call members will

members and the public
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%

01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
navigating this pandemic where things
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
continue to be shifting
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%

navigated the remote accessing committee
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%

in the public eye
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
saying that the reason that we cannot
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
have remote participation is because we
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
do not have a rule and when given the
 
01:09:19.749 --> 01:09:19.759 align:start position:0%
opportunity just now your party voted
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%

the deal that was made that these were
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
going to be non-profit

so that marijuana
 
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:55.520 align:start position:0%

house bill 228
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
i do believe that this issue must be
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
addressed however i also agree that in
 
02:03:44.149 --> 02:03:44.159 align:start position:0%
an effort in reducing conflict between
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
parents and divorce courts that the
 
02:03:48.069 --> 02:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
details of addressing this should be

reduction in conflict is attained
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
one concern are the cases with domestic
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
violence what additional burden could
 
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
this bill deliver for a parent's secret
 
02:04:03.030 --> 02:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
financial relief with little or no
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
thought of the best interest of the
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
child or children solely thinking that
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
the more time spent with my child the
 
02:04:11.189 --> 02:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
greater potential with reducing my
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
support payments
 
02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:15.440 align:start position:0%

02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
the supreme court has interpreted the
 
02:04:37.109 --> 02:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
current language
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
in statute to say that adjustments
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
cannot be made because of parenting time
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
which effectively turns child support
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
into alimony and the calculation is
 
02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
entirely based on money and not based on
 
02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
who is actually parenting
 
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment and this bill now
 
02:04:55.510 --> 02:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
seeks to remedy the confusion the
 
02:04:57.109 --> 02:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
current language has caused in the
 
02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
02:05:00.149 --> 02:05:00.159 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
advocate for you to
 
02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:04.840 align:start position:0%

it's been studied long enough

the proposed interim study
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
will delay the process only further

opening up

are we still waiting for change years

the restaurant and the customer now
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
this bill would benefit both the

02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
together they determined that
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
restaurants should place a simple notice
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
on menus
 
02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
stating that it's the obligation of the
 
02:12:34.149 --> 02:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
customer to inform the server about
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
their food allergy
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%

speaker and fellow representatives the

majority of the members of the commerce
 
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
committee recommend that house bill 65
 
02:13:13.990 --> 02:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
be referred for interim study in order
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
to allow the department of health and
 
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
human services to enact an appropriate
 
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
rule governing food handling safety such
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to allergens referring to
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 65
 
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
for interim study in no means kills this
 
02:13:30.069 --> 02:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
bill or avoids taking any action rather
 
02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
this is precisely the same means
 
02:13:34.149 --> 02:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
used for getting warning statements
 
02:13:36.550 --> 02:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
about consuming raw or undercooked
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
foods added to the bottom of menus and
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
it is precisely the same means used
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
regarding water quality levels in
 
02:13:45.030 --> 02:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
bottled water the difference between
 
02:13:47.669 --> 02:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 65 and those other bills is
 
02:13:50.229 --> 02:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 65 comes with a tragic death
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
that can be exploited when presented
 
02:13:54.229 --> 02:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
with an opportunity to actually
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
accomplish the objective in a manner
 
02:13:59.430 --> 02:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
that was agreeable under less emotional
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
circumstances the minority chose to play
 
02:14:03.990 --> 02:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
on emotions claiming that if it would
 
02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
save even one life it would be worth
 
02:14:08.390 --> 02:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
doing but then they promptly rejected
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to actually do something
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
in a more effective and efficient manner
 
02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
in fact using rules vice legislation is
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
the better means of accomplishing this
 
02:14:20.069 --> 02:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
objective it is more efficient and more
 
02:14:22.629 --> 02:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
effective and it ensures legislative
 
02:14:25.750 --> 02:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
oversight in short it works very well so
 
02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
please vote with the committee
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%

02:14:47.830 --> 02:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
a number of us participated in a
 
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
workshop to return civility

02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
one of our long-standing rules is that

to the opposition
 
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
i believe that i was offended by what
 
02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
was just said about the minorities
 
02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:07.830 align:start position:0%

02:15:09.669 --> 02:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
in that
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
speech that was just given and i i would
 
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
like to bring it to folks attention that
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
there's no reason
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
to charge people
 
02:15:19.510 --> 02:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
with negative
 
02:15:26.229 --> 02:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
of one of our
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
02:15:35.669 --> 02:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
unwritten rules i guess you would call
 
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
it that we do not refer to
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
another member
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
or the minority or the majority
 
02:15:48.550 --> 02:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
in any kind of a derogatory way so i
 
02:15:51.189 --> 02:15:51.199 align:start position:0%
would ask that all members
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
please be careful when you
 
02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:54.790 align:start position:0%
please be careful when you

thoroughly studied
 
02:18:17.549 --> 02:18:17.559 align:start position:0%

regulation can protect the public and
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%

safety and facility standards that
 
02:23:54.870 --> 02:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
protect both the animals and groomers
 
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
and the risk of personal injury
 
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
dogs do die in grooming facilities and
 
02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
most of these deaths are preventable
 
02:24:06.469 --> 02:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
dogs are not the only ones at risk
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
workers have been bitten by dogs that
 
02:24:11.670 --> 02:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
can weigh up to 250 pounds
 
02:24:14.550 --> 02:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
people are also susceptible to zoonic
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
diseases which can spread between
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
animals and people these can be viral
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
bacterial or fungal
 
02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
animal grooming facilities must meet
 
02:24:28.870 --> 02:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
osha standards for health safety
 
02:24:31.110 --> 02:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
equipment sterility and potential
 
02:24:33.190 --> 02:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
injuries what is the purpose of a
 
02:24:35.429 --> 02:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
committee to look at this issue it is to
 
02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
ensure that these facilities protect the
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
public and companion animals from
 
02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
potential armed and to avoid unnecessary
 
02:24:46.630 --> 02:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
liability costs in less ensure and thus
 
02:24:49.270 --> 02:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
ensure that costs to the public remain
 
02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:50.150 align:start position:0%
ensure that costs to the public remain
low

02:24:50.150 --> 02:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
low
 
02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
the most important reason to pass this
 
02:24:54.630 --> 02:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
legislation is to protect these small
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
businesses from the cost of a lengthy
 
02:24:59.510 --> 02:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
and costly legal proceeding
 
02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
relating to the death or injury
 
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
of a companion animal or employee
 
02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
a committee would explore options to
 
02:25:10.469 --> 02:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
minimize the expense and hardship to pet
 
02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
grooming businesses by virtue of
 
02:25:15.110 --> 02:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
preventable deaths and injury to both
 
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
animals and human
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%

thank you colleagues
 
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
i'll keep this short and sweet
 
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i know that this bill was
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
well intended and it is meant to guide
 
02:25:47.110 --> 02:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
dog groomers so that they can do their
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
jobs professionally and with best
 
02:25:49.359 --> 02:25:50.830 align:start position:0%
jobs professionally and with best
practices

02:25:50.830 --> 02:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
practices
 
02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i also know that this
 
02:25:55.830 --> 02:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
would create yet another
 
02:25:58.630 --> 02:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
commission to study something
 
02:26:01.349 --> 02:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
and i also know that there are no
 
02:26:04.230 --> 02:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
national regulating bodies setting
 
02:26:06.309 --> 02:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
standards for this commission to
 
02:26:06.319 --> 02:26:07.910 align:start position:0%
standards for this commission to
investigate

02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
investigate
 
02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:08.790 align:start position:0%
investigate
so

02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
this commission will basically be
 
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
wasting its time by trying to get the
 
02:26:15.910 --> 02:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
government involved trying to regulate
 
02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:16.950 align:start position:0%
government involved trying to regulate
something

02:26:16.950 --> 02:26:16.960 align:start position:0%

02:26:18.309 --> 02:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
with nothing
 
02:26:22.070 --> 02:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
division has been requested members will

02:27:20.950 --> 02:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
this will be a division vote

02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
if i know that there are no common and
 
02:27:33.429 --> 02:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
uniform standards for pet grooming
 
02:27:35.349 --> 02:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
and if i know many groomers would like
 
02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
to study this issue
 
02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
if i know this is only a study committee
 
02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
not a commission
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
and no mandate nor licensing are
 
02:27:44.479 --> 02:27:45.990 align:start position:0%
and no mandate nor licensing are
involved

02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
involved
 
02:27:47.830 --> 02:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
and if i know many of us care deeply
 
02:27:50.550 --> 02:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
about our pets and how they're handled
 
02:27:52.710 --> 02:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
what i vote no so another motion can be
 
02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%

speaker mr speaker if i know
 
02:28:06.070 --> 02:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
that there are no national standards
 
02:28:09.429 --> 02:28:09.439 align:start position:0%
there's no regulations to ensure that
 
02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
there's safe
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%

bill 166 and i want to thank members of

the minority for bringing this issue to
 
02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
our attention
 
02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
it is a life and death issue but we went
 
02:34:36.720 --> 02:34:37.510 align:start position:0%
it is a life and death issue but we went
through

02:34:37.510 --> 02:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
as a committee into the details of the
 
02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:41.830 align:start position:0%
as a committee into the details of the
details

02:34:41.830 --> 02:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
details
 
02:34:45.429 --> 02:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
and what we found was that statistically
 
02:34:47.990 --> 02:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
deaths in pools on foreclosed properties
 
02:34:50.309 --> 02:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
are very rare nationwide
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
and statistically at best i think i uh
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
we estimated that at best you could save
 
02:34:58.389 --> 02:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
one life every 90 80 to 90 years
 
02:35:00.230 --> 02:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
however because
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
some of the pool cover designs could
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
potentially also lead to drownings that
 
02:35:06.790 --> 02:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
it probably even though it's also a
 
02:35:09.429 --> 02:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
statistically small number it might be a
 
02:35:11.910 --> 02:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
safety rule that could potentially
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
cause more
 
02:35:15.270 --> 02:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
deaths than it prevents or cause more
 
02:35:17.349 --> 02:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
drownings than it prevents so for that
 
02:35:19.270 --> 02:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
reason we decided
 
02:35:21.429 --> 02:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
that we couldn't fix the bill as it was
 
02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
and we made the motion to itl
 
02:35:27.030 --> 02:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
please press the green button
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes the member from
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%

02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is about two things
 
02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
protecting new hampshire children from
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
accidental injury
 
02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
or death by drowning
 
02:35:47.230 --> 02:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
in pools on
 
02:35:51.830 --> 02:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
unoccupied foreclosed property
 
02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
it's also
 
02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
about helping reduce the liability of
 
02:35:56.800 --> 02:35:57.910 align:start position:0%
about helping reduce the liability of
lenders

02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
lenders
 
02:35:59.590 --> 02:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
who now own
 
02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:01.600 align:start position:0%

unoccupied foreclosed property
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
by encouraging protective coverings for
 
02:36:11.990 --> 02:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
pools on their foreclosed property
 
02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
i've been asked how common a threat is
 
02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:16.630 align:start position:0%
i've been asked how common a threat is
drowning

02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
drowning
 
02:36:18.150 --> 02:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
we have all
 
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
we have all long known about the danger
 
02:36:23.349 --> 02:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
of attractive nuisances
 
02:36:26.469 --> 02:36:26.479 align:start position:0%
such as open pools and how they affect
 
02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
how they attract and affect children
 
02:36:32.710 --> 02:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
what many of us may not know
 
02:36:36.150 --> 02:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
is that drowning is among the top five
 
02:36:39.030 --> 02:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
causes of death
 
02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:44.070 --> 02:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
i've also been asked who would be
 
02:36:47.349 --> 02:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
affected by the passage of this bill
 
02:36:49.670 --> 02:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
this bill only applies
 
02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%

02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:54.710 align:start position:0%
property
which

02:36:54.710 --> 02:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:36:57.349 --> 02:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
in which the ownership has been returned
 
02:36:59.590 --> 02:36:59.600 align:start position:0%

02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
it does not affect individuals who live
 
02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
on the premises
 
02:37:09.590 --> 02:37:09.600 align:start position:0%

those who whose property was foreclosed
 
02:37:19.750 --> 02:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
let me just

shoulder the expense of the pool cover
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%

speaker
 
02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that when the
 
02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
commerce committee heard this bill
 
02:40:14.630 --> 02:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
we learned that this is actually fannie
 
02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:15.429 align:start position:0%
we learned that this is actually fannie
mae

02:40:15.429 --> 02:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
mae
 
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
so anybody who has a fannie mae loan
 
02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
which is about 60 percent of loans
 
02:40:22.950 --> 02:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
already have this statute and if the

commerce committee was very concerned
 
02:40:27.110 --> 02:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
when they heard testimony from code
 
02:40:29.590 --> 02:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
enforcers and saying how are they
 
02:40:32.710 --> 02:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
possibly going to enforce this let alone
 
02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
the landlord or the owner of the
 
02:40:36.550 --> 02:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
property doesn't exist anymore because
 
02:40:38.550 --> 02:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's foreclosed property
 
02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:40.070 align:start position:0%
it's foreclosed property
so

02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.080 align:start position:0%

money from the medical staff
 
02:48:37.590 --> 02:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
this change is supported by the new

burdens on hospital staff
 
02:48:51.030 --> 02:48:51.040 align:start position:0%

in a timely manner one business day
 
02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
it's a simple
 
02:49:02.389 --> 02:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
but cost effective change
 
02:49:04.309 --> 02:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
particularly in this time of extreme
 
02:49:07.349 --> 02:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
medical burden due to the pandemic
 
02:49:09.990 --> 02:49:10.000 align:start position:0%

thank you very much mr speaker
 
02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh mr speaker this uh this bill has uh
 
02:49:31.030 --> 02:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
two mandates in one
 
02:49:33.429 --> 02:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
uh both are uh was driven by the
 
02:49:35.750 --> 02:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
hospital association and basically they
 
02:49:37.110 --> 02:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
want to make their lives a little bit
 
02:49:38.870 --> 02:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
easier so that they don't have to make
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
phone calls to the insurance companies
 
02:49:42.710 --> 02:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the patient actually
 
02:49:45.030 --> 02:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
has insurance or has the coverage that
 
02:49:47.429 --> 02:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
they're asking for prior approval on
 
02:49:49.590 --> 02:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
the three-month standard is true for all
 
02:49:51.590 --> 02:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
the states around us so there's nothing
 
02:49:54.550 --> 02:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
new there there's nothing special no
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
reason to change it and in terms of the
 
02:49:58.710 --> 02:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
transfer no that's just going to cost
 
02:50:00.710 --> 02:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
more money for the insurance so the
 
02:50:03.110 --> 02:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
commerce committee was not about to pass
 
02:50:05.110 --> 02:50:05.120 align:start position:0%
a new mandate that was just going to
 
02:50:08.150 --> 02:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
cost more premium so please support the
 
02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:13.670 align:start position:0%
cost more premium so please support the

thank you mr speaker
 
02:51:25.349 --> 02:51:25.359 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know that prior
 
02:51:27.429 --> 02:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
authorizations are usually effective for
 
02:51:29.349 --> 02:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
only three months
 
02:51:31.110 --> 02:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
if i further know it may take longer
 
02:51:32.550 --> 02:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
than three months for appointments with
 
02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
certain specialties to even be scheduled
 
02:51:37.990 --> 02:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
and if i know that
 
02:51:39.510 --> 02:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
this would ease the administrative
 
02:51:41.429 --> 02:51:41.439 align:start position:0%
burdens and thus save some health care
 
02:51:41.439 --> 02:51:42.870 align:start position:0%
burdens and thus save some health care
dollars

02:51:42.870 --> 02:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:51:44.070 --> 02:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
if i further know the new hampshire
 
02:51:46.230 --> 02:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
hospital association requested the small
 
02:51:48.150 --> 02:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
change to six months
 
02:51:49.990 --> 02:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
no change in coverage
 
02:51:52.309 --> 02:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
would i press the no button so another
 
02:51:55.590 --> 02:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
motion can be brought forward thank you

republican platform bill is only
 
02:56:29.750 --> 02:56:29.760 align:start position:0%

two to three times it's simply an
 
02:56:38.389 --> 02:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
attempt to remove a state mandate saying
 
02:56:40.469 --> 02:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
that convenience stores that sell
 
02:56:43.990 --> 02:56:44.000 align:start position:0%

heard from people who work at
 
02:57:04.550 --> 02:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
convenience stores is the state tells
 
02:57:05.670 --> 02:57:05.680 align:start position:0%

02:57:29.910 --> 02:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
tabasco sauce and put it up on the
 
02:57:31.269 --> 02:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
shelves and it sits there until it
 
02:57:33.510 --> 02:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
reaches its expiration date and then
 
02:57:35.429 --> 02:57:35.439 align:start position:0%
they throw it away and then they go back
 
02:57:36.469 --> 02:57:36.479 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:57:38.630 --> 02:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
local grocery store and they they buy
 
02:57:40.710 --> 02:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
more but they have to maintain
 
02:57:42.870 --> 02:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars of inventory the
 
02:57:44.389 --> 02:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
rule doesn't say
 
02:57:46.150 --> 02:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
that you have to sell three thousand
 
02:57:47.750 --> 02:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
dollars worth it doesn't say that you
 
02:57:49.590 --> 02:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
have to sell anything
 
02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
that anyone wants to buy in fact the
 
02:57:53.110 --> 02:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
people the convenience stores said the
 
02:57:54.630 --> 02:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
opposite they said that they don't want
 
02:57:56.230 --> 02:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
to carry anything
 
02:57:57.670 --> 02:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
that people would buy because if
 
02:57:59.190 --> 02:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
somebody bought the eight dollar box of
 
02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
fruit loops they would have to drive
 
02:58:02.389 --> 02:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
down to the the
 
02:58:03.830 --> 02:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
local grocery store and buy another
 
02:58:05.510 --> 02:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
eight dollar buck another box of fruit
 
02:58:06.950 --> 02:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
loops and put an eight dollar price tag
 
02:58:08.550 --> 02:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
on it we heard this over and over and
 
02:58:09.910 --> 02:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
over again we heard this all over the
 
02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:11.429 align:start position:0%
over again we heard this all over the
state

02:58:11.429 --> 02:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:58:12.550 --> 02:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:58:14.469 --> 02:58:14.479 align:start position:0%
it's not that every single convenience
 
02:58:16.630 --> 02:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
store is burdened by this but a lot of
 
02:58:18.790 --> 02:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
them are the republican platform
 
02:58:20.389 --> 02:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
specifically says
 
02:58:22.550 --> 02:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
one remove barriers to business
 
02:58:24.950 --> 02:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
formation so it's a republican platform
 
02:58:27.269 --> 02:58:27.279 align:start position:0%
bill and number two minimize business
 
02:58:29.190 --> 02:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
regulations permits licenses and
 
02:58:29.200 --> 02:58:30.710 align:start position:0%
regulations permits licenses and
paperwork

02:58:30.710 --> 02:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
02:58:32.389 --> 02:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
we were finally told
 
02:58:34.630 --> 02:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh during the executive session or we
 
02:58:36.389 --> 02:58:36.399 align:start position:0%
were told during the hearing that there
 
02:58:38.309 --> 02:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
were food deserts in new hampshire and
 
02:58:40.230 --> 02:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
so i asked about that we finally heard
 
02:58:42.230 --> 02:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
at the executive session that one of the
 
02:58:43.830 --> 02:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
food deserts that they were referring to
 
02:58:46.070 --> 02:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
was the city of manchester i used to
 
02:58:47.429 --> 02:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
live in manchester i lived there for
 
02:58:49.110 --> 02:58:49.120 align:start position:0%
years they were
 
02:58:50.550 --> 02:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
one of the great things about manchester
 
02:58:52.230 --> 02:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
is you can go out almost any time day or
 
02:58:55.750 --> 02:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
night for a walk uh if you're armed it's
 
02:58:57.269 --> 02:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
gotten kind of dangerous
 
02:58:58.150 --> 02:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:59:00.070 --> 02:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
not to not to be glib but the murder
 
02:59:03.190 --> 02:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
rate went up while i was living there
 
02:59:06.950 --> 02:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
it did it went to 12 murders a year
 
02:59:08.630 --> 02:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order that's why i
 
02:59:10.469 --> 02:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
bought a gun
 
02:59:13.030 --> 02:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
okay anyway
 
02:59:14.950 --> 02:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying you could go out in
 
02:59:17.030 --> 02:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
manchester and you could buy food day or
 
02:59:19.830 --> 02:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
night sorry to get off topic mr speaker
 
02:59:21.750 --> 02:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative the representative that
 
02:59:24.630 --> 02:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
that i i truly believe that that past
 
02:59:26.870 --> 02:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
comment was out of line
 
02:59:29.190 --> 02:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
okay i like i say i apologize for making
 
02:59:31.190 --> 02:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
that comment i was going off topic
 
02:59:32.790 --> 02:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
but but the point is that in the city of
 
02:59:34.469 --> 02:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
manchester you there's no food desert
 
02:59:38.710 --> 02:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
you can go walk anywhere and buy food
 
02:59:41.670 --> 02:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
anytime day or night
 
02:59:44.070 --> 02:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
so i felt that this byzantine rule we've
 
02:59:45.349 --> 02:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill a couple of times
 
02:59:45.359 --> 02:59:46.389 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill a couple of times
before

02:59:46.389 --> 02:59:46.399 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:59:48.870 --> 02:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
in both cases uh the vast majority of
 
02:59:50.710 --> 02:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
republicans on commerce committee voted
 
02:59:53.670 --> 02:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
to repeal this in both previous cases
 
02:59:55.510 --> 02:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of republicans on the
 
02:59:58.150 --> 02:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
floor of the house voted to repeal this
 
03:00:00.389 --> 03:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
i don't see any reason to do a refer for
 
03:00:01.750 --> 03:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
interim study what are you going to
 
03:00:03.190 --> 03:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
study if we're only talking about
 
03:00:04.550 --> 03:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
repealing four
 
03:00:07.190 --> 03:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
four words in statute and we know that
 
03:00:09.670 --> 03:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
when you repeal four words the remaining
 
03:00:12.469 --> 03:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
words in rsa 175 section 1 would be in
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
place so i'm asking you to press the the
 
03:00:17.269 --> 03:00:17.279 align:start position:0%

uh mr speaker if i know that
 
03:02:15.510 --> 03:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
not only existing convenience stores but
 
03:02:17.510 --> 03:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
any proposed convenience stores would
 
03:02:19.110 --> 03:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
have to comply with this mandate to
 
03:02:22.469 --> 03:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
carry three thousand dollars worth of
 
03:02:24.790 --> 03:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
you know dusty cans of everything and
 
03:02:26.710 --> 03:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
boxes of fruit loops and if i know that
 
03:02:28.309 --> 03:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
the republican party has always stood
 
03:02:31.269 --> 03:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
for less regulation less red tape less
 
03:02:31.279 --> 03:02:32.950 align:start position:0%
for less regulation less red tape less
bureaucracy

03:02:32.950 --> 03:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy
 
03:02:35.670 --> 03:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
and reducing the burden on business and
 
03:02:37.190 --> 03:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
if i know that the biggest objection
 
03:02:39.990 --> 03:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
that was raised by the other side was
 
03:02:41.990 --> 03:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
that new convenience stores might open
 
03:02:44.710 --> 03:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
up if this restriction is lifted which i
 
03:02:46.150 --> 03:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
i think that we're supposed to be a
 
03:02:48.790 --> 03:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
business friendly state and uh that's
 
03:02:51.590 --> 03:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
about 70 percent of our our state's tax
 
03:02:53.269 --> 03:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
burden comes from business taxes that we
 
03:02:54.630 --> 03:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
want more businesses moving here and
 
03:02:57.830 --> 03:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
creating jobs yes it's a
 
03:03:00.630 --> 03:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
would i then press the red button
 
03:03:03.990 --> 03:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
and so another motion can be made
 
03:03:05.510 --> 03:03:05.520 align:start position:0%

mr speaker
 
03:07:52.630 --> 03:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
i rise in opposition to the pending
 
03:07:55.590 --> 03:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
motion of an expedient to legislate on
 
03:07:58.469 --> 03:07:58.479 align:start position:0%
house bills 472.
 
03:08:02.950 --> 03:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
h.b 472 known as a clawback bill
 
03:08:05.429 --> 03:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
deals with the retroactive denial of
 
03:08:08.790 --> 03:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
accident and health insurance claims
 
03:08:11.429 --> 03:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
such denial occurs after a patient has
 
03:08:12.790 --> 03:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
been treated
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
and an insurer has paid the claim filed
 
03:08:17.269 --> 03:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
by the health care provider
 
03:08:19.990 --> 03:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
yet the patient was not covered by that
 
03:08:23.110 --> 03:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
insurer at the time of treatment
 
03:08:25.190 --> 03:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
the health care provider likely did
 
03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
check and confirm the patient's coverage
 
03:08:29.429 --> 03:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
by that insurer
 
03:08:32.389 --> 03:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
yet due to a change of employment or if
 
03:08:34.630 --> 03:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
insurance for example
 
03:08:36.870 --> 03:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
the patient was not actually covered by
 
03:08:39.190 --> 03:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
that insurance insurer at that time of
 
03:08:41.590 --> 03:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
payment treatment excuse me at that time
 
03:08:43.269 --> 03:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
of treatment
 
03:08:45.510 --> 03:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
the insurance provider having already
 
03:08:46.790 --> 03:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
paid the claim
 
03:08:49.670 --> 03:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
would then claw back the payment amount
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
from the health care provider and by
 
03:08:55.750 --> 03:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
current law has 12 months to do so
 
03:08:57.670 --> 03:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
in that 12 months
 
03:08:59.590 --> 03:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
the health care provider may have paid
 
03:09:02.950 --> 03:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
mortgage utilities whatever bills
 
03:09:05.429 --> 03:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
only to possibly lose some of the income
 
03:09:08.870 --> 03:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
that was earned and spent
 
03:09:11.510 --> 03:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
this can be especially devastating to a
 
03:09:14.469 --> 03:09:14.479 align:start position:0%
health care practitioner in a solo or
 
03:09:16.469 --> 03:09:16.479 align:start position:0%
small practice
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
the insurance provider though likely has
 
03:09:21.510 --> 03:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
greater staff and resources and should
 
03:09:23.990 --> 03:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
be able to find the payment error in
 
03:09:26.150 --> 03:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
less than a year
 
03:09:27.990 --> 03:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
you will likely hear that the time
 
03:09:30.630 --> 03:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
period for denial of previously paid
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
claims was reduced from 18 months to 12
 
03:09:36.870 --> 03:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
a session ago
 
03:09:38.630 --> 03:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
that is true
 
03:09:41.110 --> 03:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
and the change was in recognition of the
 
03:09:43.910 --> 03:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
unfairness of a long period for an
 
03:09:46.150 --> 03:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
insurance clawback
 
03:09:48.790 --> 03:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
a full year is still simply a very long
 
03:09:51.670 --> 03:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
time during which an insurance provider
 
03:09:53.830 --> 03:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
is allowed to take a payment back from a
 
03:09:55.750 --> 03:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare provider
 
03:09:57.910 --> 03:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
a healthcare provider who with due
 
03:10:00.070 --> 03:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
diligence and checking beforehand
 
03:10:02.389 --> 03:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
provided services
 
03:10:04.229 --> 03:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
and of course the health care provider
 
03:10:06.469 --> 03:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
is then faced with attempting to track
 
03:10:08.550 --> 03:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
down the party liable
 
03:10:10.950 --> 03:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
for payment of those services that may
 
03:10:12.389 --> 03:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
have been rendered more than a year
 
03:10:12.399 --> 03:10:14.150 align:start position:0%
have been rendered more than a year
before

03:10:14.150 --> 03:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
before
 
03:10:16.950 --> 03:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
hp 472 if passed would shorten the
 
03:10:20.150 --> 03:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
period for such retroactive denial to
 
03:10:21.990 --> 03:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
six months
 
03:10:24.389 --> 03:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
now especially with covert further
 
03:10:26.710 --> 03:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
exacerbating our health care
 
03:10:28.950 --> 03:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
and creating and multiplying mental
 
03:10:31.429 --> 03:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
health care issues especially among
 
03:10:31.439 --> 03:10:32.550 align:start position:0%
health care issues especially among
children

03:10:32.550 --> 03:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:10:35.269 --> 03:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
a 12-month claw back period has the
 
03:10:37.269 --> 03:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
potential to contribute to health care
 
03:10:39.910 --> 03:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
providers leaving their fields or
 
03:10:42.150 --> 03:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
leaving small practices
 
03:10:44.550 --> 03:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
or even changing to self-pay no
 
03:10:47.510 --> 03:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
insurance accepted practices
 
03:10:51.110 --> 03:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
passing hb 472 can be part of an easy
 
03:10:53.349 --> 03:10:53.359 align:start position:0%
and fair fix
 
03:10:55.429 --> 03:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
in reference to this bill the house
 
03:10:57.429 --> 03:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
calendar states quote
 
03:11:00.550 --> 03:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
none other than the sponsor of this bill
 
03:11:03.030 --> 03:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
claimed any need to further reduce the
 
03:11:05.190 --> 03:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
time end quote
 
03:11:07.990 --> 03:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
however on just the blue sheet alone
 
03:11:08.830 --> 03:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
there were
 
03:11:13.229 --> 03:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
239 side ins in support of passage of hb
 
03:11:17.830 --> 03:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
472 which reduces the time to six months
 
03:11:20.950 --> 03:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
there is a need for this bill's passage
 
03:11:23.269 --> 03:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
i ask that this body vote no on the
 
03:11:25.269 --> 03:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
pending itl motion
 
03:11:27.670 --> 03:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
in order to allow another motion to be
 
03:11:30.710 --> 03:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
made thank you

you mr speaker mr speaker and members of

the house the majority of the commerce
 
03:11:40.389 --> 03:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
committee has determined that house bill
 
03:11:43.429 --> 03:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
472 is inexpedient to legislate because
 
03:11:47.269 --> 03:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
rsa 415 section 6i was recently amended
 
03:11:49.030 --> 03:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
to reduce the allowable period for a
 
03:11:51.990 --> 03:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
retroactive denial from 18 months down
 
03:11:54.630 --> 03:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
to 12 months and this change
 
03:11:58.870 --> 03:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
just took effect january 1st 2019
 
03:12:00.790 --> 03:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
no one provided any compelling reason
 
03:12:02.710 --> 03:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
for any further changes
 
03:12:05.349 --> 03:12:05.359 align:start position:0%
and the 12-month period for retroactive
 
03:12:05.359 --> 03:12:06.550 align:start position:0%
and the 12-month period for retroactive
uh

03:12:06.550 --> 03:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:12:06.560 --> 03:12:07.910 align:start position:0%
uh
denials

03:12:07.910 --> 03:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
denials
 
03:12:09.750 --> 03:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
matches what is allowed in all the
 
03:12:11.910 --> 03:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
states that surrounds new hampshire and
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
there just really is no need for
 
03:12:16.070 --> 03:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
any further reduction in the clawback
 
03:12:17.990 --> 03:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
time so given that there is no
 
03:12:19.830 --> 03:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
compelling need to revisit this period
 
03:12:21.830 --> 03:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
for retroactive denials the majority
 
03:12:23.750 --> 03:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
recommends house bill 472 be found

03:13:57.990 --> 03:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
or some gathering
 
03:13:59.510 --> 03:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
and someone asked me what i did for a
 
03:14:00.950 --> 03:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
living as soon as i said i was in
 
03:14:03.750 --> 03:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
insurance it was often a silence and a
 
03:14:05.429 --> 03:14:05.439 align:start position:0%
change of subject
 
03:14:05.439 --> 03:14:06.790 align:start position:0%
change of subject
however

03:14:06.790 --> 03:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:14:08.710 --> 03:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
by the end of the event so often i would
 
03:14:10.229 --> 03:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
be approached with a question about
 
03:14:10.239 --> 03:14:11.269 align:start position:0%
be approached with a question about
insurance

03:14:11.269 --> 03:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:14:12.950 --> 03:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
because lots of people don't understand
 
03:14:12.960 --> 03:14:13.830 align:start position:0%
because lots of people don't understand
it

03:14:13.830 --> 03:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:14:15.590 --> 03:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes the argument is that you don't
 
03:14:18.070 --> 03:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
need it until you need it
 
03:14:19.990 --> 03:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
this is a republican-sponsored bill
 
03:14:22.389 --> 03:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
including sponsors from salem
 
03:14:24.469 --> 03:14:24.479 align:start position:0%
this bill came before us last term as
 
03:14:26.790 --> 03:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
well it was brought before us after two
 
03:14:26.800 --> 03:14:27.910 align:start position:0%
well it was brought before us after two
separate

03:14:27.910 --> 03:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
separate
 
03:14:30.950 --> 03:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
devastating fires in their town
 
03:14:32.870 --> 03:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
the apartments in which these families
 
03:14:34.710 --> 03:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
lived were total losses and none of the
 
03:14:36.710 --> 03:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
residents had renters insurance to cover
 
03:14:38.550 --> 03:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
the loss of their belongings
 
03:14:40.229 --> 03:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
or the additional living expense the
 
03:14:42.790 --> 03:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
additional cost to live elsewhere
 
03:14:44.950 --> 03:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony both years from the
 
03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
sponsors that the tenants didn't even
 
03:14:48.870 --> 03:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
know about renters insurance
 
03:14:50.790 --> 03:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
this is a terrible experience not only
 
03:14:52.070 --> 03:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
for the tenants but also for the
 
03:14:54.870 --> 03:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
landlords and the town
 
03:14:57.030 --> 03:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
these families lost everything and had
 
03:14:58.870 --> 03:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
nowhere to go
 
03:15:00.469 --> 03:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
who helps them when something like this
 
03:15:00.479 --> 03:15:01.830 align:start position:0%
who helps them when something like this
happens

03:15:01.830 --> 03:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
happens
 
03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
oh yes the first couple of weeks there
 
03:15:04.630 --> 03:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
may be
 
03:15:06.389 --> 03:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
gracious and generous townspeople who
 
03:15:08.550 --> 03:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
might have a spaghetti dinner or put out
 
03:15:10.389 --> 03:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
jars in local stores to try to do
 
03:15:11.910 --> 03:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
something for them
 
03:15:13.990 --> 03:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
there might even be a gofundme page on
 
03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:15.590 align:start position:0%
there might even be a gofundme page on
facebook

03:15:15.590 --> 03:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
facebook
 
03:15:17.830 --> 03:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
however when there are so many without
 
03:15:19.590 --> 03:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
homes or belongings these families will
 
03:15:22.229 --> 03:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
have to rely on the towns and cities
 
03:15:24.630 --> 03:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
human services departments
 
03:15:27.269 --> 03:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
in small towns this is very difficult on
 
03:15:30.150 --> 03:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
the budgets and other residents
 
03:15:31.990 --> 03:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
as these families look for a new place
 
03:15:33.750 --> 03:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
to live can you imagine that they need
 
03:15:36.150 --> 03:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
to continue to work and go to school at
 
03:15:37.910 --> 03:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
03:15:39.910 --> 03:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
or maybe not
 
03:15:41.590 --> 03:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if most people in this
 
03:15:43.510 --> 03:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
room understand that a landlord's
 
03:15:43.520 --> 03:15:44.630 align:start position:0%
room understand that a landlord's
insurance

03:15:44.630 --> 03:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:15:46.950 --> 03:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
does not and cannot cover the tenant's
 
03:15:49.190 --> 03:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
property uh the member will suspend for
 
03:15:49.200 --> 03:15:50.630 align:start position:0%
property uh the member will suspend for
a minute

03:15:50.630 --> 03:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
a minute
 
03:15:53.269 --> 03:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
it's getting awful loud in here we've
 
03:15:54.550 --> 03:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
asked before
 
03:15:56.229 --> 03:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
if you're going to have a conversation
 
03:15:58.229 --> 03:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
take it out into the hallway the member
 
03:16:00.389 --> 03:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
has a right to be heard as all members
 
03:16:02.630 --> 03:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
do thank you
 
03:16:07.510 --> 03:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:09.030 --> 03:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if most people in this
 
03:16:10.550 --> 03:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
room understand that a landlord's
 
03:16:12.630 --> 03:16:12.640 align:start position:0%
insurance cannot does not and cannot
 
03:16:14.630 --> 03:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
cover the tenant's property
 
03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
unless there is gross negligence on the
 
03:16:17.830 --> 03:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
landlord's part where there would be
 
03:16:17.840 --> 03:16:19.030 align:start position:0%
landlord's part where there would be
liability

03:16:19.030 --> 03:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
liability
 
03:16:21.030 --> 03:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
the landlord has no insurable interest
 
03:16:22.950 --> 03:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
in the tenant's property
 
03:16:25.190 --> 03:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
i can't buy an insurance policy to cover
 
03:16:26.630 --> 03:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
your property
 
03:16:28.790 --> 03:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
the landlord is also not responsible for
 
03:16:30.229 --> 03:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
finding the tenants another place to
 
03:16:30.239 --> 03:16:31.190 align:start position:0%
finding the tenants another place to
live

03:16:31.190 --> 03:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
live
 
03:16:32.630 --> 03:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
or to pay for the additional living
 
03:16:34.389 --> 03:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
expense such as hotel or restaurant
 
03:16:34.399 --> 03:16:35.750 align:start position:0%
expense such as hotel or restaurant
costs

03:16:35.750 --> 03:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:16:38.389 --> 03:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
this bill is very simple
 
03:16:41.030 --> 03:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
all it would be all it would do would be
 
03:16:43.750 --> 03:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
to notify a tenant in any written rental
 
03:16:45.990 --> 03:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
agreement that the landlord cannot
 
03:16:47.830 --> 03:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
provide renters insurance
 
03:16:49.269 --> 03:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
and that they may want to purchase it
 
03:16:50.630 --> 03:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
for themselves
 
03:16:51.670 --> 03:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
03:16:53.750 --> 03:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
there are no mandates just a very simple
 
03:16:53.760 --> 03:16:54.870 align:start position:0%
there are no mandates just a very simple
statement

03:16:54.870 --> 03:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
statement
 
03:16:56.790 --> 03:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
as most rentals are written agreements
 
03:16:58.469 --> 03:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
these days and there's a great deal of
 
03:17:00.309 --> 03:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
detail to protect the landlord in each
 
03:17:00.319 --> 03:17:01.510 align:start position:0%
detail to protect the landlord in each
agreement

03:17:01.510 --> 03:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
03:17:03.429 --> 03:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
this is just a clause that would protect
 
03:17:06.070 --> 03:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
both parties to the contract
 
03:17:08.229 --> 03:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
i'm guessing that some of you present
 
03:17:10.150 --> 03:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
either own real estate property or may
 
03:17:12.870 --> 03:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
rent an apartment i also would like to
 
03:17:14.790 --> 03:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
think that each of you who is a landlord
 
03:17:16.630 --> 03:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
cares about your tenants
 
03:17:19.429 --> 03:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
and in the event of a catastrophic fire
 
03:17:21.910 --> 03:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
water damage claim wind damage or other
 
03:17:25.349 --> 03:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
kind of loss what would you do
 
03:17:27.429 --> 03:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
renters insurance is not an expensive
 
03:17:27.439 --> 03:17:28.630 align:start position:0%
renters insurance is not an expensive
policy

03:17:28.630 --> 03:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:17:30.229 --> 03:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
nothing like the cost of insuring a
 
03:17:31.910 --> 03:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
building or a home
 
03:17:33.349 --> 03:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
for about the cost of a couple of
 
03:17:35.030 --> 03:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
coffees per month
 
03:17:36.790 --> 03:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
tenants would have peace of mind knowing
 
03:17:37.990 --> 03:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
that they would have coverage in the
 
03:17:39.830 --> 03:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
event of a loss
 
03:17:42.469 --> 03:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
this bill would simply notify the tenant
 
03:17:44.070 --> 03:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
that they should consider purchasing
 
03:17:46.229 --> 03:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
renters insurance
 
03:17:48.710 --> 03:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
oh i know the argument might be
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
that it's the responsibility of the
 
03:17:51.990 --> 03:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
tenant to understand their exposure but
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
there's no easy way for people to
 
03:17:57.030 --> 03:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
educate anyone about insurance
 
03:17:58.710 --> 03:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
if it was right in the rental agreement
 
03:18:00.229 --> 03:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
the renters would at least know they'd
 
03:18:01.429 --> 03:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
been told
 
03:18:02.950 --> 03:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
and if they chose not to buy it then
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's their decision
 
03:18:06.710 --> 03:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
please consider voting against the
 
03:18:08.309 --> 03:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
committee's recommendations so another
 
03:18:10.469 --> 03:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
motion can be brought forward and thanks
 
03:18:12.469 --> 03:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
for caring
 
03:18:14.150 --> 03:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative hunt
 
03:18:16.070 --> 03:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
to speak for the committee report
 
03:18:17.990 --> 03:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
03:18:19.510 --> 03:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
so this was an interesting one for the
 
03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
commerce committee because uh in the
 
03:18:24.870 --> 03:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
past we have been the ones that
 
03:18:27.670 --> 03:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
required on purchases sales agreements
 
03:18:29.510 --> 03:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
when you buy a property
 
03:18:32.229 --> 03:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
that there are some set pieces in there
 
03:18:35.190 --> 03:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
are required to be disclosed
 
03:18:37.190 --> 03:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
so we tro we took this bill as sort of
 
03:18:40.150 --> 03:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
like okay how do we get that disclosure
 
03:18:42.870 --> 03:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
occurred a purchase sale agreement is a
 
03:18:44.950 --> 03:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
written document that has to be you know
 
03:18:46.550 --> 03:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
done ahead of time
 
03:18:50.389 --> 03:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
and there is a form by the mls that that
 
03:18:52.070 --> 03:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
is a standard form for purchases of
 
03:18:52.080 --> 03:18:53.269 align:start position:0%
is a standard form for purchases of
training

03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:18:56.550 --> 03:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
so we then went about to see was there a
 
03:18:58.710 --> 03:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
form out there
 
03:19:00.790 --> 03:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
for rentals
 
03:19:02.389 --> 03:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
was there a landlord was there
 
03:19:04.790 --> 03:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
association was anything about we could
 
03:19:06.150 --> 03:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
not find one
 
03:19:09.750 --> 03:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
so in lack of finding any proper form to
 
03:19:11.110 --> 03:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
have someone
 
03:19:13.670 --> 03:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
have this sentence inserted
 
03:19:15.910 --> 03:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
it then comes down to
 
03:19:19.110 --> 03:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
how many people really truly don't know
 
03:19:20.710 --> 03:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
that in new hampshire
 
03:19:25.030 --> 03:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
you don't have to buy auto insurance
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:19:28.550 --> 03:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
you don't have to buy
 
03:19:31.590 --> 03:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
tenant insurance
 
03:19:32.710 --> 03:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
03:19:34.710 --> 03:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
make statues trying to tell people to
 
03:19:36.150 --> 03:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
educate people
 
03:19:38.710 --> 03:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
frankly i thought this was an incredible
 
03:19:41.510 --> 03:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
sales opportunity for every landlord to
 
03:19:44.070 --> 03:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
at least or for insurance agents to get
 
03:19:46.309 --> 03:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
the landlords to hand them a form and
 
03:19:48.870 --> 03:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
say you should get insurance we passed
 
03:19:51.269 --> 03:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
legislation last year to allow
 
03:19:53.349 --> 03:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
storage use storage buildings to
 
03:19:55.670 --> 03:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
actually pass out a little pamphlet and
 
03:19:58.389 --> 03:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
urge people to get insurance for those
 
03:20:00.790 --> 03:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
storage facilities the proper way of
 
03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
doing this is let the free market solve
 
03:20:05.030 --> 03:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
this problem we do not need this
 
03:20:05.040 --> 03:20:12.830 align:start position:0%
this problem we do not need this
legislation

03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:15.590 --> 03:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
question where
 
03:20:15.600 --> 03:20:17.670 align:start position:0%
question where
oh

03:20:17.670 --> 03:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:20:19.670 --> 03:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
question for the
 
03:20:22.070 --> 03:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
does a member yield to a question sure
 
03:20:24.630 --> 03:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
remember yields you may inquire
 
03:20:24.640 --> 03:20:25.670 align:start position:0%
remember yields you may inquire
okay

03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:20:28.309 --> 03:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
i have a very very simple question for
 
03:20:32.630 --> 03:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
your very complex explanation which is
 
03:20:34.229 --> 03:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
would it cost
 
03:20:37.830 --> 03:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
the owner of the rental property owner
 
03:20:39.750 --> 03:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
more than a penny
 
03:20:42.389 --> 03:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
to hand his rental
 
03:20:42.399 --> 03:20:43.830 align:start position:0%
to hand his rental
person

03:20:43.830 --> 03:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:20:45.590 --> 03:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
the renter
 
03:20:48.309 --> 03:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
a piece of paper that simply says
 
03:20:50.150 --> 03:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
i am not responsible for your
 
03:20:50.160 --> 03:20:51.670 align:start position:0%
i am not responsible for your
possessions

03:20:51.670 --> 03:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
possessions
 
03:20:51.680 --> 03:20:52.630 align:start position:0%
possessions
so

03:20:52.630 --> 03:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:20:55.590 --> 03:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
if you want insurance
 
03:20:58.790 --> 03:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:01.750 --> 03:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh well here's the thing
 
03:21:03.830 --> 03:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
the problem with the bill is it says
 
03:21:06.630 --> 03:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
only if there is a written lease
 
03:21:08.870 --> 03:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure i want to be able to try
 
03:21:11.190 --> 03:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
to incentivize landlords not to have a
 
03:21:12.710 --> 03:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
written lease so they don't have to be
 
03:21:15.510 --> 03:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
worried about what state laws they
 
03:21:17.349 --> 03:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
needed to write into this lease or not
 
03:21:17.359 --> 03:21:18.229 align:start position:0%
needed to write into this lease or not
lease

03:21:18.229 --> 03:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
lease
 
03:21:20.550 --> 03:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
the issue is there's nothing stopping a
 
03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
landlord now to inform
 
03:21:25.349 --> 03:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
consumers inform their tenants that they
 
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
need to get insurance just like we all
 
03:21:29.990 --> 03:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
know that we probably need auto
 
03:21:31.750 --> 03:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
insurance even though that's not
 
03:21:33.910 --> 03:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory either
 
03:21:33.920 --> 03:21:35.030 align:start position:0%
mandatory either
follow-up

03:21:35.030 --> 03:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:21:36.229 --> 03:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
does the member yield to another
 
03:21:36.239 --> 03:21:37.429 align:start position:0%
does the member yield to another
question

03:21:37.429 --> 03:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:43.439 --> 03:21:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:21:44.150 --> 03:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:21:47.030 --> 03:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
question before us on house bill 473 is
 
03:21:48.950 --> 03:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
the majority report of inexpediting to
 
03:21:48.960 --> 03:21:51.590 align:start position:0%
the majority report of inexpediting to
legislate

03:21:51.590 --> 03:21:51.600 align:start position:0%

03:21:59.349 --> 03:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
division has been called members take
 
03:22:00.950 --> 03:22:00.960 align:start position:0%

03:23:05.520 --> 03:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:23:27.830 --> 03:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:27.840 --> 03:23:40.870 align:start position:0%
 
oh

uh thank you mr chairman uh it's
 
03:24:03.030 --> 03:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
actually chris mcaleer appreciate it
 
03:24:05.110 --> 03:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh mr speaker
 
03:24:07.830 --> 03:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
if i know that people have perceptions
 
03:24:07.840 --> 03:24:08.870 align:start position:0%
if i know that people have perceptions
different

03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
both positive and negative based on
 
03:24:12.550 --> 03:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
certain clues
 
03:24:14.950 --> 03:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
and how they interpret these clues
 
03:24:16.870 --> 03:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
would i not give you an example of that
 
03:24:18.389 --> 03:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:24:20.870 --> 03:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
now i don't want anybody to raise their
 
03:24:20.880 --> 03:24:21.990 align:start position:0%
now i don't want anybody to raise their
hand

03:24:21.990 --> 03:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
hand
 
03:24:24.830 --> 03:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
but how many smokers do we have out
 
03:24:28.389 --> 03:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
there that's that's that isn't part of a
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry i'll give you
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
dollars to donuts
 
03:24:35.110 --> 03:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
that there are more ex-smokers here
 
03:24:37.910 --> 03:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
than there are current smokers in fact i
 
03:24:41.190 --> 03:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
myself have quit smoking several hundred
 
03:24:43.190 --> 03:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
represent representative this is a
 
03:24:45.030 --> 03:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
problem this is a parliamentary inquiry
 
03:24:46.389 --> 03:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
not a speech
 
03:24:48.070 --> 03:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
03:24:50.389 --> 03:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
uh if i know
 
03:24:52.150 --> 03:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
if i know that one of the small but
 
03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
nevertheless key components
 
03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
of a very successful campaign
 
03:24:59.670 --> 03:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
to discourage smoking
 
03:25:02.070 --> 03:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
was when the u.s surgeon general managed
 
03:25:03.830 --> 03:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
to get a very scary
 
03:25:05.670 --> 03:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
warning on the sides of cigarette
 
03:25:05.680 --> 03:25:06.710 align:start position:0%
warning on the sides of cigarette
packages

03:25:06.710 --> 03:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
packages
 
03:25:09.030 --> 03:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
warning of the dangers
 
03:25:10.950 --> 03:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
over time some people actually took the
 
03:25:13.750 --> 03:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
heed of this
 
03:25:13.760 --> 03:25:15.750 align:start position:0%
heed of this
representative

03:25:15.750 --> 03:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:25:17.030 --> 03:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
you're making a speech not a
 
03:25:18.790 --> 03:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
03:25:21.750 --> 03:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
well what we know and what i know is
 
03:25:24.229 --> 03:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
that that was very very effective in
 
03:25:26.790 --> 03:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
reducing smoking a matter of fact over
 
03:25:29.030 --> 03:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
the last three decades
 
03:25:32.469 --> 03:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
smoking has gone down three
 
03:25:34.630 --> 03:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
a lot until last year
 
03:25:37.910 --> 03:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
when actually smoking went up
 
03:25:40.469 --> 03:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
clearly people became informed
 
03:25:42.389 --> 03:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
of the dangers of smoking they became
 
03:25:42.399 --> 03:25:43.910 align:start position:0%
of the dangers of smoking they became
educated

03:25:43.910 --> 03:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
educated
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
smokers reacted and many of them quit
 
03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
mr speaker point of order
 
03:25:51.990 --> 03:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
if i know that the vast majority
 
03:25:55.190 --> 03:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative i i i realize
 
03:25:57.030 --> 03:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
you probably haven't done too many pi's
 
03:25:59.510 --> 03:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
no i have not
 
03:26:01.190 --> 03:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
you're not really doing a parliamentary
 
03:26:01.200 --> 03:26:03.590 align:start position:0%
you're not really doing a parliamentary
inquiry

03:26:03.590 --> 03:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
03:26:05.750 --> 03:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
so i i would ask that maybe you wrap it
 
03:26:05.760 --> 03:26:06.950 align:start position:0%
so i i would ask that maybe you wrap it
up

03:26:06.950 --> 03:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
i will wrap it up
 
03:26:12.309 --> 03:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:20.469 --> 03:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:22.150 --> 03:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
03:26:24.469 --> 03:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
that the majority of tenants do not have
 
03:26:26.710 --> 03:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
homeowners insurance and never heard of
 
03:26:28.389 --> 03:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
homeowners insurance
 
03:26:30.550 --> 03:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it make sense that we make a
 
03:26:32.950 --> 03:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
provision for them to know
 
03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that's being
 
03:26:34.560 --> 03:26:36.469 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that's being
heavy-handed

03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed
 
03:26:36.479 --> 03:26:37.590 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed
i

03:26:37.590 --> 03:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
i

the prevailing side of a question to

combine as many as six keen wards with a

in the majority plan the electoral power
 
04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
of the keen wards will effectively
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
preclude the smaller towns from any

chambers
 
04:04:34.309 --> 04:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
as there is little community of interest

between the city wards and the towns
 
04:04:40.389 --> 04:04:40.399 align:start position:0%

constitution in coast county
 
04:04:59.590 --> 04:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
by denying berlin its own dedicated

population for its own district
 
04:05:06.070 --> 04:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
berlin was entitled to three seats in
 
04:05:08.469 --> 04:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
the house based on its population
 
04:05:10.150 --> 04:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
and its population was well within the
 
04:05:12.389 --> 04:05:12.399 align:start position:0%
acceptable range of deviation for those
 
04:05:14.229 --> 04:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
three seats
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
the minority amendment complies with the
 
04:05:17.830 --> 04:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution while
 
04:05:20.309 --> 04:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
maintaining the exact same deviation as
 
04:05:23.189 --> 04:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
the majority plan
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
in grafton county the minority plan
 
04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
offers a lower range of deviation
 
04:05:29.590 --> 04:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
it creates only one floaterial district

04:05:35.189 --> 04:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
and littleton would share a district
 
04:05:37.110 --> 04:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
with only one other town
 
04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
whereas the majority plan puts littleton
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
in a six town district
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
in hillsborough county
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
the minority plan would ensure that the

34 rounded up 33 if rounded down
 
04:06:01.990 --> 04:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
the majority plan however cuts that even
 
04:06:05.349 --> 04:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
further and only gives them 32.
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
the proposal of the minority increases
 
04:06:09.189 --> 04:06:09.199 align:start position:0%

04:06:25.910 --> 04:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
amendment provides single town
 
04:06:29.110 --> 04:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
representation to eight communities
 
04:06:31.429 --> 04:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
and in rockingham county the largest

district is six
 
04:06:36.550 --> 04:06:36.560 align:start position:0%

04:06:45.429 --> 04:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
prioritizes keeping cities together in

state representative districts
 
04:06:48.469 --> 04:06:48.479 align:start position:0%

representative turcotte to speak for the
 
04:07:14.870 --> 04:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
hb 50 is a statewide redistricting plan
 
04:07:24.790 --> 04:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
and as a statewide plan it is impossible
 
04:07:26.950 --> 04:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
to achieve perfection
 
04:07:29.269 --> 04:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
our own new hampshire supreme court has
 
04:07:31.030 --> 04:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
acknowledged this stating quote
 
04:07:33.349 --> 04:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
ultimately part two
 
04:07:35.510 --> 04:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
article 11 cannot be considered in
 
04:07:35.520 --> 04:07:37.269 align:start position:0%
article 11 cannot be considered in
isolation

04:07:37.269 --> 04:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
isolation
 
04:07:39.670 --> 04:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
and it sets forth only some of several
 
04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional criteria
 
04:07:46.710 --> 04:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
that a redistricting plan must satisfy
 
04:07:48.630 --> 04:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
in 2001 the
 
04:07:51.269 --> 04:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
court has further explained
 
04:07:53.670 --> 04:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
a balance must be drawn
 
04:07:56.309 --> 04:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
trade-offs must be made
 
04:07:57.750 --> 04:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee has
 
04:07:59.990 --> 04:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
created a map that has increased the
 
04:08:03.110 --> 04:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
number of towns wards and places with
 
04:08:05.590 --> 04:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
their own representatives
 
04:08:07.550 --> 04:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
while falling within
 
04:08:09.429 --> 04:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
constitutionally permission uh
 
04:08:11.830 --> 04:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
permissible deviation
 
04:08:14.149 --> 04:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
the majority has voted avoided the
 
04:08:15.910 --> 04:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary creation of large
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
floaterials while striking a balance to
 
04:08:21.510 --> 04:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
avoid the arbitrary favoring of one town
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
over another
 
04:08:25.670 --> 04:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
the minority map fails to achieve these
 
04:08:27.750 --> 04:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
same objectives and instead favor
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
certain districts for the purpose of
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
artificially enhancing cherry-picked
 
04:08:32.640 --> 04:08:34.149 align:start position:0%
artificially enhancing cherry-picked
numbers

04:08:34.149 --> 04:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
04:08:36.790 --> 04:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
the majority plan for hb 50 meets all of
 
04:08:38.790 --> 04:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
the constitutional requirements while
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
maintaining 400 representatives in the
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
house as was unanimously
 
04:08:45.830 --> 04:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
decided by the special redistricting
 
04:08:45.840 --> 04:08:47.030 align:start position:0%
decided by the special redistricting
committee

04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:08:49.269 --> 04:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
the majority plan will constitutionally
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
and fairly represent the residents of
 
04:08:54.389 --> 04:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for the next 10 years
 
04:08:56.870 --> 04:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
the next decade
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
i therefore ask that you support the
 
04:09:01.670 --> 04:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
majority of the redistricting committee
 
04:09:04.229 --> 04:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
and reject the minority amendment
 
04:09:10.870 --> 04:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:13.189 --> 04:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
so who's going to call for a roll call
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sure this is going to be roll called
 
04:09:17.110 --> 04:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
a roll call has been requested that
 
04:09:19.110 --> 04:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded
 
04:09:20.950 --> 04:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
04:09:23.110 --> 04:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote
 
04:09:24.630 --> 04:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
members will take their seats this will
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:29.279 --> 04:09:50.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:09:50.070 --> 04:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:50.080 --> 04:10:14.229 align:start position:0%
 
rocole

04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:14.239 --> 04:10:45.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:10:45.349 --> 04:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
members will take their seats this would
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:12.000 --> 04:11:21.189 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:11:21.189 --> 04:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:24.389 --> 04:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
the house will come to order
 
04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
 
04:11:28.630 --> 04:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative weber for a parliamentary
 
04:11:28.640 --> 04:11:33.269 align:start position:0%

04:11:35.990 --> 04:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
04:11:41.910 --> 04:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
that when i looked at the maps
 
04:11:45.189 --> 04:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
contrary to what you have just
 
04:11:49.349 --> 04:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
well let me start again if i know that
 
04:11:51.349 --> 04:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
when the minority
 
04:11:53.670 --> 04:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
made their plan
 
04:11:56.790 --> 04:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
contrary to what was just represented
 
04:11:56.800 --> 04:11:58.790 align:start position:0%
contrary to what was just represented
represented

04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
represented
 
04:12:02.070 --> 04:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
we took as our first principle to try
 
04:12:05.030 --> 04:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
and get the most local representation
 
04:12:05.040 --> 04:12:07.309 align:start position:0%
and get the most local representation
possible

04:12:07.309 --> 04:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
irrespective of whether
 
04:12:13.590 --> 04:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
that would damage an incumbent be it
 
04:12:16.229 --> 04:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
democratic or republican we tried to
 
04:12:18.469 --> 04:12:18.479 align:start position:0%
follow the principles that we hoped an
 
04:12:20.469 --> 04:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
independent redistricting commission
 
04:12:22.710 --> 04:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
would follow
 
04:12:25.269 --> 04:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
if i know that in looking at the maps
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
the minorities submitted
 
04:12:32.229 --> 04:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:32.239 --> 04:12:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:12:33.030 --> 04:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:37.750 --> 04:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
they result in smaller floaterials
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
and more local representation
 
04:12:43.110 --> 04:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
than the majority maps would i now
 
04:12:45.429 --> 04:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
press the green button
 
04:12:47.590 --> 04:12:47.600 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker

04:13:00.149 --> 04:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily favors certain districts to
 
04:13:02.309 --> 04:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
the detriment of others
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
and if i also know that the majority map
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
is constitutional and provides fair

and when multi-town districts are
 
04:17:41.990 --> 04:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
required base those districts on
 
04:17:44.149 --> 04:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
communities of interest
 
04:17:46.229 --> 04:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
the republican majority plan fails to do
 
04:17:48.389 --> 04:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
so and i would encourage the members to
 
04:17:50.950 --> 04:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
vote against it
 
04:17:53.110 --> 04:17:53.120 align:start position:0%

04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker

04:18:30.630 --> 04:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
as we said when we were discussing the
 
04:18:30.640 --> 04:18:31.910 align:start position:0%
as we said when we were discussing the
amendment

04:18:31.910 --> 04:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:18:35.349 --> 04:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
this bill as amended balances the
 
04:18:37.990 --> 04:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
federal and state constitutional
 
04:18:40.790 --> 04:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
requirements for redistricting
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
they must meet both the federal and the
 
04:18:46.550 --> 04:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
state requirements
 
04:18:46.560 --> 04:18:47.429 align:start position:0%
state requirements
one

04:18:47.429 --> 04:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:18:49.990 --> 04:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
part of our constitution part two
 
04:18:51.910 --> 04:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
article 11
 
04:18:55.030 --> 04:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
says when the population of any town or
 
04:18:57.670 --> 04:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
ward according to the last federal
 
04:19:01.189 --> 04:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
census is within a reasonable deviation
 
04:19:03.910 --> 04:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
from the ideal population for one or
 
04:19:07.269 --> 04:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
more representative seats the town award
 
04:19:10.389 --> 04:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
shall have its own district of one or
 
04:19:12.790 --> 04:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
more representative seats
 
04:19:14.309 --> 04:19:14.319 align:start position:0%
we heard that
 
04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
hundreds of times from people around the
 
04:19:16.640 --> 04:19:17.590 align:start position:0%
hundreds of times from people around the
state

04:19:17.590 --> 04:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
but most of them did not go on to read
 
04:19:22.389 --> 04:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
the rest of that paragraph
 
04:19:25.429 --> 04:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
which says the apportionment shall not
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
deny any other town or award membership
 
04:19:32.389 --> 04:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
in one non-floaterial representative
 
04:19:32.399 --> 04:19:34.710 align:start position:0%
in one non-floaterial representative
district

04:19:34.710 --> 04:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:19:37.510 --> 04:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
when any town ward or unincorporated
 
04:19:39.429 --> 04:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
place has fewer than the number of
 
04:19:42.389 --> 04:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
inhabitants necessary to entitle it to
 
04:19:45.830 --> 04:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
one representative the legislature shall
 
04:19:48.870 --> 04:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
form those towns wards or unincorporated
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
places into representative districts
 
04:19:53.750 --> 04:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
which contain a sufficient number of
 
04:19:57.110 --> 04:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
inhabitants to title each district so
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
formed to one or more representatives
 
04:20:01.670 --> 04:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
for the entire district
 
04:20:03.670 --> 04:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
informing the districts the boundaries
 
04:20:07.030 --> 04:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
of towns awards and an incorporate
 
04:20:09.349 --> 04:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
unincorporated places shall be preserved
 
04:20:10.950 --> 04:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
and contiguous
 
04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
the excess number of inhabitants of
 
04:20:15.670 --> 04:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
districts may be added to the excess
 
04:20:18.389 --> 04:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
number of inhabitants of other districts
 
04:20:21.910 --> 04:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
to form at large or floaterial districts
 
04:20:25.110 --> 04:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
conforming to acceptable deviations
 
04:20:27.670 --> 04:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
so it's not as simple as if you have 3
 
04:20:30.070 --> 04:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
400 rep
 
04:20:32.870 --> 04:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
residents you have your own state rep
 
04:20:35.349 --> 04:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
the state supreme court has stated that
 
04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
this cannot be considered in isolation
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
and and that there are several
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional criteria that the
 
04:20:45.750 --> 04:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
redistricting plan must satisfy
 
04:20:48.389 --> 04:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
perfection is not possible and a balance
 
04:20:51.189 --> 04:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
must be drawn
 
04:20:54.070 --> 04:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
so the majority map makes reasonable and
 
04:20:55.990 --> 04:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate trade-offs
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
not arbitrarily favoring certain
 
04:21:01.590 --> 04:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
districts to the detriment of others
 
04:21:03.429 --> 04:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
we as a committee
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
unanimously agreed to have 400
 
04:21:06.960 --> 04:21:08.870 align:start position:0%
unanimously agreed to have 400
representatives

04:21:08.870 --> 04:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
04:21:12.389 --> 04:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
we allocated those 400 representatives
 
04:21:15.030 --> 04:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
to the county so that no district will
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
cross a county line
 
04:21:19.110 --> 04:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
and then we
 
04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
develop districts
 
04:21:22.389 --> 04:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
meeting the
 
04:21:24.630 --> 04:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
normal definition of reasonable
 
04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
deviation which is 10 percent
 
04:21:31.510 --> 04:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
all districts are contiguous there's no
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
town boundaries broken every town is in
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
a non-floaterial district
 
04:21:37.199 --> 04:21:38.149 align:start position:0%
a non-floaterial district
and

04:21:38.149 --> 04:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:38.159 --> 04:21:39.030 align:start position:0%
and
that

04:21:39.030 --> 04:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:21:41.590 --> 04:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
we assume that the cities would divide
 
04:21:44.149 --> 04:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
their awards for equal populations which
 
04:21:44.159 --> 04:21:44.950 align:start position:0%
their awards for equal populations which
is

04:21:44.950 --> 04:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:21:48.389 --> 04:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:51.269 --> 04:21:51.279 align:start position:0%
and we tried to create single town
 
04:21:51.279 --> 04:21:53.910 align:start position:0%
and we tried to create single town
districts

04:21:53.910 --> 04:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:55.830 --> 04:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
but as much as possible without
 
04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
depriving another town of its fair
 
04:21:58.080 --> 04:21:59.750 align:start position:0%
depriving another town of its fair
representation

04:21:59.750 --> 04:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
representation
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
where possible we kept cities within
 
04:22:04.229 --> 04:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
their boundaries and did not share
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
districts to the adjoining towns
 
04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
and then we used literal districts to
 
04:22:11.189 --> 04:22:11.199 align:start position:0%
make sure the deviations came out
 
04:22:11.199 --> 04:22:12.550 align:start position:0%
make sure the deviations came out
correct

04:22:12.550 --> 04:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:22:15.670 --> 04:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
these maps are constitutional and they
 
04:22:17.510 --> 04:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
fairly represent the people of new
 
04:22:17.520 --> 04:22:18.790 align:start position:0%
fairly represent the people of new
hampshire

04:22:18.790 --> 04:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:22:21.429 --> 04:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
we hope that you will support them
 
04:22:28.389 --> 04:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:29.830 --> 04:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
so who's going to make the motion for a
 
04:22:31.110 --> 04:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
roll call
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
which i know was coming
 
04:22:36.790 --> 04:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
roll call is that sufficiently seconded
 
04:22:38.790 --> 04:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
04:22:42.070 --> 04:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:26.469 --> 04:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:51.030 --> 04:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:53.030 --> 04:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
members will be in their seats this is a
 
04:24:01.349 --> 04:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
espedia for a parliamentary inquiry
 
04:24:07.990 --> 04:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:24:09.990 --> 04:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
if i know that granite theaters gave
 
04:24:11.750 --> 04:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
clear direction at the redistricting
 
04:24:13.590 --> 04:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
committee's public input sessions
 
04:24:15.910 --> 04:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
requesting compact house districts that
 
04:24:17.990 --> 04:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
keep cities together and provide local
 
04:24:20.229 --> 04:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
representations to communities of
 
04:24:22.070 --> 04:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
sufficient population
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
if i know that hb 50 as amended rejects
 
04:24:27.030 --> 04:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
that public input needlessly lumping
 
04:24:28.550 --> 04:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
cities in with other communities and
 
04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
stacking towns into mega districts with
 
04:24:32.710 --> 04:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
no rational bases
 
04:24:34.309 --> 04:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
if i want to comply with the new
 
04:24:36.389 --> 04:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire constitution and provide the
 
04:24:38.229 --> 04:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
smallest most representative districts
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
possible but i now press the red button
 
04:24:44.950 --> 04:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:47.269 --> 04:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:24:52.469 --> 04:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
04:24:56.790 --> 04:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
if i know this plan meets all the
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements it's
 
04:24:59.750 --> 04:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
certainly an improvement over what we
 
04:25:01.670 --> 04:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
have now creating more single
 
04:25:03.590 --> 04:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
municipality districts
 
04:25:05.189 --> 04:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i know we even
 
04:25:08.229 --> 04:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
incorporated elements from both parties
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
into the majority committee amendment
 
04:25:15.750 --> 04:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:19.590 --> 04:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
the question before us on house bill 50
 
04:25:19.600 --> 04:25:20.710 align:start position:0%
the question before us on house bill 50
is

04:25:20.710 --> 04:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:25:22.469 --> 04:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
the majority
 
04:25:24.710 --> 04:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion as amended with the
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
majority committee report
 
04:25:31.510 --> 04:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor you'll press the
 
04:25:34.149 --> 04:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
green button if you're opposed you'll
 
04:25:36.469 --> 04:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
press the red button voting stations are
 
04:26:19.110 --> 04:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:37.269 --> 04:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:49.269 --> 04:26:49.279 align:start position:0%

i would not want to settle for half a
loaf

04:40:50.470 --> 04:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
loaf
 
04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
and therefore i would oppose
 
04:40:58.708 --> 04:40:58.718 align:start position:0%
the majority amendment on house bill 52
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
and would then vote
 
04:41:01.120 --> 04:41:02.390 align:start position:0%
and would then vote
red

04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
red
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
on the majority amendment in order to
 
04:41:08.070 --> 04:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
consider an amendment which might make
 
04:41:09.430 --> 04:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
it possible
 
04:41:11.910 --> 04:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
for my party the republican party in
 
04:41:15.030 --> 04:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
this case or the democratic party to win

04:41:25.110 --> 04:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order
 
04:41:28.230 --> 04:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's getting awful noisy again
 
04:41:29.990 --> 04:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:41:32.230 --> 04:41:32.240 align:start position:0%

thank you mr speaker
 
04:41:39.670 --> 04:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
if i know that this
 
04:41:42.550 --> 04:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
committee amendment before this body
 
04:41:45.670 --> 04:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
addresses a change that has to be made
 
04:41:48.310 --> 04:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
due to population changes over the last
 
04:41:50.708 --> 04:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
10 years and mr speaker
 
04:41:52.470 --> 04:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
if i know
 
04:41:55.270 --> 04:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
that in fact the map that is presented
 
04:41:58.550 --> 04:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
by this amendment is not
 
04:42:00.948 --> 04:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
the most partisan passable map that
 
04:42:02.788 --> 04:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
there is and apparently some people
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
don't know how to draw maps very well
 
04:42:06.868 --> 04:42:06.878 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
04:42:08.470 --> 04:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
04:42:10.390 --> 04:42:10.400 align:start position:0%

04:42:12.390 --> 04:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
that the map before
 
04:42:16.470 --> 04:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
this body will in this amendment 2271
 
04:42:19.350 --> 04:42:19.360 align:start position:0%

from 1880 until now in new hampshire
 
04:46:09.190 --> 04:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
there have been two congressional
 
04:46:12.070 --> 04:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
districts and the basic map has stayed
 
04:46:14.628 --> 04:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
the same
 
04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the second district republicans won
 
04:46:20.390 --> 04:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
71 times and democrats
 
04:46:23.590 --> 04:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
15 in the last 86
 
04:46:23.600 --> 04:46:25.590 align:start position:0%
15 in the last 86
elections

04:46:25.590 --> 04:46:25.600 align:start position:0%
elections
 
04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
the first district changed hands in six
 
04:46:31.030 --> 04:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
of the last eight elections with
 
04:46:34.390 --> 04:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
incumbents losing in five of those races
 
04:46:37.270 --> 04:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has predominantly leaned
 
04:46:37.280 --> 04:46:38.788 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has predominantly leaned
republican

04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
republican
 
04:46:40.868 --> 04:46:40.878 align:start position:0%
state elections have frequently been
 
04:46:43.830 --> 04:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
purple with a healthy party mixture of
 
04:46:45.990 --> 04:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
governor state house senate and u.s
 
04:46:48.230 --> 04:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
house and senate
 
04:46:50.788 --> 04:46:50.798 align:start position:0%

vote for the candidate they prefer
 
04:46:55.830 --> 04:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
without necessarily following
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
party lines
 
04:46:57.840 --> 04:46:59.430 align:start position:0%
party lines
under

04:46:59.430 --> 04:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:47:01.150 --> 04:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
federal and state
 
04:47:03.590 --> 04:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional and
 
04:47:05.350 --> 04:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
legal requirements
 
04:47:06.948 --> 04:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
we need to have
 
04:47:10.230 --> 04:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
two equal districts from the current
 
04:47:10.240 --> 04:47:12.070 align:start position:0%
two equal districts from the current
census

04:47:12.070 --> 04:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
census
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire congressional
 
04:47:14.160 --> 04:47:16.070 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire congressional
seats

04:47:16.070 --> 04:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
seats
 
04:47:23.590 --> 04:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:26.550 --> 04:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
citizens so once the new census figures
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
came back all we had to do
 
04:47:32.788 --> 04:47:32.798 align:start position:0%
was move nine thousand people from the
 
04:47:34.708 --> 04:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
first district
 
04:47:37.110 --> 04:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
into the second district
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
we didn't have to really shake
 
04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
everything up we didn't have to change
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
things in any dramatic way
 
04:47:46.070 --> 04:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
moving nine thousand people
 
04:47:48.628 --> 04:47:48.638 align:start position:0%
would give us two districts with equal
 
04:47:48.638 --> 04:47:50.150 align:start position:0%
would give us two districts with equal
population

04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:47:54.070 --> 04:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
and in fact that is what the minority
 
04:47:57.030 --> 04:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
amendment does it moves only nine
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
thousand people from the first district
 
04:48:01.110 --> 04:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
into the second
 
04:48:03.910 --> 04:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
this differs from the amendment that at
 
04:48:05.350 --> 04:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
04:48:07.750 --> 04:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
this house has passed but there's still
 
04:48:10.230 --> 04:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
time to correct the mistake
 
04:48:16.788 --> 04:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
of the total population of the state
 
04:48:21.430 --> 04:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
from one district
 
04:48:22.948 --> 04:48:22.958 align:start position:0%
to another
 
04:48:24.550 --> 04:48:24.560 align:start position:0%
for no
 
04:48:27.990 --> 04:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:31.830 --> 04:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
in two days of public hearings only one
 
04:48:31.840 --> 04:48:32.868 align:start position:0%
in two days of public hearings only one
person

04:48:32.868 --> 04:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:48:36.150 --> 04:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
testified in favor of the majority
 
04:48:36.160 --> 04:48:37.350 align:start position:0%
testified in favor of the majority
amendment

04:48:37.350 --> 04:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
and his thoughtful reasoned presentation
 
04:48:44.470 --> 04:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
was that this amendment would help the
 
04:48:48.628 --> 04:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
incumbents gain seniority in washington
 
04:48:48.638 --> 04:48:50.150 align:start position:0%
incumbents gain seniority in washington
and

04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:52.470 --> 04:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
and he thought that was important
 
04:48:55.430 --> 04:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
it is important if what you believe is
 
04:48:57.750 --> 04:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
protecting incumbency
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's not important if what you believe
 
04:49:04.150 --> 04:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
is making sure that citizens have the
 
04:49:07.350 --> 04:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
right every two years to choose the
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
person they want to lead
 
04:49:11.750 --> 04:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
that is the strength of the new
 
04:49:13.190 --> 04:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire public
 
04:49:15.110 --> 04:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh political system
 
04:49:17.190 --> 04:49:17.200 align:start position:0%

i'm specifically addressing some of the
 
04:50:33.590 --> 04:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
complaints raised by the minority of the
 
04:50:33.600 --> 04:50:34.628 align:start position:0%
complaints raised by the minority of the
committee

04:50:34.628 --> 04:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:50:37.510 --> 04:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
the minority moved one town that town
 
04:50:39.190 --> 04:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
happened to be one of the most
 
04:50:42.150 --> 04:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
republican towns in the state why is
 
04:50:44.470 --> 04:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
that important mr speaker because while
 
04:50:46.868 --> 04:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
the minority of the committee speaks of
 
04:50:49.430 --> 04:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
fairness of the current districts they
 
04:50:53.110 --> 04:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
have won 90 of the contests under the
 
04:50:54.788 --> 04:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
current map
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
that is not purple mr speaker one drop
 
04:51:00.390 --> 04:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
of red and nine drops of blue is not
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
purple it's just blue
 
04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
furthermore mr speaker
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
the majority map did a better job of
 
04:51:07.600 --> 04:51:08.868 align:start position:0%
the majority map did a better job of
preserving

04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
preserving
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
shared sewer and water systems
 
04:51:13.670 --> 04:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
shared police and fire departments and
 
04:51:15.990 --> 04:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
regional planning committees which are
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
crucial for receiving federal funds
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
the minority many the minority amendment
 
04:51:24.948 --> 04:51:24.958 align:start position:0%
the minority map proposed only does a
 
04:51:27.190 --> 04:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
better job of preserving public health
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
regions to address their claim of moving
 
04:51:34.070 --> 04:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
people into a new seat mr speaker when
 
04:51:35.990 --> 04:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
we draw maps
 
04:51:38.150 --> 04:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as looking at the
 
04:51:41.430 --> 04:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
current map you draw new districts every
 
04:51:43.510 --> 04:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
time and if one was to look at the
 
04:51:46.550 --> 04:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
original versions of cd1 and cd2 as the
 
04:51:49.030 --> 04:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
minority said which was driven in 1880
 
04:51:51.670 --> 04:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't recognize them today and in
 
04:51:53.910 --> 04:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
fact there's been reports mr speaker
 
04:51:56.390 --> 04:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
public reports that the original maps
 
04:51:58.310 --> 04:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
were gerrymandered to dilute the
 
04:52:00.628 --> 04:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
catholic vote which is why nashua and
 
04:52:03.030 --> 04:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
manchester were originally separated i'm
 
04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
not making that accusation today mr
 
04:52:08.390 --> 04:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
speaker it was over 130 40 years ago but
 
04:52:09.830 --> 04:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
people should be aware of that while
 
04:52:11.430 --> 04:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
claims are being made
 
04:52:13.670 --> 04:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
with that mr speaker i ask that you vote
 
04:52:15.510 --> 04:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
no on this amendment and i request a
 
04:52:17.750 --> 04:52:17.760 align:start position:0%

04:52:25.110 --> 04:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:27.190 --> 04:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
04:52:28.788 --> 04:52:28.798 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote
 
04:52:38.480 --> 04:52:38.490 align:start position:0%

balanced congressional maps and if i

know that
 
04:54:12.470 --> 04:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
a rewrite of the map is entirely
 
04:54:14.310 --> 04:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
unnecessary as simple changes from this
 
04:54:15.990 --> 04:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
amendment will keep these districts
 
04:54:17.990 --> 04:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
competitive and if i know that this

independents alike to pick their

04:58:20.628 --> 04:58:20.638 align:start position:0%
the idea that i've been trying to bring
 
04:58:23.190 --> 04:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
to the special redistricting committee
 
04:58:24.708 --> 04:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
i've not been able to make the meetings
 
04:58:26.550 --> 04:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
but it's simply the idea that the
 
04:58:28.868 --> 04:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
boundary line should be as short as
 
04:58:28.878 --> 04:58:30.550 align:start position:0%
boundary line should be as short as
possible

04:58:30.550 --> 04:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:58:31.830 --> 04:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
and there are three reasons why you want
 
04:58:33.510 --> 04:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
a boundary line as short as possible
 
04:58:35.510 --> 04:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
what the map does in this case you just
 
04:58:38.708 --> 04:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
have rockingham county stratford county
 
04:58:40.230 --> 04:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
the city of nashua the city of
 
04:58:42.390 --> 04:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
manchester where we are would be one
 
04:58:44.708 --> 04:58:44.718 align:start position:0%
district joined by pelham litchfield and
 
04:58:46.788 --> 04:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
hudson so that would be the lower
 
04:58:49.910 --> 04:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
right-hand corner of the state
 
04:58:51.670 --> 04:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
that proposed
 
04:58:53.750 --> 04:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
district would give you the more compact
 
04:58:55.670 --> 04:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
district and then the northern and
 
04:58:57.990 --> 04:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
western parts of this the state would be
 
04:58:59.430 --> 04:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
the other district
 
04:59:01.430 --> 04:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
would be district 2.
 
04:59:03.670 --> 04:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
the reason for doing that is
 
04:59:05.750 --> 04:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
is going with the shortest boundary
 
04:59:07.830 --> 04:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
possible number one
 
04:59:11.110 --> 04:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
of all of the drawn up congressional
 
04:59:13.350 --> 04:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
maps the ones that have been thrown out
 
04:59:14.628 --> 04:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
by the courts
 
04:59:16.150 --> 04:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
whether it was in
 
04:59:18.390 --> 04:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
wisconsin ohio
 
04:59:19.910 --> 04:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
north carolina
 
04:59:22.550 --> 04:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania they've been long boundary
 
04:59:22.560 --> 04:59:23.670 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania they've been long boundary
districts

04:59:23.670 --> 04:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
districts
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
courts have thrown out long boundary
 
04:59:25.200 --> 04:59:26.788 align:start position:0%
courts have thrown out long boundary
districts

04:59:26.788 --> 04:59:26.798 align:start position:0%
districts
 
04:59:29.110 --> 04:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
time and again they very rarely survive
 
04:59:30.868 --> 04:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
the second reason is
 
04:59:32.708 --> 04:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
that the general public looks at long
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
boundary districts like the one proposed
 
04:59:37.590 --> 04:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
in 2271 h
 
04:59:39.670 --> 04:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
that has just been passed the majority
 
04:59:39.680 --> 04:59:40.868 align:start position:0%
that has just been passed the majority
recommendation

04:59:40.868 --> 04:59:40.878 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
04:59:40.878 --> 04:59:42.390 align:start position:0%
recommendation
and

04:59:42.390 --> 04:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:59:44.708 --> 04:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
they look at that and they feel like
 
04:59:46.868 --> 04:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
it looks like gerrymandering
 
04:59:48.628 --> 04:59:48.638 align:start position:0%
uh it looks unfair it looks like
 
04:59:50.070 --> 04:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
somebody was playing games it looks like
 
04:59:51.670 --> 04:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
somebody was drawing a line of spaghetti
 
04:59:52.948 --> 04:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
04:59:54.788 --> 04:59:54.798 align:start position:0%
now from from the inner district it
 
04:59:56.070 --> 04:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like that but from the
 
04:59:58.230 --> 04:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
outer district one member of this house
 
05:00:00.230 --> 05:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
said that it looks like someone would
 
05:00:03.110 --> 05:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
have to drive from nashua all the way to
 
05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
the north country and then come down to
 
05:00:07.510 --> 05:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
portsmouth and from the outside of the
 
05:00:10.150 --> 05:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
state it looks like
 
05:00:11.670 --> 05:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
it looks inappropriate it looks like
 
05:00:12.868 --> 05:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
it's unfair
 
05:00:14.788 --> 05:00:14.798 align:start position:0%
now i do agree
 
05:00:17.190 --> 05:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
with the intent
 
05:00:18.868 --> 05:00:18.878 align:start position:0%
of having a republican leaning district
 
05:00:21.270 --> 05:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
and the democrat leaning district
 
05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
having what what i called several years
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
ago proportional representation uh which
 
05:00:27.510 --> 05:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
i suggested before i ever became a
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
member of the
 
05:00:30.310 --> 05:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh this body
 
05:00:32.550 --> 05:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
so i i do think that it you you are no
 
05:00:33.670 --> 05:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
matter what kind of map you're going to
 
05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
draw you're going to end up in a 50-50
 
05:00:37.030 --> 05:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
state you're going to end up with one
 
05:00:38.470 --> 05:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
congressional district that leans a
 
05:00:39.910 --> 05:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
little republican and you're going to
 
05:00:41.110 --> 05:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
have one that leans a little bit
 
05:00:41.120 --> 05:00:42.150 align:start position:0%
have one that leans a little bit
democrat

05:00:42.150 --> 05:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
democrat
 
05:00:45.190 --> 05:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
however if we are are interested in
 
05:00:46.788 --> 05:00:46.798 align:start position:0%
maintaining accountability of our
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
elected officials then we need to have
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
competitive districts
 
05:00:53.830 --> 05:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
using dave's redistricting software
 
05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
online which is a
 
05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
powerful online software development
 
05:00:59.110 --> 05:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
tool we can actually measure the
 
05:01:00.550 --> 05:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
effectiveness and the quality of
 
05:01:02.470 --> 05:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
proposed districts and this district
 
05:01:02.480 --> 05:01:03.430 align:start position:0%
proposed districts and this district
design

05:01:03.430 --> 05:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
design
 
05:01:05.270 --> 05:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
achieves a score of 83 on
 
05:01:07.590 --> 05:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
competitiveness which is uh one of the
 
05:01:07.600 --> 05:01:09.190 align:start position:0%
competitiveness which is uh one of the
highest

05:01:09.190 --> 05:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
highest
 
05:01:10.230 --> 05:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
not only one of the highest in the
 
05:01:11.750 --> 05:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
country but it would be
 
05:01:13.590 --> 05:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
better than any of the other proposals
 
05:01:15.910 --> 05:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
that have been placed in front of us
 
05:01:17.430 --> 05:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
there's there are other reasons to
 
05:01:17.440 --> 05:01:18.868 align:start position:0%
there's there are other reasons to
support

05:01:18.868 --> 05:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:01:18.878 --> 05:01:19.750 align:start position:0%
support
uh

05:01:19.750 --> 05:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:01:23.270 --> 05:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
2301 over the other plans
 
05:01:25.910 --> 05:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the benefit of course is with the
 
05:01:28.150 --> 05:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
shortest boundary line you get lower
 
05:01:30.708 --> 05:01:30.718 align:start position:0%
cost campaigns so when when you have
 
05:01:32.230 --> 05:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
people campaigning for congress they
 
05:01:33.590 --> 05:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to raise as much money from
 
05:01:35.190 --> 05:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
special interest groups
 
05:01:36.788 --> 05:01:36.798 align:start position:0%
most of the special interest money
 
05:01:38.230 --> 05:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
pouring into new hampshire is pouring in
 
05:01:40.788 --> 05:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
from out of state of course
 
05:01:43.670 --> 05:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
and we want to have two representatives
 
05:01:46.470 --> 05:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
in our delegation who are answerable
 
05:01:48.948 --> 05:01:48.958 align:start position:0%
to us who are answerable to the voters
 
05:01:50.390 --> 05:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
and you're not going to get that
 
05:01:52.708 --> 05:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
answerability if they're having to raise
 
05:01:54.550 --> 05:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
twice as much money
 
05:01:57.350 --> 05:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
to campaign over a much larger area and
 
05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
possibly having to run tv ads
 
05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
in the expense of maine and
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
massachusetts markets which are which
 
05:02:04.708 --> 05:02:04.718 align:start position:0%
are really expensive and that would be a
 
05:02:06.310 --> 05:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
consequence of
 
05:02:08.628 --> 05:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
uh the majority's proposed plan i don't
 
05:02:09.990 --> 05:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
think that that was intended but that
 
05:02:11.670 --> 05:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
would be one of the unintended side
 
05:02:11.680 --> 05:02:14.230 align:start position:0%
would be one of the unintended side
effects

05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
i think that the
 
05:02:17.030 --> 05:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
going with shortest
 
05:02:19.110 --> 05:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
shortest boundary possible
 
05:02:21.990 --> 05:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
gives you some things more competitive
 
05:02:23.830 --> 05:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
putting the boundary
 
05:02:26.390 --> 05:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
as close to manchester as possible where
 
05:02:27.750 --> 05:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
we have the va and we have a lot of
 
05:02:29.910 --> 05:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
federal issues coming through manchester
 
05:02:31.990 --> 05:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
and nashua
 
05:02:33.830 --> 05:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
would give the voters who were along
 
05:02:35.190 --> 05:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
that boundary line who are along this
 
05:02:38.550 --> 05:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
corridor the 93 corridor would give them
 
05:02:38.560 --> 05:02:40.150 align:start position:0%
corridor the 93 corridor would give them
uh

05:02:40.150 --> 05:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:02:41.430 --> 05:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
greater ability to maintain
 
05:02:43.030 --> 05:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
accountability and it would be much
 
05:02:44.628 --> 05:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
easier to vote out
 
05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
members of congress who are not not
 
05:02:49.030 --> 05:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
being responsive to the voters
 
05:02:51.510 --> 05:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
so you would
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
according to software you would still
 
05:02:55.590 --> 05:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
get a basically an r plus three district
 
05:02:57.990 --> 05:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
and probably a d plus three district but
 
05:02:59.910 --> 05:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's inevitable with any plan
 
05:03:01.510 --> 05:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
that you have but i think it's having a
 
05:03:03.750 --> 05:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
more competitive district
 
05:03:06.230 --> 05:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
looks fairer it looks better it gives
 
05:03:08.390 --> 05:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
the voters of this state more control
 
05:03:10.470 --> 05:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
over who we have in congress
 
05:03:13.670 --> 05:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
we've looked at the results of
 
05:03:15.590 --> 05:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
other states that for various reasons
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
are stuck with either you know one
 
05:03:19.910 --> 05:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
republican or one democrat or a group of
 
05:03:22.470 --> 05:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
entrenched republicans and democrats and
 
05:03:23.990 --> 05:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
the the results are not good their
 
05:03:25.830 --> 05:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
members of congress are much much less
 
05:03:27.910 --> 05:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
responsive to the concerns of the voters
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
and many of them don't even have uh town
 
05:03:30.788 --> 05:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
hall meetings and don't even come back
 
05:03:32.470 --> 05:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
to their district and some of them don't
 
05:03:34.230 --> 05:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
even live in their district so i'm
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
asking members to
 
05:03:39.030 --> 05:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
press the green button and support
 
05:03:41.190 --> 05:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
amendment 2301 it would just carve out a
 
05:03:43.350 --> 05:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
much smaller district or a much more
 
05:03:44.868 --> 05:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
compact district in the lower right hand
 
05:03:46.470 --> 05:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
corner of the state and the rest of the
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:52.708 --> 05:03:52.718 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative barry
 
05:03:55.350 --> 05:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh yes mr speaker thank you um the
 
05:03:58.070 --> 05:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
proposed maps creates a he talks about
 
05:03:59.590 --> 05:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
the size of the districts the proposed
 
05:04:02.310 --> 05:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
maps creates a cd2 that's significantly
 
05:04:03.910 --> 05:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
larger and thus more expensive to
 
05:04:05.190 --> 05:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
campaign in
 
05:04:06.948 --> 05:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
but to address specifically he makes an
 
05:04:08.230 --> 05:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
argument about the length of the
 
05:04:12.070 --> 05:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
district mr chairman the aclu brought
 
05:04:14.070 --> 05:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
forward a i believe it's a 42-page
 
05:04:16.310 --> 05:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
document review reviewing the proposed
 
05:04:19.628 --> 05:04:19.638 align:start position:0%
majorities maps and at no point did the
 
05:04:23.350 --> 05:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
aclu raise a legal argument
 
05:04:25.350 --> 05:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
against the majorities maps the
 
05:04:27.350 --> 05:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
majorities maps has a population
 
05:04:30.948 --> 05:04:30.958 align:start position:0%
deviation of 88 people and 89 people
 
05:04:34.708 --> 05:04:34.718 align:start position:0%
respectively and it never divides a town
 
05:04:36.788 --> 05:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
so we managed to get that low of a
 
05:04:40.788 --> 05:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
deviation in a state of 1.377
 
05:04:44.310 --> 05:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
million people we got it down to 88 and
 
05:04:47.350 --> 05:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
89 respectfully and with that mr speaker
 
05:04:48.628 --> 05:04:48.638 align:start position:0%
i ask that
 
05:04:50.868 --> 05:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
fellow members vote no and i request a
 
05:04:55.590 --> 05:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:57.670 --> 05:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
a roll call has been requested is that
 
05:05:03.590 --> 05:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:05.510 --> 05:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
05:05:07.590 --> 05:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote members take their
 
05:05:07.600 --> 05:05:08.948 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote members take their
seats

05:05:08.948 --> 05:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
seats
 
05:05:20.310 --> 05:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:20.320 --> 05:05:54.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:05:54.470 --> 05:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:26.708 --> 05:06:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:29.190 --> 05:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the abramson
 
05:06:31.750 --> 05:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
floor amendment
 
05:06:34.230 --> 05:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote
 
05:06:36.868 --> 05:06:36.878 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
05:06:41.590 --> 05:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:43.270 --> 05:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
05:06:45.270 --> 05:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
mr speaker if i agree
 
05:06:47.510 --> 05:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
with my friend from seabrook that
 
05:06:49.590 --> 05:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
competitive districts are a mechanism
 
05:06:52.708 --> 05:06:52.718 align:start position:0%
that voters have to enforce term limits
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
if i know that keeping the seacoast
 
05:06:57.430 --> 05:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
nashua manchester stratford and
 
05:06:59.830 --> 05:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
rockingham county together provides the
 
05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
community of interest representation
 
05:07:04.390 --> 05:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
better than even the current map so that
 
05:07:06.230 --> 05:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
congressman and congresswoman can better
 
05:07:07.830 --> 05:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
serve their constituents
 
05:07:10.150 --> 05:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
and if i am happy to vote for a map that
 
05:07:12.310 --> 05:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't put portsmouth and nashua in the
 
05:07:14.948 --> 05:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
same cd but makes you have to drive to
 
05:07:16.948 --> 05:07:16.958 align:start position:0%
mount washington to get from one to the
 
05:07:16.958 --> 05:07:17.830 align:start position:0%
mount washington to get from one to the
other

05:07:17.830 --> 05:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
would i now cast this proudly bipartisan
 
05:07:26.788 --> 05:07:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:29.990 --> 05:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes
 
05:07:32.150 --> 05:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative lin for a parliamentary
 
05:07:32.160 --> 05:07:35.270 align:start position:0%
representative lin for a parliamentary
inquiry

05:07:35.270 --> 05:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:38.150 --> 05:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you mr speaker
 
05:07:41.350 --> 05:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
if i know that the comp that the current
 
05:07:43.910 --> 05:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
districts are not competitive
 
05:07:46.390 --> 05:07:46.400 align:start position:0%

make them competitive and if i know as
 
05:07:56.948 --> 05:07:56.958 align:start position:0%
previously pointed out that there is no
 
05:07:58.948 --> 05:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue
 
05:08:02.310 --> 05:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
with the majorities proposed

uh virtually not in reality
 
05:11:34.150 --> 05:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:37.990 --> 05:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
and i thank you mr speaker for ensuring
 
05:11:38.000 --> 05:11:38.948 align:start position:0%
and i thank you mr speaker for ensuring
that

05:11:38.948 --> 05:11:38.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:11:41.190 --> 05:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
the members of the
 
05:11:44.868 --> 05:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
new hampshire house are listening
 
05:11:47.670 --> 05:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
we are an interesting state
 
05:11:50.390 --> 05:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
it is one of the reasons that we have
 
05:11:53.750 --> 05:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
been able to maintain the position of a
 
05:11:56.868 --> 05:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
first in the nation primary
 
05:11:58.948 --> 05:11:58.958 align:start position:0%
we are about
 
05:12:01.670 --> 05:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
one-third republican
 
05:12:05.310 --> 05:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
one-third democratic and one-third
 
05:12:05.320 --> 05:12:07.110 align:start position:0%
one-third democratic and one-third
undeclared

05:12:07.110 --> 05:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
undeclared
 
05:12:09.590 --> 05:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
we know that the undeclared really
 
05:12:12.550 --> 05:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean neutral many members of the
 
05:12:14.470 --> 05:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
undeclared are
 
05:12:17.510 --> 05:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
favoring one party or the other but that
 
05:12:17.520 --> 05:12:18.788 align:start position:0%
favoring one party or the other but that
mix

05:12:18.788 --> 05:12:18.798 align:start position:0%
mix
 
05:12:22.230 --> 05:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
and the possibility of an open primary
 
05:12:23.590 --> 05:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
makes us
 
05:12:23.600 --> 05:12:24.708 align:start position:0%
makes us
very

05:12:24.708 --> 05:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:12:24.718 --> 05:12:26.470 align:start position:0%
very
appealing

05:12:26.470 --> 05:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
appealing
 
05:12:26.480 --> 05:12:27.270 align:start position:0%
appealing
when

05:12:27.270 --> 05:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:12:30.310 --> 05:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
presidentials want to come and
 
05:12:32.550 --> 05:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
tell us how wonderful they would be if
 
05:12:36.150 --> 05:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
they could serve in that position
 
05:12:38.310 --> 05:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that we have been
 
05:12:41.350 --> 05:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
able to maintain this position is that
 
05:12:46.150 --> 05:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
we are in fact a purple state
 
05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
parts of the state are more red parts
 
05:12:51.750 --> 05:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
are more blue but all together we are
 
05:12:51.760 --> 05:12:52.788 align:start position:0%
are more blue but all together we are
purple

05:12:52.788 --> 05:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
purple
 
05:12:54.708 --> 05:12:54.718 align:start position:0%
and we see that
 
05:12:58.868 --> 05:12:58.878 align:start position:0%
when we realize in the new hampshire
 
05:13:01.590 --> 05:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
representatives to the u.s congress how
 
05:13:03.350 --> 05:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
many times
 
05:13:07.030 --> 05:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
we have changed parties
 
05:13:10.550 --> 05:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
that is a tribute to all of us in this
 
05:13:10.560 --> 05:13:11.590 align:start position:0%
that is a tribute to all of us in this
state

05:13:11.590 --> 05:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:13:13.590 --> 05:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
that we take seriously our
 
05:13:13.600 --> 05:13:15.350 align:start position:0%
that we take seriously our
responsibility

05:13:15.350 --> 05:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
05:13:19.110 --> 05:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
in who we vote for and why we are voting
 
05:13:20.310 --> 05:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
for them
 
05:13:22.948 --> 05:13:22.958 align:start position:0%
and it means that we as elected
 
05:13:22.958 --> 05:13:24.470 align:start position:0%
and it means that we as elected
officials

05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
officials
 
05:13:27.350 --> 05:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
have to pay attention
 
05:13:30.788 --> 05:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
to what the citizens are telling us
 
05:13:33.750 --> 05:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
about how they want us to run
 
05:13:36.150 --> 05:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
their government
 
05:13:38.948 --> 05:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
that mr speaker is why
 
05:13:43.030 --> 05:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
i ask this body to oppose the pending
 
05:13:43.040 --> 05:13:44.230 align:start position:0%
i ask this body to oppose the pending
question

05:13:44.230 --> 05:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:13:46.390 --> 05:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
the pending question
 
05:13:48.868 --> 05:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
sets up districts in order to
 
05:13:48.878 --> 05:13:51.190 align:start position:0%
sets up districts in order to
predetermine

05:13:51.190 --> 05:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
predetermine
 
05:13:53.670 --> 05:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
the outcome of the election
 
05:13:56.628 --> 05:13:56.638 align:start position:0%
and therefore deny
 
05:13:58.868 --> 05:13:58.878 align:start position:0%
the voters of this state the opportunity
 
05:14:02.070 --> 05:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
to decide from themselves i believe
 
05:14:04.868 --> 05:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
that this body is better than that i
 
05:14:07.510 --> 05:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
believe that this body understands that
 
05:14:09.830 --> 05:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
we have to respect
 
05:14:12.150 --> 05:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
the voters in this state and their
 
05:14:15.430 --> 05:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
desire to be able to say at every two
 
05:14:18.550 --> 05:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
years whether they want a republican a
 
05:14:21.830 --> 05:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
democrat or someone else to represent
 
05:14:21.840 --> 05:14:22.788 align:start position:0%
democrat or someone else to represent
them

05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:14:25.990 --> 05:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore mr speaker with great
 
05:14:26.000 --> 05:14:27.350 align:start position:0%
and therefore mr speaker with great
sadness

05:14:27.350 --> 05:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
sadness
 
05:14:29.910 --> 05:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
but with a great degree of commitment i
 
05:14:33.110 --> 05:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
ask this body to reject
 
05:14:36.550 --> 05:14:36.560 align:start position:0%

05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%

the opportunity
 
05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%

amendment

05:15:23.350 --> 05:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:15:25.590 --> 05:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
which is now before
 
05:15:27.430 --> 05:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
before us
 
05:15:29.590 --> 05:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
we had to change the district because
 
05:15:31.670 --> 05:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
the population in the state changed and
 
05:15:33.750 --> 05:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
the po and ex and the changing
 
05:15:35.990 --> 05:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
population was not equal between the
 
05:15:36.000 --> 05:15:37.110 align:start position:0%
population was not equal between the
districts

05:15:37.110 --> 05:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
districts
 
05:15:37.120 --> 05:15:38.628 align:start position:0%
districts
cd1

05:15:38.628 --> 05:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
cd1
 
05:15:42.230 --> 05:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
gained more population than did cd2
 
05:15:45.750 --> 05:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
our plan meets constitutional one-man
 
05:15:48.230 --> 05:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
one-vote requirements as was previously
 
05:15:50.310 --> 05:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned the population difference
 
05:15:53.910 --> 05:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
between cd1 and cd2 under our proposal
 
05:15:57.030 --> 05:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
is at most 89 individuals out of a total
 
05:15:58.868 --> 05:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
state population
 
05:16:00.550 --> 05:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
of almost
 
05:16:00.560 --> 05:16:02.070 align:start position:0%
of almost
1.4

05:16:02.070 --> 05:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
1.4
 
05:16:03.830 --> 05:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
million people
 
05:16:06.550 --> 05:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
our plan also maintains
 
05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
contiguity among all towns and cities in
 
05:16:11.110 --> 05:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
each district
 
05:16:15.350 --> 05:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
and does not divide any town or city
 
05:16:18.310 --> 05:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
we've heard much during the committee's
 
05:16:22.628 --> 05:16:22.638 align:start position:0%
proceedings about gerrymandering
 
05:16:22.638 --> 05:16:23.510 align:start position:0%
proceedings about gerrymandering
the

05:16:23.510 --> 05:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:16:26.390 --> 05:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
dictionary merriam-webster definition of
 
05:16:26.400 --> 05:16:27.830 align:start position:0%
dictionary merriam-webster definition of
gerrymander

05:16:27.830 --> 05:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
gerrymander
 
05:16:29.910 --> 05:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
is and i quote
 
05:16:33.590 --> 05:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
to divide or arrange a territorial unit
 
05:16:36.230 --> 05:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
into election districts in a way
 
05:16:39.990 --> 05:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
to give one political party an unfair
 
05:16:40.000 --> 05:16:41.430 align:start position:0%
to give one political party an unfair
advantage

05:16:41.430 --> 05:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
05:16:44.470 --> 05:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
unfair advantage
 
05:16:46.310 --> 05:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
so let's see if
 
05:16:49.590 --> 05:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
if that's what actually happened here
 
05:16:52.070 --> 05:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
in fact the map created by the majority
 
05:16:53.910 --> 05:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
does not create
 
05:16:56.948 --> 05:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
unfair advantages in fact it removes
 
05:16:56.958 --> 05:16:58.550 align:start position:0%
unfair advantages in fact it removes
them

05:16:58.550 --> 05:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:17:00.470 --> 05:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
we've heard throughout the proceedings
 
05:17:02.230 --> 05:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you've heard on more than
 
05:17:02.240 --> 05:17:03.110 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you've heard on more than
one

05:17:03.110 --> 05:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:17:03.120 --> 05:17:04.310 align:start position:0%
one
occasion

05:17:04.310 --> 05:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
occasion
 
05:17:06.070 --> 05:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
in the newspapers or you've read in the
 
05:17:08.550 --> 05:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
newspapers you've heard on tv
 
05:17:11.430 --> 05:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
the phrase quote voters should choose
 
05:17:13.110 --> 05:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
their reps
 
05:17:16.230 --> 05:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
not the other way around unquote
 
05:17:18.948 --> 05:17:18.958 align:start position:0%
i have to admit that's a great talking
 
05:17:18.958 --> 05:17:20.230 align:start position:0%
i have to admit that's a great talking
point

05:17:20.230 --> 05:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:17:22.550 --> 05:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
the only problem is if you actually look
 
05:17:23.430 --> 05:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
at it
 
05:17:25.670 --> 05:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
and and scrutinize it for a moment
 
05:17:28.390 --> 05:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
there's no substance to it
 
05:17:31.510 --> 05:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
whether directly or indirectly through
 
05:17:33.910 --> 05:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
some kind of quote-unquote independent
 
05:17:33.920 --> 05:17:35.030 align:start position:0%
some kind of quote-unquote independent
commission

05:17:35.030 --> 05:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:17:37.190 --> 05:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
created by legislators
 
05:17:41.110 --> 05:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
it is always legislators who decide what
 
05:17:43.830 --> 05:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
districts voters are assigned to
 
05:17:48.868 --> 05:17:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:50.948 --> 05:17:50.958 align:start position:0%
many we heard from during our proceed
 
05:17:53.350 --> 05:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
during the committee's proceedings
 
05:17:55.510 --> 05:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
asked us to account for
 
05:17:58.310 --> 05:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
communities of interest
 
05:18:00.470 --> 05:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
interestingly however
 
05:18:03.430 --> 05:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
the only community of interest
 
05:18:05.430 --> 05:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
that they never mentioned that they
 
05:18:07.270 --> 05:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
wanted us to consider
 
05:18:10.628 --> 05:18:10.638 align:start position:0%
was political like-mindedness
 
05:18:12.948 --> 05:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
yet particularly considering that what
 
05:18:15.910 --> 05:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
we are dividing up our districts for
 
05:18:17.750 --> 05:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
voting purposes
 
05:18:20.310 --> 05:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
political affinity would seem to be
 
05:18:23.590 --> 05:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
among the most important considerations
 
05:18:25.590 --> 05:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
in this regard i note
 
05:18:28.628 --> 05:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
that in 2012
 
05:18:31.350 --> 05:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
our democratic friends recognized that
 
05:18:33.830 --> 05:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
political similarities did constitute a
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
community of interest
 
05:18:38.550 --> 05:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
they then told the supreme court
 
05:18:42.550 --> 05:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
to define community of interest as quote
 
05:18:45.110 --> 05:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
a group of people concentrated in a
 
05:18:47.750 --> 05:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
geographic area who share similar
 
05:18:49.750 --> 05:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
interests and priorities
 
05:18:51.190 --> 05:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
whether social
 
05:18:51.200 --> 05:18:52.390 align:start position:0%

05:19:09.350 --> 05:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
republicans and democrats

for example

not only politically
 
05:19:20.868 --> 05:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
but socially and culturally
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
the portsmouth durham area
 
05:19:25.830 --> 05:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
has much more in common
 
05:19:27.430 --> 05:19:27.440 align:start position:0%

much better
 
05:19:45.110 --> 05:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
than does the democratic proposal

also under our plan

05:19:55.670 --> 05:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
as the many smaller communities
 
05:19:58.230 --> 05:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
that make up a significant portion
 
05:20:01.270 --> 05:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
of its commuter workforce
 
05:20:03.030 --> 05:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that has frequently
 
05:20:04.948 --> 05:20:04.958 align:start position:0%
been raised and asked both throughout
 
05:20:07.190 --> 05:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
our proceedings and here is
 
05:20:10.150 --> 05:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
are the current districts competitive
 
05:20:12.230 --> 05:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
contrary to claims
 
05:20:13.670 --> 05:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
to claims
 
05:20:18.550 --> 05:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
the reality is that neither cd1 nor cd2
 
05:20:21.030 --> 05:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
but particularly the latter
 
05:20:23.830 --> 05:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
is competitive
 
05:20:26.070 --> 05:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
says that the democratic advantage in
 
05:20:26.080 --> 05:20:27.590 align:start position:0%
says that the democratic advantage in
cd1

05:20:27.590 --> 05:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
cd1
 
05:20:30.470 --> 05:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
is plus 5.2
 
05:20:32.070 --> 05:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
and that the democratic
 
05:20:34.150 --> 05:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
advantage in cd2
 
05:20:36.868 --> 05:20:36.878 align:start position:0%
is plus 10.4
 
05:20:40.070 --> 05:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
no one can seriously believe
 
05:20:43.030 --> 05:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
that a district with a 10.4
 
05:20:54.470 --> 05:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:56.548 --> 05:20:56.558 align:start position:0%
according to mapathon
 
05:21:00.310 --> 05:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
our proposal actually makes cd1 more
 
05:21:00.320 --> 05:21:01.510 align:start position:0%
our proposal actually makes cd1 more
competitive

05:21:01.510 --> 05:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
05:21:04.230 --> 05:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
by changing the district from 5.2
 
05:21:05.670 --> 05:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
percent plus
 
05:21:08.150 --> 05:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
for our democratic colleagues to one
 
05:21:11.670 --> 05:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
point eight percent for republicans
 
05:21:13.510 --> 05:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
let's talk more fundamentally though
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
about how important is competitiveness
 
05:21:19.350 --> 05:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
comp the arguments that we heard during
 
05:21:20.830 --> 05:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
our proceedings were that
 
05:21:23.270 --> 05:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
competitiveness forces can competitive
 
05:21:25.190 --> 05:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
districts forces candidates to the
 
05:21:25.200 --> 05:21:26.470 align:start position:0%
districts forces candidates to the
center

05:21:26.470 --> 05:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
center
 
05:21:29.990 --> 05:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
well ask yourself is this really true
 
05:21:32.230 --> 05:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
given that to win the nomination of
 
05:21:33.750 --> 05:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
either party
 
05:21:36.948 --> 05:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
candidates have to appeal to their base
 
05:21:40.070 --> 05:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
which is usually not in the center
 
05:21:41.430 --> 05:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
for example
 
05:21:43.670 --> 05:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
claims that bernie sanders can't win a
 
05:21:46.628 --> 05:21:46.638 align:start position:0%
national election did not prevent
 
05:21:48.548 --> 05:21:48.558 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire democratic colleagues
 
05:21:50.470 --> 05:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
from giving him a victory in our
 
05:21:52.548 --> 05:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
presidential primary
 
05:21:54.948 --> 05:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
more importantly
 
05:21:57.190 --> 05:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
forcing to the center
 
05:22:01.190 --> 05:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
discourages reforms and new ideas
 
05:22:02.548 --> 05:22:02.558 align:start position:0%
in a sense
 
05:22:05.350 --> 05:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
it is analogous to cancel culture
 
05:22:08.310 --> 05:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
in that it says that debate is permitted
 
05:22:10.470 --> 05:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
only within a narrow range of
 
05:22:10.480 --> 05:22:11.990 align:start position:0%
only within a narrow range of
acceptability

05:22:11.990 --> 05:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
acceptability
 
05:22:14.948 --> 05:22:14.958 align:start position:0%
as determined by some nebulous standard
 
05:22:17.830 --> 05:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
established by the media or other elite
 
05:22:20.628 --> 05:22:20.638 align:start position:0%
forces not accountable to the citizenry
 
05:22:22.628 --> 05:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
as examples
 
05:22:25.830 --> 05:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
would ronald reagan or bernie sanders
 
05:22:28.548 --> 05:22:28.558 align:start position:0%
ever have emerged as real political
 
05:22:28.558 --> 05:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
ever have emerged as real political
forces

05:22:29.590 --> 05:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
forces
 
05:22:32.708 --> 05:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
under the quote centrist candidates only
 
05:22:32.718 --> 05:22:34.788 align:start position:0%
under the quote centrist candidates only
formulation

05:22:34.788 --> 05:22:34.798 align:start position:0%
formulation
 
05:22:36.390 --> 05:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many of you in this
 
05:22:39.350 --> 05:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
room are old enough to remember as i do
 
05:22:41.270 --> 05:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
when ronald reagan first became
 
05:22:43.590 --> 05:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
politically prominent
 
05:22:46.708 --> 05:22:46.718 align:start position:0%
and one and one national office but i
 
05:22:48.868 --> 05:22:48.878 align:start position:0%
remember clearly
 
05:22:53.270 --> 05:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
the attacks on him by uh by on mr reagan
 
05:22:55.190 --> 05:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
president reagan by both democrats and
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
more centrist republicans
 
05:23:01.030 --> 05:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
his views on foreign policy will quote
 
05:23:02.948 --> 05:23:02.958 align:start position:0%
start world war three
 
05:23:06.070 --> 05:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
and his domestic policies are voodoo
 
05:23:06.080 --> 05:23:07.830 align:start position:0%
and his domestic policies are voodoo
economics

05:23:07.830 --> 05:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
economics
 
05:23:09.910 --> 05:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
yet those policies brought about the
 
05:23:12.788 --> 05:23:12.798 align:start position:0%
collapse of the soviet union and one of
 
05:23:15.190 --> 05:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
our longest periods of sustained
 
05:23:15.200 --> 05:23:16.948 align:start position:0%
our longest periods of sustained
prosperity

05:23:16.948 --> 05:23:16.958 align:start position:0%
prosperity
 
05:23:19.750 --> 05:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
so what is the bottom line
 
05:23:22.548 --> 05:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
our colleagues across the aisle
 
05:23:24.628 --> 05:23:24.638 align:start position:0%
basically assert that on us on a
 
05:23:26.548 --> 05:23:26.558 align:start position:0%
statewide basis
 
05:23:28.708 --> 05:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
our congressional delegation
 
05:23:30.390 --> 05:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
should produce an allocation that
 
05:23:32.470 --> 05:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
matches the political breakdown of the
 
05:23:32.480 --> 05:23:33.830 align:start position:0%
matches the political breakdown of the
state

05:23:33.830 --> 05:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:23:35.990 --> 05:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
they argue in effect
 
05:23:37.910 --> 05:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire voters
 
05:23:37.920 --> 05:23:38.948 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire voters
generally

05:23:38.948 --> 05:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
generally
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
lean about 52 percent voting democrat
 
05:23:46.070 --> 05:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
and 45 percent voting republican
 
05:23:47.670 --> 05:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i agree with that
 
05:23:47.680 --> 05:23:48.868 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i agree with that
assessment

05:23:48.868 --> 05:23:48.878 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
05:23:51.830 --> 05:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
nor do i agree with their idea
 
05:23:53.830 --> 05:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
that a voter whose vote is equally
 
05:23:56.948 --> 05:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
weighted with that of every other voter
 
05:23:59.430 --> 05:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
under the one-man one-vote principle
 
05:24:02.390 --> 05:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
is somehow disenfranchised because of
 
05:24:04.390 --> 05:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
the way other voters in his or her
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
district are likely to vote
 
05:24:09.270 --> 05:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
but for present purposes
 
05:24:10.948 --> 05:24:10.958 align:start position:0%
let's assume that our democratic
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues view is correct
 
05:24:15.830 --> 05:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
what our friends across the aisle
 
05:24:17.830 --> 05:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
propose to do
 
05:24:20.548 --> 05:24:20.558 align:start position:0%
is construct our congressional districts
 
05:24:23.110 --> 05:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
so that both districts will be democrat
 
05:24:26.230 --> 05:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
leaning anywhere from roughly 4.5
 
05:24:29.030 --> 05:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
percent to 10
 
05:24:30.868 --> 05:24:30.878 align:start position:0%
and what will the result of their
 
05:24:33.030 --> 05:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
formulation and what will be the result
 
05:24:35.830 --> 05:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
of their formulation
 
05:24:38.708 --> 05:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
52 percent of the voters
 
05:24:41.990 --> 05:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
democrats will get 100 percent of the
 
05:24:43.670 --> 05:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
congressional seats
 
05:24:46.230 --> 05:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
they will win both cd1
 
05:24:47.910 --> 05:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
and cd2
 
05:24:50.548 --> 05:24:50.558 align:start position:0%
meaning that under their thesis
 
05:24:53.110 --> 05:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
the 45 percent of the electorate that
 
05:24:55.350 --> 05:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
tends to vote republican
 
05:24:57.750 --> 05:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
will be disenfranchised
 
05:24:59.590 --> 05:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
under the republican proposal by
 
05:24:59.600 --> 05:25:00.708 align:start position:0%
under the republican proposal by
contrast

05:25:00.708 --> 05:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
contrast
 
05:25:02.948 --> 05:25:02.958 align:start position:0%
which aligns the districts more closely
 
05:25:04.948 --> 05:25:04.958 align:start position:0%
to the voters leanings
 
05:25:09.110 --> 05:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
the 52 percent democrat versus 45
 
05:25:10.868 --> 05:25:10.878 align:start position:0%
republican breakdown
 
05:25:13.830 --> 05:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
will more likely although by no means
 
05:25:13.840 --> 05:25:15.030 align:start position:0%
will more likely although by no means
inevitably

05:25:15.030 --> 05:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
inevitably
 
05:25:20.470 --> 05:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
yield a 50 50 split one democrat in cd2
 
05:25:23.750 --> 05:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
and one republican in cd1
 
05:25:26.390 --> 05:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
thus under our formulation
 
05:25:29.030 --> 05:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
only two percent of democratic voters
 
05:25:31.350 --> 05:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
will be disenfranchised
 
05:25:33.350 --> 05:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
so ask yourself
 
05:25:35.470 --> 05:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
which is fairer
 
05:25:37.830 --> 05:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising the 45 percent of
 
05:25:40.628 --> 05:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
voters who lean republican
 
05:25:43.350 --> 05:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
or the 2 percent of voters who lean
 
05:25:43.360 --> 05:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
or the 2 percent of voters who lean
democratic

05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
democratic
 
05:25:46.470 --> 05:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
the answer
 
05:25:50.470 --> 05:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:53.270 --> 05:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
for all of these reasons
 
05:25:56.150 --> 05:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
i ask you to support the majority
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
proposal the majority amendment and push
 
05:26:01.990 --> 05:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
the green button i would also move mr
 
05:26:04.230 --> 05:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
speaker that this debate be put in the
 
05:26:06.868 --> 05:26:06.878 align:start position:0%
per uh in the permanent journal thank
 
05:26:09.350 --> 05:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
you mr speaker yeah that that's that's a
 
05:26:11.270 --> 05:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
separate motion later
 
05:26:23.350 --> 05:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:24.470 --> 05:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
the ques
 
05:26:28.150 --> 05:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
the question now on is the octopass with
 
05:26:33.510 --> 05:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:35.110 --> 05:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
are you ready
 
05:26:37.990 --> 05:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
roll call i was waiting for that
 
05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative speedy who requests a
 
05:26:42.390 --> 05:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
roll call is that sufficiently seconded
 
05:26:44.230 --> 05:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this is
 
05:26:45.990 --> 05:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a roll call vote members
 
05:26:47.490 --> 05:26:47.500 align:start position:0%
take their seats
 
05:26:47.500 --> 05:27:09.430 align:start position:0%
take their seats

unchanged since they were first
 
05:27:57.670 --> 05:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
established in the 1880s and i believe
 
05:27:59.030 --> 05:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
that we have been doing it right the
 
05:28:01.590 --> 05:28:01.600 align:start position:0%

and is recognized to speak to emotion
 
05:37:31.670 --> 05:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and i am at
 
05:37:35.030 --> 05:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:37.830 --> 05:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
so there are 10 counties in the state as
 
05:37:39.510 --> 05:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
you all know
 
05:37:41.510 --> 05:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
one county
 
05:37:43.830 --> 05:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
elects its county commissioners as a
 
05:37:45.990 --> 05:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
whole county wide
 
05:37:48.070 --> 05:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
so that didn't change so now we're down
 
05:37:49.910 --> 05:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
to nine
 
05:37:51.910 --> 05:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
you will be glad to know that the
 
05:37:55.590 --> 05:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
committee members agreed
 
05:37:55.600 --> 05:37:56.628 align:start position:0%
committee members agreed
on

05:37:56.628 --> 05:37:56.638 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:38:01.670 --> 05:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
the maps for five of the other counties
 
05:38:04.788 --> 05:38:04.798 align:start position:0%
so we're down to four counties and the
 
05:38:07.830 --> 05:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
minority amendment addresses those four
 
05:38:07.840 --> 05:38:09.510 align:start position:0%
minority amendment addresses those four
counties

05:38:09.510 --> 05:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
counties
 
05:38:12.310 --> 05:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
they are counties in which the majority
 
05:38:15.270 --> 05:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
made significant
 
05:38:15.280 --> 05:38:16.788 align:start position:0%
made significant
changes

05:38:16.788 --> 05:38:16.798 align:start position:0%
changes
 
05:38:19.510 --> 05:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
but the minority majority report says
 
05:38:22.070 --> 05:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
only that the changes that they made
 
05:38:24.708 --> 05:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
were constitutional there doesn't seem
 
05:38:26.230 --> 05:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
to be any
 
05:38:30.548 --> 05:38:30.558 align:start position:0%
reason for those significant changes
 
05:38:32.948 --> 05:38:32.958 align:start position:0%
and the minority having looked at the
 
05:38:34.830 --> 05:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
maps that we have
 
05:38:38.470 --> 05:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
now have realized that
 
05:38:43.350 --> 05:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
with no changes or minimum changes
 
05:38:45.708 --> 05:38:45.718 align:start position:0%
we have achieved
 
05:38:49.030 --> 05:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
deviations that are far
 
05:38:53.270 --> 05:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
less significant than the majority
 
05:38:56.788 --> 05:38:56.798 align:start position:0%
so in carroll county
 
05:38:59.990 --> 05:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
the majority has a map which goes in
 
05:39:04.470 --> 05:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
deviation from minus 3.3 to plus 2.6 for
 
05:39:07.350 --> 05:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
a total of 5.9
 
05:39:09.830 --> 05:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
the minority with no change to the map
 
05:39:11.590 --> 05:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
at all
 
05:39:15.510 --> 05:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
has achieved a deviation of 2.9 roughly
 
05:39:15.520 --> 05:39:16.470 align:start position:0%
has achieved a deviation of 2.9 roughly
half

05:39:16.470 --> 05:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
half
 
05:39:19.270 --> 05:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
of the majority plan
 
05:39:22.628 --> 05:39:22.638 align:start position:0%
in merrimack county where significant
 
05:39:25.270 --> 05:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
hinges were made by the majority
 
05:39:28.390 --> 05:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
the minority moved only one town in
 
05:39:30.150 --> 05:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
order to balance
 
05:39:30.160 --> 05:39:31.030 align:start position:0%
order to balance
the

05:39:31.030 --> 05:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:39:33.270 --> 05:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
numbers and that's the only change that
 
05:39:37.590 --> 05:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:41.510 --> 05:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
in rockingham county
 
05:39:45.350 --> 05:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
the majority total deviation is 8.2
 
05:39:45.360 --> 05:39:47.110 align:start position:0%
the majority total deviation is 8.2
percent

05:39:47.110 --> 05:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:39:50.390 --> 05:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
if you continue the current map
 
05:39:53.430 --> 05:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
you get a total of deviation of 5.5
 
05:39:53.440 --> 05:39:55.430 align:start position:0%
you get a total of deviation of 5.5
percent

05:39:55.430 --> 05:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:39:58.628 --> 05:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
and finally in cheshire county
 
05:39:58.638 --> 05:39:59.750 align:start position:0%
and finally in cheshire county
where

05:39:59.750 --> 05:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:40:02.310 --> 05:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
the keene area district was kept the
 
05:40:02.320 --> 05:40:03.590 align:start position:0%
the keene area district was kept the
same

05:40:03.590 --> 05:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
same
 
05:40:05.990 --> 05:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
but where we now have one easterly
 
05:40:08.230 --> 05:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
oriented district and one westerly
 
05:40:10.070 --> 05:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
oriented district
 
05:40:12.230 --> 05:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
the district was rotated to be a
 
05:40:16.548 --> 05:40:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:20.230 --> 05:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
that was done at a deviation of 7.5
 
05:40:20.240 --> 05:40:21.830 align:start position:0%
that was done at a deviation of 7.5
percent

05:40:21.830 --> 05:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
percent
 
05:40:24.628 --> 05:40:24.638 align:start position:0%
where no change would have kept the
 
05:40:28.788 --> 05:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
deviation down to 3.7
 
05:40:32.070 --> 05:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
so if you are dedicated to the person to
 
05:40:33.750 --> 05:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
the proposition
 
05:40:36.070 --> 05:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
that every person's vote should count
 
05:40:39.430 --> 05:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
the same or as close as we can make it
 
05:40:41.350 --> 05:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing that it's never going to be
 
05:40:41.360 --> 05:40:42.628 align:start position:0%
recognizing that it's never going to be
perfect

05:40:42.628 --> 05:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
05:40:45.110 --> 05:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
i would urge you to adopt the minority
 
05:40:47.510 --> 05:40:47.520 align:start position:0%

the minority amendment
 
05:41:10.718 --> 05:41:11.510 align:start position:0%
the minority amendment
as

05:41:11.510 --> 05:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:41:14.628 --> 05:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
was stated keeps most of the districts
 
05:41:15.830 --> 05:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
the same
 
05:41:17.910 --> 05:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
the majority amendment which we have
 
05:41:19.590 --> 05:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
already adopted
 
05:41:21.990 --> 05:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
aligns the
 
05:41:24.390 --> 05:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
county commissioner districts better
 
05:41:27.270 --> 05:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
with the state rep districts that we
 
05:41:30.070 --> 05:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
previously adopted
 
05:41:32.070 --> 05:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:41:34.948 --> 05:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
only other significant change was in
 
05:41:36.628 --> 05:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
merrimack county
 
05:41:36.638 --> 05:41:37.510 align:start position:0%
merrimack county
where

05:41:37.510 --> 05:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:41:41.190 --> 05:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
the majority plan has one town
 
05:41:43.270 --> 05:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
with the city of concord and the
 
05:41:45.190 --> 05:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
minority plan has
 
05:41:47.350 --> 05:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
two towns of the city of concord for the
 
05:41:49.030 --> 05:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
same population
 
05:41:50.830 --> 05:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
we think that the
 
05:41:54.548 --> 05:41:54.558 align:start position:0%
majority maps are more appropriate
 
05:41:57.750 --> 05:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:00.070 --> 05:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
05:42:02.150 --> 05:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
more appropriate and more representative

the member from seabrook representative
 
05:57:00.628 --> 05:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
abramson is recognized to speak in
 
05:57:02.868 --> 05:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
support of the committee report
 
05:57:05.030 --> 05:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr speaker i rise in favor
 
05:57:06.788 --> 05:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
of the motion for interim study on house
 
05:57:10.230 --> 05:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
bill 592 bonds for vaccines
 
05:57:13.030 --> 05:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh we found during the uh the hearing
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
only six percent of those suffering from
 
05:57:14.878 --> 05:57:17.030 align:start position:0%
only six percent of those suffering from
vax

05:57:17.030 --> 05:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
vax
 
05:57:18.948 --> 05:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
from vaccine injuries
 
05:57:21.670 --> 05:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
mostly children resulted in compensation
 
05:57:24.470 --> 05:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
from the federal vaccine fund
 
05:57:26.390 --> 05:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
and only after many years of costly
 
05:57:26.400 --> 05:57:27.910 align:start position:0%
and only after many years of costly
litigation

05:57:27.910 --> 05:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
05:57:30.628 --> 05:57:30.638 align:start position:0%
children suffering brain damage autism
 
05:57:32.868 --> 05:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
and other medical complications need
 
05:57:35.030 --> 05:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
medical help now so the republicans on
 
05:57:36.788 --> 05:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
commerce felt that some solution needed
 
05:57:38.788 --> 05:57:38.798 align:start position:0%
to be found to help these families
 
05:57:38.798 --> 05:57:40.628 align:start position:0%
to be found to help these families
sooner

05:57:40.628 --> 05:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
sooner
 
05:57:42.628 --> 05:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
so for that reason i'm asking members to
 
05:57:44.150 --> 05:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
press the green button and support the
 
05:57:48.548 --> 05:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you the member from concord
 
05:57:51.830 --> 05:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett is recognized to
 
05:57:53.990 --> 05:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
speak against the committee report
 
05:57:57.110 --> 05:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i'm over here on
 
05:57:57.120 --> 05:57:59.590 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i'm over here on
1a

05:57:59.590 --> 05:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
1a
 
05:58:01.510 --> 05:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
i rise before you to speak against the
 
05:58:03.350 --> 05:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation to refer for interim
 
05:58:03.360 --> 05:58:04.310 align:start position:0%
recommendation to refer for interim
study

05:58:04.310 --> 05:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
study
 
05:58:06.150 --> 05:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
there are many flaws in this bill that
 
05:58:09.430 --> 05:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
no amount of amending it could could fix
 
05:58:11.270 --> 05:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
first the sponsor admitted that he
 
05:58:13.110 --> 05:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
didn't understand what a bond is in its
 
05:58:13.120 --> 05:58:14.708 align:start position:0%
didn't understand what a bond is in its
purpose

05:58:14.708 --> 05:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
05:58:16.708 --> 05:58:16.718 align:start position:0%
next a billion dollar bond is not
 
05:58:18.230 --> 05:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
obtainable in any market for this
 
05:58:18.240 --> 05:58:19.830 align:start position:0%
obtainable in any market for this
purpose

05:58:19.830 --> 05:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
05:58:21.350 --> 05:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
third we know that vaccines have
 
05:58:23.190 --> 05:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
prevented terrible diseases such as
 
05:58:25.910 --> 05:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
smallpox measles and polio these are
 
05:58:28.310 --> 05:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
diseases of the past
 
05:58:30.470 --> 05:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
this bill may be aiming at the current
 
05:58:32.628 --> 05:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
pandemic but the unintended consequences
 
05:58:34.948 --> 05:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
of this type of broad sweep for any
 
05:58:37.670 --> 05:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine is so very dangerous
 
05:58:39.270 --> 05:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
why would the new hampshire legislature
 
05:58:40.788 --> 05:58:40.798 align:start position:0%
want to make it more difficult for
 
05:58:42.708 --> 05:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies to distribute
 
05:58:42.718 --> 05:58:44.470 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies to distribute
vaccines

05:58:44.470 --> 05:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
05:58:46.470 --> 05:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not up here to defend the profits of
 
05:58:48.310 --> 05:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
the large pharmaceutical companies but i
 
05:58:50.470 --> 05:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
don't believe that setting up another
 
05:58:52.830 --> 05:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
state agency or fund is a viable
 
05:58:55.750 --> 05:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
answer administering such a program fund
 
05:58:58.070 --> 05:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
to compensate anyone who might want to
 
05:58:59.430 --> 05:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
make a claim
 
05:59:01.030 --> 05:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
preempting the national vaccine
 
05:59:02.788 --> 05:59:02.798 align:start position:0%
compensation program
 
05:59:05.670 --> 05:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
would also be a huge hurdle to overcome
 
05:59:07.510 --> 05:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
there's no money in the budget for such
 
05:59:09.670 --> 05:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
a program nor is there consideration for
 
05:59:11.430 --> 05:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
how the dhhs
 
05:59:13.750 --> 05:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
could possibly respond
 
05:59:15.430 --> 05:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
there's no mechanism in the bill for
 
05:59:17.270 --> 05:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
determining a medical condition from a
 
05:59:19.110 --> 05:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine reaction
 
05:59:20.548 --> 05:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
would you just tell your doctor that
 
05:59:21.750 --> 05:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
you're not feeling well from your
 
05:59:23.350 --> 05:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine and the state would give you
 
05:59:23.360 --> 05:59:24.788 align:start position:0%
vaccine and the state would give you
money

05:59:24.788 --> 05:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:59:26.230 --> 05:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
nor is there any provision for
 
05:59:28.548 --> 05:59:28.558 align:start position:0%
determining a fraudulent claim
 
05:59:30.548 --> 05:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
nor which state agency would be
 
05:59:32.868 --> 05:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
responsible for investigating
 
05:59:35.350 --> 05:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
how would dhhs know how to investigate
 
05:59:36.390 --> 05:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
such a claim
 
05:59:38.230 --> 05:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
can i can i ask the members to spend for
 
05:59:39.430 --> 05:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
a moment
 
05:59:41.110 --> 05:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's a bit noisy in here and the member
 
05:59:43.990 --> 05:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
has a right to be heard so let's give
 
05:59:45.510 --> 05:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
her that right i apologize
 
05:59:47.270 --> 05:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative please continue thank you
 
05:59:47.280 --> 05:59:48.830 align:start position:0%
representative please continue thank you
mr

05:59:48.830 --> 05:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
mr
 
05:59:51.830 --> 05:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
speaker bill requires a turnaround time
 
05:59:53.670 --> 05:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
of 15 days
 
05:59:55.510 --> 05:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
from the date of receipt of a claim to
 
05:59:57.670 --> 05:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
payment it's completely unreasonable
 
05:59:59.590 --> 05:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
without due process
 
06:00:01.350 --> 06:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
the bill is trying to set up a pool of
 
06:00:03.430 --> 06:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
money from which money people can draw
 
06:00:05.670 --> 06:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
from without oversight and without the
 
06:00:07.110 --> 06:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
structure that would be necessary to
 
06:00:09.750 --> 06:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
make this a meaningful program
 
06:00:11.510 --> 06:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing many spoke in
 
06:00:13.350 --> 06:00:13.360 align:start position:0%
opposition with pointed questions to
 
06:00:15.190 --> 06:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
which there were no answers
 
06:00:16.868 --> 06:00:16.878 align:start position:0%
no other states are concurrently
 
06:00:18.948 --> 06:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
considering such an action
 
06:00:21.030 --> 06:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
please vote down the motion so another
 
06:00:23.910 --> 06:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
motion can be brought forward thank you
 
06:00:26.070 --> 06:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
thank you the member from wentworth
 
06:00:28.070 --> 06:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative greeson is recognized to
 
06:00:30.788 --> 06:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
speak in support of the committee report
 
06:00:32.470 --> 06:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker and members of the
 
06:00:35.110 --> 06:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
house house bill 592 is intended to
 
06:00:37.030 --> 06:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
provide new hampshire residents with
 
06:00:38.948 --> 06:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
protection against injury caused by
 
06:00:38.958 --> 06:00:40.390 align:start position:0%
protection against injury caused by
vaccinations

06:00:40.390 --> 06:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
06:00:42.708 --> 06:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
now nothing about this bill
 
06:00:45.430 --> 06:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
or its sponsor and supporters should be
 
06:00:47.350 --> 06:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
slandered with the pejorative of
 
06:00:47.360 --> 06:00:48.948 align:start position:0%
slandered with the pejorative of
anti-vaxx

06:00:48.948 --> 06:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
anti-vaxx
 
06:00:51.750 --> 06:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is not covet-centric although
 
06:00:53.910 --> 06:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
it does apply to covid
 
06:00:55.510 --> 06:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
now advancements in medicine have
 
06:00:57.590 --> 06:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
resulted in vaccines being developed
 
06:00:59.270 --> 06:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
that have helped minimize the effects
 
06:01:00.788 --> 06:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
and spread of some of the deadliest
 
06:01:03.510 --> 06:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
viruses ever to plague the planet so
 
06:01:05.430 --> 06:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
there is value to vaccines no one is
 
06:01:07.910 --> 06:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
denying that but as with every medicine
 
06:01:10.628 --> 06:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
or vaccine there are potential risks
 
06:01:12.868 --> 06:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
no vaccine or medicine is 100 percent
 
06:01:14.628 --> 06:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
effective and some people will
 
06:01:16.788 --> 06:01:16.798 align:start position:0%
experience significant side effects even
 
06:01:16.798 --> 06:01:17.830 align:start position:0%
experience significant side effects even
death

06:01:17.830 --> 06:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
death
 
06:01:19.830 --> 06:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
the national institutes for health state
 
06:01:22.788 --> 06:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
that more than 1.5 million people are
 
06:01:25.510 --> 06:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
hospitalized every year because of quote
 
06:01:28.470 --> 06:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
adverse drug reactions unquote meaning
 
06:01:30.548 --> 06:01:30.558 align:start position:0%
side effects from medications
 
06:01:32.230 --> 06:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
and approximately one hundred thousand
 
06:01:34.548 --> 06:01:34.558 align:start position:0%
patients die from drugs uh drug side
 
06:01:34.558 --> 06:01:35.670 align:start position:0%
patients die from drugs uh drug side
effects

06:01:35.670 --> 06:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
effects
 
06:01:38.230 --> 06:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
however according to forty two u s codes
 
06:01:40.868 --> 06:01:40.878 align:start position:0%
subsection three hundred no vaccine
 
06:01:43.670 --> 06:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturer shall be liable in a civil
 
06:01:45.750 --> 06:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
action for damages arising from a
 
06:01:47.830 --> 06:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine-related injury or death
 
06:01:49.830 --> 06:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
associated with the administration of a
 
06:01:54.070 --> 06:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine after october 1 1988. if the
 
06:01:56.070 --> 06:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
injury or death resulted from side
 
06:01:57.910 --> 06:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
effects that were unavoidable even
 
06:02:00.230 --> 06:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
though the vaccine was properly prepared
 
06:02:02.548 --> 06:02:02.558 align:start position:0%
and was accompanied by proper directions
 
06:02:03.910 --> 06:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
and warnings
 
06:02:06.070 --> 06:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
the national vaccine injury compensation
 
06:02:08.230 --> 06:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
program was subsequently developed to
 
06:02:10.390 --> 06:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
handle vaccine injury claims because

funding for the national vaccine injury
 
06:02:37.990 --> 06:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
compensation program comes from a 75

cent dose per uh per dose tax on every

dose of vaccine administered for every

disease being vaccinated against so that
 
06:02:48.788 --> 06:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
means that mmr measles mumps and rubella
 
06:02:52.070 --> 06:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
would have 2.25 tax applied because it
 
06:02:55.190 --> 06:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
covers 75 cents for measles 75 cents for

mumps and 75 cents for rubella
 
06:03:00.548 --> 06:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
the national vaccine injury compensation
 
06:03:02.788 --> 06:03:02.798 align:start position:0%
program only covers
 
06:03:05.830 --> 06:03:05.840 align:start position:0%

shots
 
06:03:09.750 --> 06:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
but it was only in 2006 that the flu
 
06:03:12.070 --> 06:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
shot started being covered and adults
 
06:03:14.150 --> 06:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
injured by a flu shot could also file a
 
06:03:14.160 --> 06:03:15.190 align:start position:0%
injured by a flu shot could also file a
petition

06:03:15.190 --> 06:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
petition
 
06:03:19.670 --> 06:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
and since 2006 5 351 claims have been
 
06:03:24.070 --> 06:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
paid out of 23 619 petitions filed for
 
06:03:26.310 --> 06:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
injuries due to flu shots
 
06:03:29.190 --> 06:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
this means since the program's inception
 
06:03:31.990 --> 06:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
over 60 percent of all paid claims have
 
06:03:34.788 --> 06:03:34.798 align:start position:0%
been since 2006 and were for adults
 
06:03:36.628 --> 06:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
injured as a result of receiving flu
 
06:03:36.638 --> 06:03:37.990 align:start position:0%
injured as a result of receiving flu
shots

06:03:37.990 --> 06:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
shots
 
06:03:39.430 --> 06:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
now the national vaccine injury
 
06:03:42.230 --> 06:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
compensation does not a program does not
 
06:03:44.390 --> 06:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
cover all vaccines
 
06:03:46.708 --> 06:03:46.718 align:start position:0%
it does not cover shingles pneumococcal
 
06:03:49.030 --> 06:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
pneumonia off-season flu shots and
 
06:03:50.310 --> 06:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
several others
 
06:03:52.070 --> 06:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
and because the national vaccine injury
 
06:03:54.708 --> 06:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
compensation program does not cover all
 
06:03:57.190 --> 06:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
vaccines people may be injured by a
 
06:04:00.470 --> 06:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine and have no recourse whatsoever
 
06:04:02.070 --> 06:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
and it should be noted that the national
 
06:04:04.470 --> 06:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury compensation program does
 
06:04:06.708 --> 06:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
not cover the kovid shot
 
06:04:09.590 --> 06:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
and this is where house goal 592 becomes
 
06:04:13.510 --> 06:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
important one house bill 592
 
06:04:16.230 --> 06:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
could be amended to apply all vacci
 
06:04:19.030 --> 06:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
apply to all vaccines authorized for use
 
06:04:20.708 --> 06:04:20.718 align:start position:0%
under the emergency use
 
06:04:23.830 --> 06:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
authorization including those for covid
 
06:04:25.910 --> 06:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
it could be amended to
 
06:04:27.430 --> 06:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
compensate new hampshire residents
 
06:04:29.910 --> 06:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
injured by a vaccine not covered by the
 
06:04:31.670 --> 06:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
national vaccine injury compensation
 
06:04:31.680 --> 06:04:32.868 align:start position:0%
national vaccine injury compensation
program

06:04:32.868 --> 06:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:04:34.390 --> 06:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
following discussions with multiple
 
06:04:36.230 --> 06:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury attorneys it was
 
06:04:38.390 --> 06:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
determined that house bill 592 would be
 
06:04:40.868 --> 06:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
a beneficial program if it were amended
 
06:04:43.830 --> 06:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
to cover only vaccines not covered by
 
06:04:45.670 --> 06:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
the national program because when
 
06:04:47.670 --> 06:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
someone files a petition with the
 
06:04:49.510 --> 06:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
national program they must declare
 
06:04:51.590 --> 06:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not they've already received
 
06:04:53.910 --> 06:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
any compensation for their injury
 
06:04:56.628 --> 06:04:56.638 align:start position:0%
any compensation under house bill 592
 
06:04:58.868 --> 06:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
could and would most likely interfere
 
06:05:00.708 --> 06:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
with the national program and that is an
 
06:05:03.110 --> 06:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
undesired consequence
 
06:05:05.430 --> 06:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
additionally concerns arose during work
 
06:05:07.270 --> 06:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
sessions regarding the funding mechanism
 
06:05:09.430 --> 06:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
for this program a better funding
 
06:05:11.350 --> 06:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
mechanism would be needed than a bond
 
06:05:13.270 --> 06:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
such as a per dose fee
 
06:05:14.948 --> 06:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
insulting the intelligence of the
 
06:05:17.030 --> 06:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill does not solve
 
06:05:17.040 --> 06:05:18.390 align:start position:0%

anything

06:05:18.390 --> 06:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
anything
 
06:05:20.230 --> 06:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
given that there are still some details
 
06:05:22.788 --> 06:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
that need work but the overall validity
 
06:05:25.110 --> 06:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
and usefulness of this bill remains the
 
06:05:26.628 --> 06:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
majority of the commerce committee has
 
06:05:29.430 --> 06:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
agreed to refer house bill 592 for
 
06:05:31.590 --> 06:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
interim study to determine how best to
 
06:05:33.910 --> 06:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
proceed and i hope everyone will agree
 
06:05:35.830 --> 06:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
with the majority and allow house bill
 
06:05:38.788 --> 06:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
592 to go to interim study and have the
 
06:05:40.470 --> 06:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
details worked out because vaccine
 
06:05:42.948 --> 06:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
injuries can occur to anyone regardless

they're already standing there so i can
 
06:06:29.670 --> 06:06:29.680 align:start position:0%

interim study
 
06:12:03.590 --> 06:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
this bill has been heard before the
 
06:12:05.990 --> 06:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
house and senate in the past and both
 
06:12:08.628 --> 06:12:08.638 align:start position:0%
times passed by voice vote but lost in
 
06:12:11.350 --> 06:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
the omnibus bill of 2020.
 
06:12:13.510 --> 06:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
the bill simply requires an employer to

of existing law
 
06:12:25.750 --> 06:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
but this bill would consolidate
 
06:12:27.990 --> 06:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination for pregnancy-caused
 
06:12:32.070 --> 06:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
issues into one location in the statute
 
06:12:34.390 --> 06:12:34.400 align:start position:0%

and new work situations
 
06:12:47.350 --> 06:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
there is a hardship clause included for
 
06:12:49.270 --> 06:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
any employer that can demonstrate that
 
06:12:51.190 --> 06:12:51.200 align:start position:0%

desperately trying to find employees why
 
06:13:01.270 --> 06:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
would the new hampshire legislature want
 
06:13:03.030 --> 06:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
to make it more difficult for a pregnant

woman in the workplace
 
06:13:08.150 --> 06:13:08.160 align:start position:0%

employer charges and 74

the new hampshire commission for human
 
06:13:17.430 --> 06:13:17.440 align:start position:0%

the commission does not provide legal
 
06:13:31.190 --> 06:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
advice nor do they want to take sides
 
06:13:33.030 --> 06:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
even with positive outcomes from the

for pregnancy related issues in one
 
06:13:42.310 --> 06:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
place that is clear concise and easy to
 
06:13:44.628 --> 06:13:44.638 align:start position:0%
find should be the aim for any law
 
06:13:46.470 --> 06:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it
 
06:13:48.470 --> 06:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's helpful for any employer looking to
 
06:13:50.470 --> 06:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
comply too
 
06:13:51.990 --> 06:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
for those of us who have been pregnant
 
06:13:53.990 --> 06:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
there are some inconveniences about this
 
06:13:56.310 --> 06:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
temporary condition
 
06:13:58.150 --> 06:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
most employers want to do the right
 
06:14:00.948 --> 06:14:00.958 align:start position:0%
thing and may just need some guidance
 
06:14:02.548 --> 06:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
the commission is not there with a
 
06:14:04.150 --> 06:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
sledgehammer and we know they're not
 
06:14:05.910 --> 06:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
looking to go to court for unnecessary

looking to go to court for unnecessary
reasons

06:14:07.750 --> 06:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
06:14:09.990 --> 06:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
clarifying the discrimination statute is
 
06:14:13.110 --> 06:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
a win-win for all sides the employee
 
06:14:15.270 --> 06:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
the employer and the public

including other uh
 
06:14:43.990 --> 06:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
others plus other members of the house
 
06:14:46.150 --> 06:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
repeatedly testified that all this bill
 
06:14:48.628 --> 06:14:48.638 align:start position:0%
would do is copy portions of current
 
06:14:51.430 --> 06:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
laws as written in different rsas and
 
06:14:53.910 --> 06:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
place them in one location however
 
06:14:55.830 --> 06:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
despite testimony saying this law would
 
06:14:57.910 --> 06:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
not actually change anything
 
06:14:59.910 --> 06:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
all references to the new location and
 
06:15:02.230 --> 06:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
statute would put this bill under
 
06:15:04.310 --> 06:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
workers compensation laws all references
 
06:15:06.708 --> 06:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
were the workers compensation laws and
 
06:15:08.548 --> 06:15:08.558 align:start position:0%
it would introduce changes making
 
06:15:11.270 --> 06:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
pregnancy a compensable disability now
 
06:15:12.868 --> 06:15:12.878 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how one gets pregnant at
 
06:15:14.948 --> 06:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
work but that's a different issue
 
06:15:16.788 --> 06:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
due to the potential conflict the
 
06:15:18.230 --> 06:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
majority of the commerce committee
 
06:15:21.190 --> 06:15:21.200 align:start position:0%

to be done
 
06:15:26.948 --> 06:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
who needs to do it and where in statute

my parliamentary inquiry is an actual
 
06:19:02.390 --> 06:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry if this bill is
 
06:19:04.628 --> 06:19:04.638 align:start position:0%
laid on the table uh when is the
 
06:19:07.510 --> 06:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take it off the table
 
06:19:08.708 --> 06:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
could it be taken off the table
 
06:19:10.708 --> 06:19:10.718 align:start position:0%
theoretically tomorrow or is there a
 
06:19:12.468 --> 06:19:12.478 align:start position:0%
time limit
 
06:19:17.990 --> 06:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:19.030 --> 06:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and
 
06:19:20.548 --> 06:19:20.558 align:start position:0%
bills have come off the table the
 
06:19:22.310 --> 06:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
deadline you want to look at is in this
 
06:19:24.868 --> 06:19:24.878 align:start position:0%
case last day to act on senate bills
 
06:19:26.708 --> 06:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
so before that you can still do
 
06:19:28.310 --> 06:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
something with it all right thank you
 
06:19:35.430 --> 06:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:36.948 --> 06:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
so the question before the house is
 
06:19:40.230 --> 06:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
whether to table senate bill 69 this is
 
06:19:42.390 --> 06:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
a division vote members should be in
 
06:19:49.350 --> 06:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:49.360 --> 06:19:54.948 align:start position:0%
 
yep

06:19:54.948 --> 06:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:56.548 --> 06:19:56.558 align:start position:0%
representative weston's recognized for
 
06:19:58.468 --> 06:19:58.478 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
06:20:01.030 --> 06:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:20:03.590 --> 06:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
if i know that in these times of short
 
06:20:04.708 --> 06:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
labor to
 
06:20:07.350 --> 06:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
supply we need to respect the needs of
 
06:20:10.070 --> 06:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
every worker including new mothers to
 
06:20:12.070 --> 06:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
keep them in the workforce
 
06:20:14.230 --> 06:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
and if i know that babies flourish on
 
06:20:16.150 --> 06:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
their mother's milk during their first
 
06:20:17.350 --> 06:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
year of life
 
06:20:19.270 --> 06:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
and everyone in new hampshire wants
 
06:20:21.110 --> 06:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
healthy babies
 
06:20:23.190 --> 06:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
and if i know that tabling this bill
 
06:20:25.430 --> 06:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
will deny this house the opportunity to
 
06:20:28.468 --> 06:20:28.478 align:start position:0%
discuss the merits of the bill
 
06:20:31.110 --> 06:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
then would i not push the red button to
 
06:20:34.708 --> 06:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
defeat the tabling motion
 
06:20:36.468 --> 06:20:36.478 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rice is

thank you mr speaker
 
06:20:47.590 --> 06:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
if i know that sb 69 is an unfunded
 
06:20:49.910 --> 06:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
mandate on municipalities and schools
 
06:20:53.270 --> 06:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
would i now vote green to table sb69
 
06:20:55.110 --> 06:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:20:56.230 --> 06:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:20:58.390 --> 06:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to lay sent bill
 
06:21:01.030 --> 06:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
69 on the table this is a division vote
 
06:21:02.390 --> 06:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor of laying it on the
 
06:21:04.390 --> 06:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
table you'll press the green button if
 
06:21:05.750 --> 06:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're opposed you'll press the red

same report the same with the
 
06:29:51.510 --> 06:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
06:29:53.350 --> 06:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
pass representative conley for the
 
06:29:55.990 --> 06:29:56.000 align:start position:0%

um
 
06:30:00.948 --> 06:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
we had a point of order
 
06:30:05.030 --> 06:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah we're on uh 238 but we have 237 on
 
06:30:07.030 --> 06:30:07.040 align:start position:0%

06:30:08.468 --> 06:30:08.478 align:start position:0%
to quote a good friend and colleague go
 
06:30:10.390 --> 06:30:10.400 align:start position:0%

06:30:16.708 --> 06:30:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:24.708 --> 06:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:25.910 --> 06:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
the majority of the committee on
 
06:30:27.510 --> 06:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and public safety to
 
06:30:31.350 --> 06:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
which was referred house bill 237 fna
 
06:30:33.350 --> 06:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
an act relative to the legalization and
 
06:30:34.948 --> 06:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
regulation of cannabis and making
 
06:30:36.948 --> 06:30:36.958 align:start position:0%
appropriations therefore having
 
06:30:38.468 --> 06:30:38.478 align:start position:0%
considered the same report the same with
 
06:30:39.910 --> 06:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that the bill be
 
06:30:41.590 --> 06:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
referred for interim study
 
06:30:43.110 --> 06:30:43.120 align:start position:0%

majority of the committee
 
06:30:46.548 --> 06:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
the major the minority of the committee
 
06:30:47.910 --> 06:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
having considered the same and being
 
06:30:50.230 --> 06:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
unable to agree with the majority report
 
06:30:51.670 --> 06:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
with the recommendation that the bill
 
06:30:53.350 --> 06:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
ought to pass representative cainley
 
06:30:55.590 --> 06:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
casey conley for the minority of the
 
06:30:55.600 --> 06:31:00.070 align:start position:0%
casey conley for the minority of the
committee

06:31:00.070 --> 06:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:01.990 --> 06:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
the member from dover representative
 
06:31:03.830 --> 06:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
conley is recognized to speak against
 
06:31:06.310 --> 06:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
the committee report
 
06:31:08.230 --> 06:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:31:10.230 --> 06:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
mr speaker i do rise today against the
 
06:31:18.230 --> 06:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:20.548 --> 06:31:20.558 align:start position:0%
it's it's getting pretty noisy in here
 
06:31:21.670 --> 06:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
i'm right here and i'm having trouble
 
06:31:23.990 --> 06:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
hearing them
 
06:31:26.788 --> 06:31:26.798 align:start position:0%
remember i was alright to be heard
 
06:31:28.788 --> 06:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:31:30.628 --> 06:31:30.638 align:start position:0%
uh so as i was saying a nearly identical
 
06:31:32.230 --> 06:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
version of this bill came before this
 
06:31:34.390 --> 06:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
very house two years ago
 
06:31:36.070 --> 06:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
it passed this house with strong
 
06:31:37.990 --> 06:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support
 
06:31:40.548 --> 06:31:40.558 align:start position:0%
this is not a bill that needs more study
 
06:31:42.468 --> 06:31:42.478 align:start position:0%
this bill would create a mechanism to
 
06:31:45.430 --> 06:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
legalize regulate and tax recreational
 
06:31:48.788 --> 06:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis for adults 21 and older it sets
 
06:31:50.310 --> 06:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable limits
 
06:31:51.750 --> 06:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
for the possession of cannabis and
 
06:31:53.830 --> 06:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis products that are consistent
 
06:31:56.628 --> 06:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
with personal use
 
06:31:58.868 --> 06:31:58.878 align:start position:0%
it supports private enterprise and it
 
06:32:00.548 --> 06:32:00.558 align:start position:0%
creates a framework to determine who
 
06:32:02.548 --> 06:32:02.558 align:start position:0%
could sell this product where these
 
06:32:04.708 --> 06:32:04.718 align:start position:0%
stores could be located and how these
 
06:32:07.110 --> 06:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
businesses would be regulated
 
06:32:08.788 --> 06:32:08.798 align:start position:0%
it establishes a framework for how
 
06:32:11.430 --> 06:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis revenue would be allocated
 
06:32:13.350 --> 06:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
the estimated 40 million dollars a year
 
06:32:15.510 --> 06:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
in new revenue would pay for substance
 
06:32:17.350 --> 06:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
misuse programs it would go to the
 
06:32:19.350 --> 06:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
general fund and it would help offset
 
06:32:23.590 --> 06:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:26.070 --> 06:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
finally this bill restricts advertising
 
06:32:27.750 --> 06:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
of cannabis and cannabis related
 
06:32:30.070 --> 06:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
products it's a complex bill it takes up
 
06:32:32.230 --> 06:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
nearly 30 pages
 
06:32:34.708 --> 06:32:34.718 align:start position:0%
but it's a finely detailed bill to
 
06:32:36.788 --> 06:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
govern how a legalization structure
 
06:32:40.390 --> 06:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:42.310 --> 06:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
the framework contained in this did not
 
06:32:45.030 --> 06:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
emerge out of thin air in fact the bill
 
06:32:46.468 --> 06:32:46.478 align:start position:0%
before you incorporates key
 
06:32:48.150 --> 06:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the state's own
 
06:32:50.310 --> 06:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis study commission which offered
 
06:32:52.788 --> 06:32:52.798 align:start position:0%
a road map and best practices for how to
 
06:32:55.350 --> 06:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
legalize and regulate cannabis for adult
 
06:32:55.360 --> 06:32:56.390 align:start position:0%
legalize and regulate cannabis for adult
use

06:32:56.390 --> 06:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
use
 
06:32:58.708 --> 06:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
those best practices and that road map
 
06:33:01.190 --> 06:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
are the core of this bill
 
06:33:02.868 --> 06:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
everyone in this room is aware that new
 
06:33:04.468 --> 06:33:04.478 align:start position:0%
hampshire is an island of cannabis
 
06:33:04.478 --> 06:33:05.750 align:start position:0%
hampshire is an island of cannabis
prohibition

06:33:05.750 --> 06:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
prohibition
 
06:33:08.230 --> 06:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis is now legal in 18 states blue
 
06:33:10.468 --> 06:33:10.478 align:start position:0%
states red states purple states
 
06:33:12.788 --> 06:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
the sky has not fallen in these places
 
06:33:14.788 --> 06:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents want cannabis to
 
06:33:16.868 --> 06:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
be legal here too we know that because
 
06:33:18.628 --> 06:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
they've told us they want it to be legal
 
06:33:18.638 --> 06:33:19.750 align:start position:0%
they've told us they want it to be legal
here

06:33:19.750 --> 06:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:33:21.750 --> 06:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
the most recent unh poll showed support
 
06:33:25.830 --> 06:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
for legalization has grown to 78
 
06:33:29.990 --> 06:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
78 of our residents want this to pass
 
06:33:31.670 --> 06:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
so with that i ask you again please
 
06:33:34.548 --> 06:33:34.558 align:start position:0%
reject the interim study recommendation
 
06:33:36.230 --> 06:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
so that another more appropriate motion
 
06:33:37.910 --> 06:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
can be made and mr speaker asks for a
 
06:33:39.830 --> 06:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
division vote
 
06:33:40.948 --> 06:33:40.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:33:42.468 --> 06:33:42.478 align:start position:0%
the member from salem representative
 
06:33:43.990 --> 06:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
abbas is recognized to speak in support
 
06:33:46.628 --> 06:33:46.638 align:start position:0%
of the committee report
 
06:33:48.948 --> 06:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:33:50.548 --> 06:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
just to clarify what this bill would
 
06:33:52.390 --> 06:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
actually do we would create
 
06:33:54.788 --> 06:33:54.798 align:start position:0%
two new taxes including a sales tax
 
06:33:57.110 --> 06:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
which completely con contradicts the new
 
06:33:59.750 --> 06:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire advantage it also would create
 
06:34:01.990 --> 06:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
a transfer tax which is
 
06:34:04.788 --> 06:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
kind of similar to a sales tax if you
 
06:34:05.990 --> 06:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
ask me
 
06:34:08.070 --> 06:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
so anyone who took that pledge to not
 
06:34:09.670 --> 06:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
support any new taxes you would be
 
06:34:11.510 --> 06:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
violating that pledge remember suspend
 
06:34:13.350 --> 06:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
for a sec i know it's awkward but
 
06:34:14.548 --> 06:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
they'll hear you better if you speak
 
06:34:16.948 --> 06:34:16.958 align:start position:0%
right into it
 
06:34:18.548 --> 06:34:18.558 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
06:34:20.788 --> 06:34:20.798 align:start position:0%
oh that is much better
 
06:34:23.510 --> 06:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
in addition to that there are several
 
06:34:25.430 --> 06:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
bills that have been filed relating to
 
06:34:27.190 --> 06:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
recreational canvas that my colleague
 
06:34:28.708 --> 06:34:28.718 align:start position:0%
who just spoke actually co-sponsored
 
06:34:29.590 --> 06:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
with me
 
06:34:30.628 --> 06:34:30.638 align:start position:0%
that the
 
06:34:32.230 --> 06:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
criminal justice public safety committee
 
06:34:34.548 --> 06:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
has yet to have a public hearing on and
 
06:34:37.030 --> 06:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
i believe that those bills have a are
 
06:34:38.708 --> 06:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
much more rounded and don't have any new
 
06:34:40.708 --> 06:34:40.718 align:start position:0%
taxes but those haven't obviously been
 
06:34:43.350 --> 06:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
considered yet uh considering what this
 
06:34:44.948 --> 06:34:44.958 align:start position:0%
bill would actually do
 
06:34:46.390 --> 06:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
is create a lot of
 
06:34:48.390 --> 06:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
a large expansion of government that is

not supported by any revenue stream that
 
06:34:53.670 --> 06:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
is sustainable to actually fund that and

that is an unknown unknown in the fiscal
 
06:34:56.240 --> 06:34:57.350 align:start position:0%
that is an unknown unknown in the fiscal
note

06:34:57.350 --> 06:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
note
 
06:34:59.750 --> 06:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
given given that consideration
 
06:35:01.910 --> 06:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
and given that there's a lot of uh reg
 
06:35:04.548 --> 06:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
over regulation of a product
 
06:35:05.910 --> 06:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
and when i say over regulation you
 
06:35:07.590 --> 06:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't put the you would legalize a
 
06:35:08.868 --> 06:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
product but you wouldn't be allowed to
 
06:35:11.830 --> 06:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
put the plant in your window
 
06:35:13.110 --> 06:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
you're only allowed to have you're gonna
 
06:35:15.030 --> 06:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
have a private enterprise that can only
 
06:35:17.910 --> 06:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
sell one ounce of its product at a time
 
06:35:19.590 --> 06:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
yet that is the only product that they
 
06:35:19.600 --> 06:35:20.390 align:start position:0%
yet that is the only product that they
sell

06:35:20.390 --> 06:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
sell
 
06:35:22.468 --> 06:35:22.478 align:start position:0%
that is a recipe for disaster and
 
06:35:23.990 --> 06:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
there's been nothing presented to our
 
06:35:25.990 --> 06:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee to suggest that that type of
 
06:35:28.070 --> 06:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
business model that is over regulated
 
06:35:28.948 --> 06:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
like that
 
06:35:30.468 --> 06:35:30.478 align:start position:0%
is sustainable
 
06:35:33.590 --> 06:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
for that therefore i ask that we support
 
06:35:35.030 --> 06:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
the committee recommendation interim
 
06:35:37.270 --> 06:35:37.280 align:start position:0%

putting people in prison and turning

thank you mr speaker if i know that a

bill that i am the prime sponsor of
 
06:42:36.150 --> 06:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
would allow recreational cannabis but
 
06:42:38.310 --> 06:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
not have a sales tax
 
06:42:40.948 --> 06:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
and mr speaker if i know
 
06:42:44.548 --> 06:42:44.558 align:start position:0%
that hb 237 actually has a sales tax and
 
06:42:46.708 --> 06:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
a transfer tax
 
06:42:49.350 --> 06:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
and and mr speaker alaska i know that

this bill
 
06:42:52.310 --> 06:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
is it would likely be assigned to
 
06:42:54.948 --> 06:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
another committee and the non-sales tax
 
06:42:57.110 --> 06:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
bill would probably be
 
06:42:58.708 --> 06:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
voted on in our committee a criminal
 
06:43:00.390 --> 06:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
