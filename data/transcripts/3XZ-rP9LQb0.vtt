00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay we'll open up the hearing for hb uh
 
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
the committee conference on hb1106
 
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
and what i'm going to do is go to the
 
00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 align:start position:0%
senate there on this amendment here
 
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
because you really have us confused
 
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
on what this commission of demographic
 
00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
trends out i mean where and whether this
 
00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
even came to the house
 
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative
 
00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
if i may speak for the senate
 
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
um in hb2 of last year
 
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
we removed an ongoing commission that
 
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
was crea that started in 2018
 
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
by we i mean we accidentally approved it
 
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
um when the office of strategic
 
00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
initiatives split up into the department
 
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
of energy and business and economic
 
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.309 align:start position:0%
of energy and business and economic
affairs

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
affairs
 
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
it was my understanding that they didn't
 
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.390 align:start position:0%
it was my understanding that they didn't
fund

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's been historically
 
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
they have not funded a position
 
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
for the state demographer that we
 
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
authorized in 2018
 
00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 align:start position:0%
as a legislative body
 
00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 align:start position:0%
and that authorization
 
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
also created the commission on
 
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
demographic trends and required some of
 
00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 align:start position:0%
our state and agencies to create 10-year
 
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
current service budget so we can start
 
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
to look at a state
 
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
long term
 
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
so in the hb2 of last year
 
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
when i when we saw the
 
00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
demographic commission line
 
00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
i just assumed it was taking out the
 
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
funding for the state demographer as we
 
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
had done previously
 
00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
however a representative brought it to
 
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
our attention
 
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
that it actually took away the entire
 
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.390 align:start position:0%
that it actually took away the entire
commission

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
and the commission has been meeting
 
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
it has four representatives on it has
 
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
governor appointees on it
 
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.229 align:start position:0%
governor appointees on it
and

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
myself as a senate appointee
 
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
and we've been meeting since 2018 um
 
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a hiatus in the covid times but
 
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't realize that we were not a um
 
00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
ongoing commission any longer the lba
 
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
had been meeting with us they didn't
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
realize it and so i apologize for
 
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
sticking this on your bill
 
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
representative but um i tried to find
 
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
some place where i thought it wouldn't
 
00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
be offensive to anybody but it's a
 
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
commission that is still meeting however
 
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
we should not be meeting because we're
 
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
not actually in statute any longer okay
 
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
so the hp2 it was in hb2 you're saying
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
but it just took it out
 
00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
yes hb2 took it out without us realizing
 
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
it okay
 
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
did uh anyone else have anything on that
 
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
rich uh john
 
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
i think i'm good okay so i was a little
 
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
concerned because i wasn't didn't know
 
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
whether we had a house hearing on it but
 
00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
since it was an hb2
 
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
i guess you had a house hearing on it in
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
2018 and we approved it then right um
 
00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
but we just didn't realize that
 
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
when strategic initiatives split up they
 
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
just deleted the commission
 
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.390 align:start position:0%
just deleted the commission
and

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
the house didn't realize it the senate
 
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
didn't realize it the lba office didn't
 
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
realize it the governor was still
 
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.590 align:start position:0%
realize it the governor was still
appointing

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
appointing
 
00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 align:start position:0%
appointing members to the commission it
 
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
was representative horrigan that pointed
 
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 align:start position:0%
it out to me so
 
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
he was the only one in in the state
 
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
house that realized that it was not an
 
00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
yes senator i'm just curious
 
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.029 align:start position:0%
yes senator i'm just curious
uh

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
what's what's the mission of i mean
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
demographics can be huge
 
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.430 align:start position:0%
 
linda

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
linda
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
so um in in in the amendment um the
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
oh wait that's yours sorry i'm trying to
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
i gave you a side by side there too by
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
oh yes sorry
 
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
so the duties of the commission is to
 
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
look at the
 
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
net migration goals of the state
 
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
um to
 
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
start to reque requires some certain
 
00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
state agencies that will be impacted by
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
changes in demographics to look
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
out ten years versus just doing a
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
two-year budget so start to plan as a
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
state how we what what are the
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
challenges that we're going to be facing
 
00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
like what are the bumps or declines in
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
funding that we're going to see coming
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
forward so that we can not be surprised
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
by budget issues or also that we could
 
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
challenge something saying why is your
 
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
budget increasing when we know that the
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
demographics in this
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
funding pool
 
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
are decreasing things of that nature so
 
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
it's it's more it's a it's a long-term
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
look at things and also a
 
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
um a better way for the legislature to
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
be informed of what this what the state
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
is going to be looking at long term
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
we have some very active
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
government governor appointees on it
 
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.950 align:start position:0%
government governor appointees on it
it's

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
we don't get much attention but it's
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
really an interesting commission
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
and our goal is also to
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
be more interactive with the legislature
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
and we started to do that
 
00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
um in early 2020 and then things kind of
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
stopped and
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
if i may yes
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
i know that new hampshire historically
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
as far as demographic trends
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
were very old state
 
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
but then i saw recently
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
that young people are moving or staying
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the state i'm not sure
 
00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
but that would be a tremendous
 
00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 align:start position:0%
demographic trend that affects housing
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
and affects
 
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.629 align:start position:0%
and affects
uh

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
you know if we're getting younger
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
that's a great thing
 
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
especially for health care and so forth
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
but in the in the we know we have a
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
housing crisis
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
and that impacts young people
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh but uh i i think there's a tremendous
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
need for that particularly in the area i
 
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.469 align:start position:0%
need for that particularly in the area i
mean

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
like i said uh demographics is a big
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
subject or it can be you know you can
 
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
narrow it down but just in that one
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
demographic trend
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
it has long-term impact
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
to a lot of things that we do
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
i agree and it sounds like you would be
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
a great commission member
 
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
well i would be happy to
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
i i used to teach statistics so i enjoy
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
that that sort of numbers you know
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
um you know when it says i was confused
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
when it said
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh net migration goals and i said net
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
migration goals what the devil is that
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh because
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
migration you know is
 
00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.389 align:start position:0%
migration you know is
um

00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
can mean a lot of things yes yeah it's
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
inflow versus outflow of population what
 
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:52.320 align:start position:0%
and births and
 
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.110 align:start position:0%
and births and
so

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
um yes okay um
 
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.829 align:start position:0%
um yes okay um
linda

00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
linda
 
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
um erin i was wondering
 
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to put out a biennial
 
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.670 align:start position:0%
you're going to put out a biennial
scorecard

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
scorecard
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
what would that scorecard consist of
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
who's doing the scorecard and what are
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
you comparing it to so it
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question that
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
biennial scorecard um the first one was
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
due in 2020 and unfortunately that's
 
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
when like at the end of 2020 and that's
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
when we shut down so we haven't actually
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
done that yet
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
but it would be ideally to highlight
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
some of the legislative legislation that
 
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.389 align:start position:0%
the commission
either

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:33.519 align:start position:0%
agreed with or advocated for um it would
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
be to know what we've identified as our
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
net migration goal and currently it's
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
going to be something along the lines
 
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.910 align:start position:0%
going to be something along the lines
it's

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
something more vague to your point that
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
it could be anything and it would be to
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
meet the needs
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the population of our state because
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
right now we don't have enough people to
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
so i i can't tell you what would be in
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
that scorecard as although i um
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
currently chair the commission i
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
probably will not be cheering it again
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
since i'm not running again
 
00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:09.030 align:start position:0%
since i'm not running again
um

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
oh it would be the commission that will
 
00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
put it together okay are there any other
 
00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:13.750 align:start position:0%
put it together okay are there any other
questions

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
end here and it's november 1st 2022 is
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
what it's going to take effect it's 10
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
years right eating that date
 
00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:26.150 align:start position:0%
years right eating that date
yep

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
okay i mean is there going to be a cut
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
off before that or how is that going to
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
continue this date one day
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
so it's it's an ongoing commission
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
that just has to do
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
reports um it doesn't it doesn't have
 
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
any funding oh and one thing i do want
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
to point out is that in the
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
the this version it i did take out the
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
state demographer and so there is no
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
state expenditure for this
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
um the departments have been able to
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
create the 10-year current service plans
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
themselves that was the concern of
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
theirs that they wouldn't know how to do
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
that without a state demographer to do
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
that for them thank you yeah yeah is uh
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
senator french on board with this
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
because he's awful quiet i'm just
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
checking i prefer to be quiet about
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
things i really don't know about
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you all right uh you know some i'm
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
glad that uh i did call the committee
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
conference on this because we were
 
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
confused on it but uh erin you
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
definitely clarified it uh forrest there
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
and i i support it i'm
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%

00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
okay then um i'm going to close
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
unless you have anything else to add to
 
00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:34.150 align:start position:0%
unless you have anything else to add to
it

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
you're good okay for the state reps if
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
you've never said you're going to have
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
to go down
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh to the
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
legislative research legislative office
 
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.550 align:start position:0%
legislative research legislative office
here

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
and sign off on this here that we
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
support hb1106
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
and then i'll write a little statement
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
for the house
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
that in accordance with hb2 it was
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
mistakenly taken out that we're
 
00:11:59.269 --> 00:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
support putting it back
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
okay now close the committee of
 
00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:02.389 align:start position:0%
okay now close the committee of
conference

the next one my other one at one o'clock
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
we're trying to see if we can find
 
01:05:32.309 --> 01:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro but i'll give
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
little known and infrequently seen
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
okay i'm gonna i'm gonna call this
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
committee a conference on
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 1221 to order
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
and let me just start by saying i did a
 
01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
little research on this i i think we all
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
agree to the underlying bill which is
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
reducing the business profits tax
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
01:07:02.549 --> 01:07:02.559 align:start position:0%
from 7.6 to 7.5 percent
 
01:07:02.559 --> 01:07:03.510 align:start position:0%
from 7.6 to 7.5 percent
uh

01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:06.069 --> 01:07:06.079 align:start position:0%
and then i it looks like the genesis of
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment was senate bill 333
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
was pretty much innocuous bill wasn't
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
very complicated bill but on the on our
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
on our side at the house there was a
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
floor amendment
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
that added the
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
7.5 percent uh paid to uh
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
division one in division two
 
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
out of state money
 
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
but going forward forever
 
01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.430 align:start position:0%
but going forward forever
and

01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
again most republicans
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
on our side
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
did not like this idea but there were a
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
few that voted for this
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
one up in the senate and my research
 
01:07:51.349 --> 01:07:51.359 align:start position:0%
says that the 333 was
 
01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:53.190 align:start position:0%
says that the 333 was
was

01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.630 align:start position:0%
was
non-concur

01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
non-concur
 
01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:55.589 align:start position:0%
non-concur
fine

01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm gonna i'm gonna look at senator
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
bradley maybe you can pick up the story
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
from that point uh what happened that
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
you attached this to
 
01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.230 align:start position:0%
you attached this to
uh

01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
a version of this to
 
01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.750 align:start position:0%
a version of this to
1221

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
1221
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um
 
01:08:14.559 --> 01:08:16.309 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair um
so

01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
i mean this started out as
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
trying to get a temporary reduction to
 
01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
the gas tax which
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
um as my colleague to my left will
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
attest and get too far too fast
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
i thought that um
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
the whole purpose of
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
trying to reduce the gas tax was to help
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
people that are struggling right now and
 
01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
it seemed like
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
the 7.5 on a one-year
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
one-time basis while we had the
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
surpluses we were generating was the
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
next best alternative so that was the
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
senate position
 
01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:54.870 align:start position:0%
senate position
um

01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of debate and now i'm
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
just speaking for myself
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
on you know 7.5 percent permanently
 
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
i set it on the senate floor i'll say it
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
here again if we're generating
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know the kind of revenue that we are
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
right now i think you know we should do
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
it but that should be part of next
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
year's budget so what 1221 is is a
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
reduction of the bpt
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
and a one-time 7.5
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
payment to cities and towns for
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
retirement costs that will help property
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and it's accelerated to this
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23. right
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
so the only question i have is
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
how do we know that the cities and towns
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
are actually going to put it to tax
 
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
reduction are we just faith or
 
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
i we don't know i think that center
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
guide added language to it that you know
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
makes it clear that that's what the
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
intent is
 
01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:56.390 align:start position:0%
intent is
um

01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:57.189 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's like anything else when we send
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
money back to
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
um cities and towns
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
you know it's local control
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
run by select boards city councils
 
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:11.030 align:start position:0%
run by select boards city councils
um

01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
so i guess i could
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
expand more upon that but i think i
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
don't need to that's fine yeah
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative lange
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i agree with senator bradley i
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
think that this is the best use that we
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
can possibly we have no control of what
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns we've made it clear
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's one time monies we obviously don't
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
want them to use this for ongoing
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
operational expenses but use for
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
one-time projects that they can they
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
won't have to spend money on in the
 
01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.709 align:start position:0%
won't have to spend money on in the
future

01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
and i think the bpt is again that was a
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
good compromise by the ways and means
 
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
committee the house ways and means
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
committee from the original bill which
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
included bet
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
um i i think that again
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
the smartest move is one-time monies for
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
one-time projects and using our surplus
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
we have now to pay for this in this
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
current year makes absolute sense
 
01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:00.390 align:start position:0%
current year makes absolute sense
okay

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.669 align:start position:0%
okay
so

01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
i don't have a problem with it either
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh the reason i we called a committee a
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
conference is that i had a i had a i
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
mean where ways and means this is a ways
 
01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
and means bill
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh i went to
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
i'll be a legitimate assistant asked
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay what kind of money are we talking
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
about because it wasn't in the belt he
 
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
said around 28 million ish
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
so i said fine uh i went to my
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
leadership because okay is it on your
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
grand plan to spend 28 million on this
 
01:11:28.239 --> 01:11:29.510 align:start position:0%
grand plan to spend 28 million on this
and

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
i finally got that answer
 
01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh but in between we call a committee a
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
conference so
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
i i got clearance to
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
yeah the 28 million is in the plan if
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
you will of all the surplus spending
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to do
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
now some of my colleagues
 
01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:48.870 align:start position:0%
now some of my colleagues
are

01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
well just like most of the of
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
people in our in my party uh did not
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
like the idea of this
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
the larger number going on forever and
 
01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.950 align:start position:0%
the larger number going on forever and
ever

01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
ever
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
you two gentlemen have anything you want
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
to add uh but i think we're gonna i
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
think we're gonna concur with this uh
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
we're gonna
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i think our
 
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.350 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i think our
original

01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
disappointment was that when we looked
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
at the amount 28 million it just so
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
happened that's roughly the amount this
 
01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
bill 1221 started off as a reduction in
 
01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax and the
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax and
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
because there was some concern about um
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
the number of tax reductions we've done
 
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know and covet and everything else
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know where's this whole thing going
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
to come out
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
we put in an amendment and only reduce
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax and now with
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
this attached to it suddenly
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
there's the 28 million again but i
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
certainly understand the idea of trying
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
to in this time of difficulty helping
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
cities and towns um
 
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
with their tax
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
um you know reducing taxes so at this
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
point i
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
i would agree with it
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
you okay yeah
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
okay uh yes
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
just as a commentary
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh another thought in the in the process
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
was that we are in an extremely volatile
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
world and national economy with
 
01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.070 align:start position:0%
world and national economy with
inflation

01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
nominally at eight actually around
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
seventeen percent
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh and so
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
rather than make it seven point five
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
percent contribution permanent
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
it would be better for the next budget
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
cycle when we sit down and determine
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
what the real inns and audi's actually
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
are based on then existing conditions
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
that would be much more appropriate to
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
make a decision such as this to make it
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
permanent after we have a little bit
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
more history on where the economy is
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
going and obviously the impact at four
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
dollars and forty cents a gallon for
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
regular at the pump this morning
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh that's not going to be good so again
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
i think caution is is appropriate i
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
think that one year
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
is a good deal representative lang thank
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you and again i i think it's
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
important to remember uh representative
 
01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.669 align:start position:0%
important to remember uh representative
that

01:13:59.669 --> 01:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
the bpt is an ongoing permanent
 
01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.390 align:start position:0%
the bpt is an ongoing permanent
reduction

01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
whereas the 28 million again because we
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
were concerned about what was going on
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
is just a one-time expenditure and
 
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's why i supported the problem with
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
the bet is a long term and i think
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
senator guy is 100 correct that the
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
volatility of what's going on in our
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
economy we talked about the amount of
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
fake money in our state you know right
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
now with all the various
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
acts that the federal government's done
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
and dumped trillions of dollars out to
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
the market
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
we don't know how that's going to play
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
out long term so i think this is a
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
really smart move to use those one-time
 
01:14:32.719 --> 01:14:33.590 align:start position:0%
really smart move to use those one-time
monies

01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
monies
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
to that we have currently i think my
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
email this morning said we had 287
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
million in in current uh uh surplus so
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
it makes sense to use that million that
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
money to give whatever we can to the
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
towns to help them off on a one-time
 
01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.790 align:start position:0%
towns to help them off on a one-time
basis

01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:51.669 align:start position:0%
basis
okay

01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:14:51.679 --> 01:14:53.270 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
i'll just uh
 
01:14:57.669 --> 01:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
make a motion that we would
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the motion would be
 
01:15:00.149 --> 01:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
out that we would deceit i don't even
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
know if he needed emotions
 
01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.149 align:start position:0%
know if he needed emotions
yes

01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
wang we're going to see
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
second janae again so we're willing to a
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
seed on our side
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
and i i would imagine you would have
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
concur with that ex session
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay well we're going to uh
 
02:02:25.669 --> 02:02:25.679 align:start position:0%
come out of recess on house bill 355
 
02:02:25.679 --> 02:02:28.229 align:start position:0%
come out of recess on house bill 355
and

02:02:28.229 --> 02:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
i've since
 
02:02:32.950 --> 02:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
since the senate called to recess i will
 
02:02:35.109 --> 02:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
look into representative senator goddard
 
02:02:35.119 --> 02:02:36.950 align:start position:0%
look into representative senator goddard
and

02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
tell me anything new from your side
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr noah the senate
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
would still
 
02:02:44.830 --> 02:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
hold its position with respect to the
 
02:02:47.589 --> 02:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
displays and i'll say that the house
 
02:02:50.070 --> 02:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
still holds this position
 
02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:51.510 align:start position:0%
still holds this position
so

02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:54.470 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we're an impasse
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
the house is already compromised as i
 
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
said yesterday
 
02:03:09.030 --> 02:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
this bill came to us and the
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor is sitting here
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't act on it the first
 
02:03:16.629 --> 02:03:16.639 align:start position:0%
year we retained it
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
and then we came up with a compromise
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
within our our committee
 
02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
which was
 
02:03:26.830 --> 02:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
the which is the bill that uh us to for
 
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh um a committee a conference on
 
02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
was we
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
no we asked for the community conference
 
02:03:34.470 --> 02:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
because right
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
you had amended the bill
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know um
 
02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
i mean i i can just react to some of the
 
02:03:47.669 --> 02:03:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:49.990 --> 02:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
mine is a principle stance
 
02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
it isn't like the senators didn't have
 
02:03:53.589 --> 02:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
principal stances you have principal
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
stances too
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
i got one that comes to mind is
 
02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
marijuana recent marijuana bill
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
was very principal stance against
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh and i
 
02:04:06.629 --> 02:04:06.639 align:start position:0%
i you know i testified but then i
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
watched the end of that that hearing
 
02:04:11.109 --> 02:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
back in the office
 
02:04:11.119 --> 02:04:12.550 align:start position:0%
back in the office
and

02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
there were many there were many
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
businesses that wanted this bill to pass
 
02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know even though
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
the state ran the retail
 
02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
but but everything else was private
 
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
sector agriculture you know growing
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
transport testing
 
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
and manufacturing
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i know when i chaired the marijuana
 
02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:34.310 align:start position:0%
and i know when i chaired the marijuana
commission

02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
the agriculture guys were there all the
 
02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:38.790 align:start position:0%
the agriculture guys were there all the
time

02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
wanting to say please
 
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
pass this because this means it means
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
something good for us to have another
 
02:04:47.350 --> 02:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:48.709 align:start position:0%
 
but

02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:04:50.550 --> 02:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
to me
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
i mean i was against the bill too
 
02:04:54.790 --> 02:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
the marijuana bill that we just
 
02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
sent killed
 
02:04:58.629 --> 02:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
but that was principal stance
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
and to me this is a principle stance and
 
02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
that and i'm also
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
as chair i'm also of this group i'm also
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
representing the full
 
02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:08.629 align:start position:0%
representing the full
uh

02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
house ways and means position
 
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
this our senate message came on this
 
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
bill early so we had a chance to talk
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
about this in ways and means
 
02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
and the position was no let's hold our
 
02:05:23.109 --> 02:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
position so i'm not it's not just the
 
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
the four of us here
 
02:05:24.880 --> 02:05:26.310 align:start position:0%
the four of us here
um

02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:26.320 --> 02:05:27.189 align:start position:0%
um
it's

02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%

tim's just sitting here
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:05:34.719 --> 02:05:35.669 align:start position:0%
so uh
and

02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
our our guidance was hold
 
02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
and they knew what the alternative was
 
02:05:42.149 --> 02:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
is if
 
02:05:42.159 --> 02:05:43.350 align:start position:0%
is if
the

02:05:43.350 --> 02:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
of the senate didn't exceed to our
 
02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
position we'd just walk away
 
02:05:47.599 --> 02:05:48.390 align:start position:0%
position we'd just walk away
so

02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh so that's where we're at if if you
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
don't see it if you uh
 
02:05:54.310 --> 02:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
if you if you if you don't want to see
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
our position then we both walk away and
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
the bill dies
 
02:06:00.830 --> 02:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
come back next year
 
02:06:00.840 --> 02:06:02.709 align:start position:0%

02:06:04.709 --> 02:06:04.719 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
02:06:04.719 --> 02:06:06.149 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
um

02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
the only other thing that was said
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday that was uh
 
02:06:10.709 --> 02:06:10.719 align:start position:0%

02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
yes i know
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
i know
 
02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
communities vote opt in to keno
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
but a lot of those communities voted in
 
02:06:20.550 --> 02:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
it was remember was kino garden remember
 
02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
we sold it as kindergarten we were going
 
02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
to pay for kindergarten with this
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that was a factor in
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
towns voting for it
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
but it was also sold as just in
 
02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
establishing stepper liquor
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
so and here now we're going to amend it
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
to be more inclusive of every other
 
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
business that has
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
has a license a a lottery license
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
you know the biggest ones being the
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
grocery stores and the convenience
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
stores but also the drug stores most
 
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
drug stores have them
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:53.750 align:start position:0%
and i i
personally

02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
personally
 
02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
don't like that look but
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
but again those communities didn't
 
02:06:58.800 --> 02:06:59.750 align:start position:0%
but again those communities didn't
really

02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
vote for that that have already voted so
 
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
we're not saying in this bill you have
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
to revoke
 
02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
if you don't want it in your your local
 
02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:07.750 align:start position:0%
if you don't want it in your your local
uh

02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
cvs or you know walmart or whatever
 
02:07:10.719 --> 02:07:11.510 align:start position:0%
cvs or you know walmart or whatever
so

02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
so that's that's
 
02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:15.679 align:start position:0%
and i i think members of
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
the voting members here in the house are
 
02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
pretty unified in that position so i'll
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
i would um
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
ask the chairman upon what principal
 
02:07:30.149 --> 02:07:30.159 align:start position:0%
you base the decision to deny a business
 
02:07:30.159 --> 02:07:31.430 align:start position:0%
you base the decision to deny a business
owner

02:07:31.430 --> 02:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
owner
 
02:07:34.310 --> 02:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
the right to display anything
 
02:07:36.229 --> 02:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
in his or her business
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
i've offered the option of one display
 
02:07:42.149 --> 02:07:42.159 align:start position:0%
limiting the size of the displays
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
to me the principle is
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
we support businesses here
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
this does no harm
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
and i would ask upon what principle you
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
feel you should deny
 
02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
the screen in the store well i i just
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
got done explaining
 
02:07:57.119 --> 02:07:58.470 align:start position:0%
got done explaining
so

02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
you voted against marijuana bill what
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
principle did you use to deny the
 
02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:04.870 align:start position:0%
principle did you use to deny the
growers

02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
growers
 
02:08:06.390 --> 02:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
access to growing marijuana i mean it's
 
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
the same thing we the numbers of the
 
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
marijuana bill are astounding when you
 
02:08:12.870 --> 02:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
offer a person to grow three plants not
 
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
that that's a topic of this discussion
 
02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
the amount that they can produce far
 
02:08:16.639 --> 02:08:17.910 align:start position:0%
the amount that they can produce far
exceeds

02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
exceeds
 
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
what they can use
 
02:08:21.430 --> 02:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
therefore creating an opportunity for
 
02:08:24.069 --> 02:08:24.079 align:start position:0%
sales and and adding to the black market
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
there isn't a child advocacy agency in
 
02:08:27.910 --> 02:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
the country that supports the
 
02:08:29.669 --> 02:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
legalization of marijuana under any
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
premise that's the principle that i use
 
02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
protection of the society right that's
 
02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
one of our obligations i don't see how
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
denying a screen protects society i do
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
see how it offends the right of a
 
02:08:41.030 --> 02:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
business owner
 
02:08:42.870 --> 02:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
to in fact engage in all of her conduct
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
of business well you know we talked
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
about yesterday we talked about
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
look i respect you guys just don't know
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
this is a friendly con little argument
 
02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:51.990 align:start position:0%
this is a friendly con little argument
so

02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
i mean they're
 
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
someone said
 
02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
well they can go to another store if
 
02:08:57.830 --> 02:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
they don't like it
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
but again some of our smaller
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
communities their the next grocery store
 
02:09:02.950 --> 02:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
is 30 miles away
 
02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:04.390 align:start position:0%
is 30 miles away
so

02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
if it's in the store then you're going
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
to say well they voted for this in the
 
02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:08.790 align:start position:0%
to say well they voted for this in the
town

02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
but not everybody voted for it and i
 
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
just think most people don't want to
 
02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
walk into their grocery store and see
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
these screens there
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
as if it's a little mini casino
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
they they don't want that and that's my
 
02:09:21.119 --> 02:09:22.550 align:start position:0%
they they don't want that and that's my
belief

02:09:22.550 --> 02:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
belief
 
02:09:25.510 --> 02:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
so that's my so it's my principle
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
but that's also the belief of my full
 
02:09:27.119 --> 02:09:29.109 align:start position:0%
but that's also the belief of my full
committee

02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
we we would have passed this bill
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
you amended what we we didn't want we we
 
02:09:36.149 --> 02:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
did not want that
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
we amended the bill to we said okay we
 
02:09:40.470 --> 02:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
heard the grocers we heard the
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
the convenience store guys they were
 
02:09:43.750 --> 02:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
very vocal about this
 
02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
that they cashing tickets from
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
restaurants that people leave early they
 
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
want to get the cash we're not getting
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
anything for it so we heard that so the
 
02:09:52.550 --> 02:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
compromise was okay
 
02:09:54.069 --> 02:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
it's just like any other lottery product
 
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
you can do it and you put a little
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
sticker on the window a lot of lottery
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
tickets sold here
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
but not the screens the screens are are
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
just it's a whole different look and
 
02:10:03.119 --> 02:10:05.109 align:start position:0%
just it's a whole different look and
feel

02:10:05.109 --> 02:10:05.119 align:start position:0%
feel
 
02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
can i may mr chair i have not received a
 
02:10:10.550 --> 02:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
single email letter or phone call
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
opposing screens in a grocery store not
 
02:10:16.229 --> 02:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
one i've received numbers of all three
 
02:10:16.239 --> 02:10:17.589 align:start position:0%
one i've received numbers of all three
supporting

02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
the fact that they would like kino
 
02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
i think as a display of the business
 
02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
enterprise of kino i think it's really
 
02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
right it's it's not offensive
 
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
again i think that there's a way to get
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
a compromise which is what we'd like to
 
02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:34.629 align:start position:0%
a compromise which is what we'd like to
see

02:10:34.629 --> 02:10:34.639 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:10:34.639 --> 02:10:35.350 align:start position:0%
see
to

02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
put one screen in
 
02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
limit the size of the screens
 
02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:39.830 align:start position:0%
limit the size of the screens
but

02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:10:42.310 --> 02:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
say no screen and say that that's based
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
on principle
 
02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh i don't i don't agree i think the
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
principle that we operate under in un
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
under live free or die here right it's
 
02:10:52.629 --> 02:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
not it's not harmful if it's
 
02:10:54.629 --> 02:10:54.639 align:start position:0%
objectionable that's a whole different
 
02:10:54.639 --> 02:10:55.510 align:start position:0%
objectionable that's a whole different
game

02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
game
 
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
but it's not possible it was
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
injectionable to be adjustable to a lot
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
of people
 
02:11:02.709 --> 02:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
how many letters did you get
 
02:11:04.390 --> 02:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
i got none
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
most people don't even know what's going
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
on in the state house they have no idea
 
02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
and i know there's a couple of couple of
 
02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:13.270 align:start position:0%
and i know there's a couple of couple of
locations

02:11:13.270 --> 02:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
locations
 
02:11:15.189 --> 02:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
for conversations with
 
02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
with the lottery
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
that would like to see this couple
 
02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:20.950 align:start position:0%
that would like to see this couple
couple

02:11:20.950 --> 02:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
couple
 
02:11:23.109 --> 02:11:23.119 align:start position:0%
did not the entire grocer's association
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
come out in support yeah it's eight
 
02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:25.910 align:start position:0%
come out in support yeah it's eight
percent

02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
why one day it's it's it's money it's
 
02:11:28.159 --> 02:11:30.550 align:start position:0%
why one day it's it's it's money it's
it's

02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:32.550 --> 02:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
no i heard differently that a lot of the
 
02:11:34.470 --> 02:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
big chains would not want this then they
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to take it i know they don't
 
02:11:38.310 --> 02:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
have to take it
 
02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:39.270 align:start position:0%
have to take it
so

02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:40.870 align:start position:0%
so
look

02:11:40.870 --> 02:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
look
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
yeah sponsor can i speak
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
yes you could remember you made the
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so again i i think we
 
02:11:53.430 --> 02:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think we want to get back into i
 
02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
think everybody agreed that in general
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
the bill was a good idea that we want to
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
allow businesses the option
 
02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
to retail that a licensed lottery
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
location is the option to sell keno in
 
02:12:05.270 --> 02:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
places that have already approved
 
02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119 align:start position:0%
keynote i don't think that's up for our
 
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
discussion the only real issue that
 
02:12:12.550 --> 02:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
we're that's the dividing line is
 
02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
the screens
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
is whether or not we allow one screen no
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
screens or or an option for whatever
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
they want to do
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
and i guess i i bring it back is that
 
02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
like the senators and even like yourself
 
02:12:26.310 --> 02:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
as you just admitted
 
02:12:29.589 --> 02:12:29.599 align:start position:0%
i got zero emails in opposition to this
 
02:12:31.589 --> 02:12:31.599 align:start position:0%
bill and i advocated for this bill all
 
02:12:33.189 --> 02:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
across my facebook and all across social
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
media because it was my bill as the
 
02:12:38.390 --> 02:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor i got zero pushback from
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
citizens about the bill and
 
02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
understanding what the bill was
 
02:12:44.550 --> 02:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
um and i recognized i made the motion
 
02:12:46.390 --> 02:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
and i recognize i'm a believer in
 
02:12:48.229 --> 02:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
incrementalism i'll take something over
 
02:12:49.990 --> 02:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
nothing if my only option is nothing and
 
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
in the committee my option was nothing
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
if i pushed it too hard against the may
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
i do think that there were members that
 
02:12:58.950 --> 02:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
were in favor
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
of passing it with the may and not
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
requiring the business shall not but
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
allowing the business to make the
 
02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:06.950 align:start position:0%
allowing the business to make the
decision

02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:13:10.950 --> 02:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
um of the of of their choice and again i
 
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
think it's a reasonable compromise
 
02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
especially from what i've heard where
 
02:13:15.910 --> 02:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
they made a compromise if the concern we
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
heard was that you there was concern
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
about a keynote barn and people throwing
 
02:13:20.950 --> 02:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
up a thousand screens and running keno
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
and grocery as a secondary option um and
 
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's a reasonable compromise if
 
02:13:28.149 --> 02:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
we were to reach a one screen limit um
 
02:13:31.510 --> 02:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
and and say that there it's your your
 
02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
argument of having a kino barn goes away
 
02:13:36.470 --> 02:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
um and it's a it's a reasonable
 
02:13:38.229 --> 02:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
compromise giving the business a choice
 
02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
if they want to put up one screen in
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
their seating area or wherever they want
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
then then that business can make that
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
choice i think that's a reasonable
 
02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
compromise but the full ways and means
 
02:13:49.750 --> 02:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
committee did not agree to that
 
02:13:51.910 --> 02:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
and it's more than me talking here i'm
 
02:13:53.430 --> 02:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
representing the committee
 
02:13:55.750 --> 02:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
we're all representing the committee
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
if you like that idea bring it back next
 
02:13:59.669 --> 02:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
year we'll see how a one screen bill
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
goes i'm not gonna i'm not i'm not i'm
 
02:14:03.830 --> 02:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
not gonna uh
 
02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
proceed yes it's caring
 
02:14:07.750 --> 02:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
um not to get too far off track and i
 
02:14:13.109 --> 02:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate your your position on
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
principle but you know in regard to the
 
02:14:16.709 --> 02:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
marijuana bill
 
02:14:16.719 --> 02:14:17.750 align:start position:0%
marijuana bill
uh

02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
the drug is illegal federally
 
02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:22.149 align:start position:0%
the drug is illegal federally
and

02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
it is our obligation to uphold our
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights
 
02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
of our constituents the the reality of
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
the fact is that you get the right
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
administration in washington and a
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
directive comes down for the ag
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
to enforce the law
 
02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
then everyone who has used marijuana
 
02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:43.270 align:start position:0%
then everyone who has used marijuana
recreational

02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
recreational
 
02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:45.030 align:start position:0%
recreational
medicinal

02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
medicinal
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
or otherwise can be charged with a
 
02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:49.119 align:start position:0%
felony and disarmed
 
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
by the federal government
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
that is my position and that's why i
 
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
have never voted
 
02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
for that you want to get the federal
 
02:14:59.030 --> 02:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
government to to devolve that back to
 
02:15:00.149 --> 02:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
the states
 
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
we can have an honest discussion
 
02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:03.830 align:start position:0%
we can have an honest discussion
about

02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
whether whether marijuana should be
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
a product here in the states but as long
 
02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
as you've got that conflict and we we
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
took an oath
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
basically to not not pass laws that are
 
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
conflicting with the federal government
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
and as long as uh that happens then
 
02:15:22.709 --> 02:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
there's no way that i can change my
 
02:15:22.719 --> 02:15:24.069 align:start position:0%
there's no way that i can change my
position

02:15:24.069 --> 02:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
now i
 
02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
on 355 you know i've
 
02:15:31.589 --> 02:15:31.599 align:start position:0%
been thinking since we we met yesterday
 
02:15:35.030 --> 02:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
as to you know how we might be able to
 
02:15:36.550 --> 02:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
do this but
 
02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
what keeps coming back to me is that we
 
02:15:41.350 --> 02:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
worked really hard last year
 
02:15:43.750 --> 02:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
to come up with a budget that was going
 
02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:45.599 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
an economic engine
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire we did that by by
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
lowering taxes
 
02:15:54.709 --> 02:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh by inviting businesses to come and
 
02:15:56.709 --> 02:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
you know i am aware of
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
of large businesses that are planning on
 
02:16:00.709 --> 02:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
coming to new hampshire i don't know
 
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
where they're going to get their workers
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
but but that's you know
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
that might be a challenge
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
for me on okay how do i draw them from
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
other states or but the fact is they
 
02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
they made a decision
 
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to come to new hampshire
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
and they're going to establish
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
the business here
 
02:16:23.350 --> 02:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
it is our job as legislators to create
 
02:16:25.270 --> 02:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
the opportunity
 
02:16:27.669 --> 02:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
for somebody to establish a business to
 
02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:34.790 --> 02:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
um once they do that it the risk is all
 
02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:36.469 align:start position:0%
um once they do that it the risk is all
theirs

02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
theirs
 
02:16:38.549 --> 02:16:38.559 align:start position:0%
that that business may fail
 
02:16:41.190 --> 02:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm i'm a selectman in the town
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
of milford i remember a time when
 
02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
there was a tattoo uh piler that wanted
 
02:16:48.309 --> 02:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
to come in
 
02:16:48.319 --> 02:16:49.190 align:start position:0%
to come in
and

02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:16:50.790 --> 02:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
you know the boardroom was filled with
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
people and said
 
02:16:53.910 --> 02:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
no we we can't we shouldn't have a
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
tattoo parlor
 
02:16:58.389 --> 02:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
in town because it's not in a family
 
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
friendly you know in a family-friendly
 
02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:01.429 align:start position:0%
friendly you know in a family-friendly
environment

02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
environment
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm saying okay so like the
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
family-friendly environment like the bar
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
at this place and the bar at this place
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
and there's like four bars
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
around the oval in the center of town
 
02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
now in the end that person had a good
 
02:17:15.519 --> 02:17:16.549 align:start position:0%
now in the end that person had a good
record

02:17:16.549 --> 02:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
record
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
from where they were coming there was no
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
reason why you shouldn't let them in
 
02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
they came in they took the risk
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
a half a year later it didn't work out
 
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
for them
 
02:17:28.469 --> 02:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
and they left
 
02:17:31.030 --> 02:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
but that was totally their decision you
 
02:17:33.669 --> 02:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
know we gave them the opportunity
 
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
to come in to establish their business
 
02:17:38.309 --> 02:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
and and to try to grow it into something
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
successful so they can support
 
02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
themselves and their family and i think
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to do
 
02:17:47.669 --> 02:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
with this bill here is to create an
 
02:17:47.679 --> 02:17:48.950 align:start position:0%
with this bill here is to create an
opportunity

02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:17:48.960 --> 02:17:52.150 align:start position:0%
opportunity
and

02:17:52.150 --> 02:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
i can't i can't
 
02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:56.469 align:start position:0%
i can't i can't
base

02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
base
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
my opinion on whether just like the
 
02:18:01.750 --> 02:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
tattoo parlor i'm it was someplace that
 
02:18:03.669 --> 02:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
i would never visit
 
02:18:06.629 --> 02:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
i probably wouldn't even promote it
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
but if other place other people wanted
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
to go there and and
 
02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519 align:start position:0%
do do whatever then that that was their
 
02:18:15.519 --> 02:18:16.709 align:start position:0%
do do whatever then that that was their
business

02:18:16.709 --> 02:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:18:19.110 --> 02:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
just just as if there's something in a
 
02:18:19.120 --> 02:18:20.469 align:start position:0%
just just as if there's something in a
store

02:18:20.469 --> 02:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
store
 
02:18:20.479 --> 02:18:21.669 align:start position:0%
store
uh

02:18:21.669 --> 02:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
if somebody doesn't want to look at a
 
02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:25.190 align:start position:0%
if somebody doesn't want to look at a
screen

02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
screen
 
02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
they can let the manager know
 
02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
and again you know what drives business
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
up and up and down is whether
 
02:18:33.599 --> 02:18:34.549 align:start position:0%
up and up and down is whether
uh

02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
the policies
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
of the management
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
acceptable to the customers that walk
 
02:18:43.910 --> 02:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
through the door
 
02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
and if a business establishes something
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
and they start losing customers
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
chances are they're going to change it
 
02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:54.870 align:start position:0%
chances are they're going to change it
and

02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
you know i really hope that we could
 
02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
really look back at at our position that
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
our position is to create opportunities
 
02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
for business
 
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
and what we should be regulating is the
 
02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
discriminatory actions
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
that that they might have against their
 
02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
employees in terms of race sex
 
02:19:18.629 --> 02:19:18.639 align:start position:0%
whatever um but but not not that we
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be regulating the aesthetics
 
02:19:22.309 --> 02:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
of it well gary
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
senator guy uh
 
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
senator daniels
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
first off if we don't pass this bill
 
02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
now one of the businesses we're talking
 
02:19:32.309 --> 02:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
about is going to close not one not one
 
02:19:33.349 --> 02:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
this is going to be such an
 
02:19:33.359 --> 02:19:34.790 align:start position:0%
this is going to be such an
infinitesimal

02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
infinitesimal
 
02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
amount of additional revenue
 
02:19:39.509 --> 02:19:39.519 align:start position:0%
it's not going to make a matter it does
 
02:19:40.950 --> 02:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
again and all the big players aren't
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
going to go for this anyway
 
02:19:44.469 --> 02:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:19:44.479 --> 02:19:45.990 align:start position:0%
so i
i

02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
i you know and and keno alone isn't
 
02:19:51.349 --> 02:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
going to bring any business in
 
02:19:52.710 --> 02:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's not going to bring anybody who's
 
02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
going to come and just have keynote but
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
we're trying to avoid that actually
 
02:19:57.830 --> 02:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:19:57.840 --> 02:19:58.550 align:start position:0%
uh so
and

02:19:58.550 --> 02:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
and as we said yesterday there was some
 
02:20:03.830 --> 02:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
concern about lottery revenues
 
02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:04.710 align:start position:0%
concern about lottery revenues
but

02:20:04.710 --> 02:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to be just fine
 
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
with the lottery because of the because
 
02:20:09.750 --> 02:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
of the uh the gasoline prices and less
 
02:20:11.910 --> 02:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
people buying scratch tickets at the gas
 
02:20:11.920 --> 02:20:13.750 align:start position:0%
people buying scratch tickets at the gas
station

02:20:13.750 --> 02:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
station
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
but on the other hand because i chatted
 
02:20:16.710 --> 02:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
with the executive director after the
 
02:20:19.429 --> 02:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
meeting that on the other hand our
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
sports betting is doing great guns
 
02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:22.710 align:start position:0%
sports betting is doing great guns
uh

02:20:22.710 --> 02:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
not showing any slow down so we're way
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
ahead of budget
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
and yeah if if the gas prices continue
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
the way they are
 
02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
yeah we will probably come back to more
 
02:20:34.389 --> 02:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
normal range but but it's going to be
 
02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
made up by
 
02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:36.710 align:start position:0%
made up by
by

02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
by the uh
 
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
the sports betting revenues
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
so i hear all of you um
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
just just call me a thick italian
 
02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
mediterranean head here i knew you knew
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
would laugh at that
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
but uh but uh we're gonna hold our
 
02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:13.910 align:start position:0%
 
guys

02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:56.790 --> 02:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:59.750 --> 02:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
and a gaida

02:56:03.830 --> 02:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:06.309 --> 02:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
in the interest of preserving the bill
 
02:56:07.830 --> 02:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
the senate will accede to the house
 
02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:09.590 align:start position:0%
the senate will accede to the house
position

02:56:09.590 --> 02:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:56:12.550 --> 02:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
with the commentary that that you've yet
 
02:56:14.710 --> 02:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
to provide a principle upon which the
 
02:56:17.110 --> 02:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
decision to refuse a store owner to to
 
02:56:20.230 --> 02:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
show a screen in his or her store
 
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
and but we will exceed to the house
 
02:56:23.429 --> 02:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
position and we will revisit it come
 
02:56:25.190 --> 02:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
next year
 
02:56:26.870 --> 02:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:56:29.910 --> 02:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i think we are all set then
 
03:04:38.150 --> 03:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:41.510 --> 03:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open up the hearing on the
 
03:04:45.230 --> 03:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
committee conference on
 
03:04:45.240 --> 03:04:46.790 align:start position:0%
committee conference on
1256

03:04:46.790 --> 03:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
1256
 
03:04:48.469 --> 03:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
related to the positions within the
 
03:04:50.070 --> 03:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
department of military affairs and
 
03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
veterans services
 
03:04:53.830 --> 03:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
and one of the things i'm not happy as a
 
03:04:55.590 --> 03:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
chairman that two amendments were
 
03:04:55.600 --> 03:04:56.950 align:start position:0%
chairman that two amendments were
attached

03:04:56.950 --> 03:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
attached
 
03:04:59.429 --> 03:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
uh using veterans and i know it's not
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
you three right here it came from the
 
03:05:03.510 --> 03:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
finance you know because some every two
 
03:05:05.750 --> 03:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
years we'll use those political pawns
 
03:05:07.429 --> 03:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
our veterans bills
 
03:05:09.349 --> 03:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
you know they stick on amendments but
 
03:05:11.030 --> 03:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's life
 
03:05:13.830 --> 03:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh but anyways um i'd like to get some
 
03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
on the first amendment
 
03:05:17.990 --> 03:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh from the senate if you can ex
 
03:05:19.590 --> 03:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
somebody can explain that when on the
 
03:05:19.600 --> 03:05:20.710 align:start position:0%
somebody can explain that when on the
medicaid

03:05:20.710 --> 03:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
03:05:22.790 --> 03:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh costs
 
03:05:24.550 --> 03:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
the ambulances the ambulance medicaid
 
03:05:26.870 --> 03:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
costs i'd be uh happy to um chair
 
03:05:30.389 --> 03:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
balducero so in it's been let's say 17
 
03:05:32.630 --> 03:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
years since we have actually
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
seen an increase a reasonable increase
 
03:05:38.070 --> 03:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
in medicaid reimbursement rates for
 
03:05:39.830 --> 03:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
ambulance services and why we're asking
 
03:05:41.269 --> 03:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
for this
 
03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
now is that
 
03:05:45.429 --> 03:05:45.439 align:start position:0%
we have a not only a work we have a
 
03:05:47.990 --> 03:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
workforce crisis and ambulance services
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
are having difficulty not only you know
 
03:05:51.750 --> 03:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
staffing but with their operational
 
03:05:54.870 --> 03:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
costs without an edge this is one way
 
03:05:57.510 --> 03:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
that we can assist them in you know
 
03:05:59.910 --> 03:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
meeting you know basically continuing to
 
03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
operate and serving our communities so
 
03:06:05.590 --> 03:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's as as i said it's been a long time
 
03:06:07.590 --> 03:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
and i was approached
 
03:06:09.190 --> 03:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
at you know
 
03:06:10.950 --> 03:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
close to the 11th hour
 
03:06:12.790 --> 03:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
about making trying to get something
 
03:06:14.950 --> 03:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
done this year we have established a
 
03:06:14.960 --> 03:06:16.150 align:start position:0%
done this year we have established a
workforce

03:06:16.150 --> 03:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
03:06:18.309 --> 03:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
study not a study community we've we've
 
03:06:20.309 --> 03:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
started a workforce committee with
 
03:06:21.510 --> 03:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner quinn over at the
 
03:06:22.710 --> 03:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
department of safety and we're really
 
03:06:24.230 --> 03:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
working hard on recruitment retention
 
03:06:26.710 --> 03:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
issues and this was identified as a key
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
piece because we have limited sources of
 
03:06:31.349 --> 03:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
fine of funding for emergency medical
 
03:06:33.429 --> 03:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
service units so
 
03:06:36.150 --> 03:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
we decided to try to raise these rates
 
03:06:38.389 --> 03:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
because it hasn't happened in so long um
 
03:06:40.309 --> 03:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
this will
 
03:06:42.309 --> 03:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
especially in areas where there are
 
03:06:44.469 --> 03:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
there's a high medicaid payer mix this
 
03:06:46.389 --> 03:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
will make a significant difference so
 
03:06:48.870 --> 03:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
it's a step in the right direction and
 
03:06:50.150 --> 03:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's where this started
 
03:06:50.160 --> 03:06:54.790 align:start position:0%
that's that's where this started
representative

03:06:54.790 --> 03:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:57.269 --> 03:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair um
 
03:06:59.830 --> 03:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
would you please ask mr ribson to come
 
03:06:59.840 --> 03:07:01.110 align:start position:0%
would you please ask mr ribson to come
up

03:07:01.110 --> 03:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:07:03.030 --> 03:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
i think some of these questions may be
 
03:07:05.510 --> 03:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
for him lipman sorry
 
03:07:07.990 --> 03:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
i've got sununu on the mind
 
03:07:10.950 --> 03:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
and who was
 
03:07:14.950 --> 03:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
see i don't work with him that's why i
 
03:07:17.830 --> 03:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
03:07:19.750 --> 03:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
so mr littman has worked with us on this
 
03:07:22.070 --> 03:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
he's the director of medicaid okay now i
 
03:07:24.389 --> 03:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
know thank you welcome good afternoon
 
03:07:26.150 --> 03:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um henry lipman the medicaid
 
03:07:27.590 --> 03:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
director for the record
 
03:07:29.670 --> 03:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
um in addition to what the senator
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
apprentice has outlined is
 
03:07:35.030 --> 03:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioners received a number of
 
03:07:35.040 --> 03:07:36.230 align:start position:0%
the commissioners received a number of
letters

03:07:36.230 --> 03:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
letters
 
03:07:38.389 --> 03:07:38.399 align:start position:0%
emails from nursing homes that where
 
03:07:40.070 --> 03:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
ambulance companies
 
03:07:42.550 --> 03:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
based on the staffing crisis are not
 
03:07:45.269 --> 03:07:45.279 align:start position:0%
um able to service the nursing
 
03:07:47.110 --> 03:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
facilities which is resulting in delays
 
03:07:49.429 --> 03:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
and some transfers um
 
03:07:51.670 --> 03:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
and the concern is that
 
03:07:53.990 --> 03:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
that is likely to get worse before it
 
03:07:55.269 --> 03:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
gets better and
 
03:07:57.110 --> 03:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
um while this won't solve the problem
 
03:07:59.830 --> 03:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
completely it will i think contribute to
 
03:08:03.349 --> 03:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
to a start to um and would appreciate uh
 
03:08:04.469 --> 03:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
03:08:06.550 --> 03:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
the issue of things starting to
 
03:08:08.710 --> 03:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
unwind if you will for being able to
 
03:08:10.790 --> 03:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
provide services something that's a
 
03:08:13.110 --> 03:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
fairly recent phenomena it wasn't
 
03:08:15.110 --> 03:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily present um a number of
 
03:08:17.110 --> 03:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
months back but we're starting to see
 
03:08:20.710 --> 03:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:23.349 --> 03:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
some of you may have the
 
03:08:25.670 --> 03:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
nursing homes that are affiliated with
 
03:08:27.510 --> 03:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
the genesis in your communities and i
 
03:08:27.520 --> 03:08:28.790 align:start position:0%
the genesis in your communities and i
think

03:08:28.790 --> 03:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:08:30.950 --> 03:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
they're the largest provider and they've
 
03:08:32.550 --> 03:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
two of the large ambulance companies
 
03:08:34.870 --> 03:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
that service them have pulled out from
 
03:08:37.190 --> 03:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
providing regular transfers
 
03:08:39.269 --> 03:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
and that's i think why it's important to
 
03:08:40.710 --> 03:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
try to do something in this session if
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
we could thank you
 
03:08:43.040 --> 03:08:44.389 align:start position:0%
we could thank you
follow

03:08:44.389 --> 03:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
follow
 
03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh so mr lipman i i have maybe four
 
03:08:49.269 --> 03:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
really in the
 
03:08:55.910 --> 03:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:55.920 --> 03:08:57.190 align:start position:0%
 
scenario

03:08:57.190 --> 03:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
03:08:57.200 --> 03:08:59.910 align:start position:0%
scenario
um

03:08:59.910 --> 03:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:02.309 --> 03:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
it was stated that there hasn't been an
 
03:09:04.870 --> 03:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
increase in medicaid reimbursement rates
 
03:09:07.750 --> 03:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
for ambulance services for 17 years is
 
03:09:09.670 --> 03:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
that true
 
03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
the um two 3.1 percent increases did
 
03:09:13.920 --> 03:09:15.190 align:start position:0%
the um two 3.1 percent increases did
did

03:09:15.190 --> 03:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
did
 
03:09:17.670 --> 03:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
improve the rates of ambulances but i
 
03:09:19.910 --> 03:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
can share with you that there's
 
03:09:21.750 --> 03:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
compared to medicare for example their
 
03:09:22.630 --> 03:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
weight loss
 
03:09:25.269 --> 03:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
i want to just stay on yes
 
03:09:28.150 --> 03:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
what rates we had and when we had them
 
03:09:30.630 --> 03:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
so i i heard that we haven't had one in
 
03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
17 years you're saying we've had a
 
03:09:35.269 --> 03:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
couple in the 17 years could you just
 
03:09:37.990 --> 03:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
tell us the year and the amount
 
03:09:41.030 --> 03:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
in 20 and 21 january 20 and 21 there
 
03:09:43.269 --> 03:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
were two 3.1
 
03:09:45.429 --> 03:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
increases that were covered in the
 
03:09:48.389 --> 03:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
overall provider rate increase is my
 
03:09:48.399 --> 03:09:49.670 align:start position:0%
overall provider rate increase is my
recollection

03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
recollection
 
03:09:51.269 --> 03:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
03:09:55.030 --> 03:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
so follow go follow let him finish it um
 
03:09:58.229 --> 03:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
okay so so those raises i assume went
 
03:10:00.550 --> 03:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
through the governor's standard uh
 
03:10:02.150 --> 03:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
budget process
 
03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
and the governor determined uh that
 
03:10:07.110 --> 03:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
process determined that 3.1 percent was
 
03:10:09.349 --> 03:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
the right amount is is that correct
 
03:10:12.070 --> 03:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
no that wasn't across the board it
 
03:10:15.429 --> 03:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
provided to all um providers of of
 
03:10:15.439 --> 03:10:17.750 align:start position:0%
provided to all um providers of of
services

03:10:17.750 --> 03:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:10:20.229 --> 03:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
it was across the board that was in hb1
 
03:10:21.950 --> 03:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
hb 2 in
 
03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
2019 i think session to be implemented
 
03:10:32.150 --> 03:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay so the governor didn't put it into
 
03:10:37.110 --> 03:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
the budget it came in the back end
 
03:10:40.389 --> 03:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
during hb2 we real apparently somebody
 
03:10:42.870 --> 03:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
realized the rates were too low and a
 
03:10:45.510 --> 03:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
senator or a representative
 
03:10:47.750 --> 03:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
put the 3.1 percent in
 
03:10:49.750 --> 03:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm trying to understand the
 
03:10:52.830 --> 03:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
chronology of who did what and how
 
03:10:55.349 --> 03:10:55.359 align:start position:0%
much there hadn't been a rate increase
 
03:10:57.429 --> 03:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
for 17 years
 
03:10:57.439 --> 03:10:58.710 align:start position:0%
for 17 years
until

03:10:58.710 --> 03:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
until
 
03:11:01.670 --> 03:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature in 2019
 
03:11:01.680 --> 03:11:02.630 align:start position:0%
the legislature in 2019
session

03:11:02.630 --> 03:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
approved a 3.1 percent increase for all
 
03:11:08.389 --> 03:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
providers in medicaid
 
03:11:10.630 --> 03:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
service providers in medicaid
 
03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
to be implemented on january 1 of 20 and
 
03:11:16.710 --> 03:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
january 1 of 21 so there was nothing
 
03:11:19.110 --> 03:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
distinct for ambulance services it was
 
03:11:21.670 --> 03:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
across the board to all providers
 
03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:22.950 align:start position:0%
across the board to all providers
follow-up

03:11:22.950 --> 03:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:11:25.990 --> 03:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay so what i think you just told me is
 
03:11:28.150 --> 03:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
why i don't recall this in division
 
03:11:30.070 --> 03:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
three that this was not part of the
 
03:11:32.150 --> 03:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
governor's budget proposal increasing
 
03:11:33.590 --> 03:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
the rates for
 
03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
ambulance services specifically
 
03:11:38.070 --> 03:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
because i'm trying to remember why i
 
03:11:39.510 --> 03:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
don't remember this because i think it
 
03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
was in the session before you were yeah
 
03:11:44.070 --> 03:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
it was 19 sessions yeah yeah
 
03:11:46.950 --> 03:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
it was implemented in 20 and 21 but not
 
03:11:55.110 --> 03:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:57.910 --> 03:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
we had no clue on it we liked it i agree
 
03:12:00.070 --> 03:12:00.080 align:start position:0%
probably but we don't know so that's why
 
03:12:01.510 --> 03:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
we're glad you're here and well thank
 
03:12:03.830 --> 03:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
you as the chair of division three uh
 
03:12:06.550 --> 03:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
finance i i it's this is just sort of a
 
03:12:08.550 --> 03:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
common area feel free to keep going all
 
03:12:10.870 --> 03:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
right thank you sir um
 
03:12:13.830 --> 03:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:12:16.710 --> 03:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
this couldn't have been a crisis
 
03:12:19.750 --> 03:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
only in the last couple of years we we
 
03:12:21.510 --> 03:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
why do you think
 
03:12:24.229 --> 03:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a raise proposed in the
 
03:12:26.469 --> 03:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
normal order of business in the
 
03:12:26.479 --> 03:12:27.830 align:start position:0%
normal order of business in the
governor's

03:12:27.830 --> 03:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
03:12:27.840 --> 03:12:29.670 align:start position:0%
governor's
budget

03:12:29.670 --> 03:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
03:12:33.349 --> 03:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
coming out of the pandemic right or in
 
03:12:35.910 --> 03:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
the pandemic period
 
03:12:37.349 --> 03:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
03:12:37.359 --> 03:12:38.150 align:start position:0%
a number of
the

03:12:38.150 --> 03:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:12:39.990 --> 03:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
emt ems people
 
03:12:41.990 --> 03:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
migrated to other parts of the health
 
03:12:43.830 --> 03:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
care system whether it's working in
 
03:12:46.950 --> 03:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
hospital er departments um working in
 
03:12:49.429 --> 03:12:49.439 align:start position:0%
urgent cares doing other types of things
 
03:12:51.670 --> 03:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:12:54.229 --> 03:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
we had a meeting with the head of ems in
 
03:12:57.910 --> 03:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
terms of licensure in in the state
 
03:13:01.349 --> 03:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
that even though the workforce is not
 
03:13:03.830 --> 03:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
changed a lot it's not changed a lot the
 
03:13:06.550 --> 03:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
line a lot of uh ambulance ems providers
 
03:13:09.190 --> 03:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
leaving if you will the ambulances fire
 
03:13:09.200 --> 03:13:10.389 align:start position:0%
leaving if you will the ambulances fire
services

03:13:10.389 --> 03:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:13:13.510 --> 03:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
and it's really again only um
 
03:13:16.309 --> 03:13:16.319 align:start position:0%
since probably march april time frame
 
03:13:17.830 --> 03:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
that we
 
03:13:19.670 --> 03:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
are starting to really see
 
03:13:21.269 --> 03:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
where ambulance companies are
 
03:13:23.110 --> 03:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
withdrawing from providing chair car
 
03:13:25.590 --> 03:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
services from ambulance services to to
 
03:13:27.429 --> 03:13:27.439 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities and and if this is
 
03:13:29.349 --> 03:13:29.359 align:start position:0%
being seen in other states as well you
 
03:13:31.110 --> 03:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
know massachusetts has had the problem
 
03:13:33.830 --> 03:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
we were we had seen it after the budget
 
03:13:34.870 --> 03:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
was long
 
03:13:36.710 --> 03:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
pie us to start to see the problem
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
actually materializing in our region and
 
03:13:42.550 --> 03:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:45.110 --> 03:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you again uh mr chair all
 
03:13:46.630 --> 03:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
right so
 
03:13:46.640 --> 03:13:48.229 align:start position:0%
right so
um

03:13:48.229 --> 03:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:50.469 --> 03:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming governor's budget
 
03:13:50.479 --> 03:13:51.510 align:start position:0%
in the upcoming governor's budget
process

03:13:51.510 --> 03:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:13:54.309 --> 03:13:54.319 align:start position:0%
is there going to be a specific request
 
03:13:57.910 --> 03:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
for ambulance services increases
 
03:14:00.469 --> 03:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
i think that we would need to consider
 
03:14:02.870 --> 03:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
doing more than what's what's here if
 
03:14:02.880 --> 03:14:04.150 align:start position:0%
doing more than what's what's here if
the

03:14:04.150 --> 03:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:05.990 --> 03:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
the trends continue to go the way
 
03:14:08.950 --> 03:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
they're going um i think we're in a
 
03:14:11.590 --> 03:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
beginning crisis phase i think
 
03:14:11.600 --> 03:14:12.950 align:start position:0%
beginning crisis phase i think
oh

03:14:12.950 --> 03:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:14:16.229 --> 03:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
i turned that off i i really did
 
03:14:18.790 --> 03:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
my smartphone has outsmarted me again
 
03:14:21.030 --> 03:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think that we will need to do
 
03:14:22.870 --> 03:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
more than here but i think it's
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
important to do something now i mean
 
03:14:28.229 --> 03:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
what's proposed here amounts to a
 
03:14:28.239 --> 03:14:29.510 align:start position:0%
what's proposed here amounts to a
15

03:14:29.510 --> 03:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
15
 
03:14:33.110 --> 03:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
increase in the current medicaid
 
03:14:35.030 --> 03:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
fee schedule for ambulances but we're
 
03:14:38.550 --> 03:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
still well below even half of medicare
 
03:14:40.790 --> 03:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
i can't imagine anything being half of
 
03:14:42.710 --> 03:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
medicare um that's that's why we're
 
03:14:45.110 --> 03:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
having the problem so so in closing mr
 
03:14:47.590 --> 03:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
chair i i would say
 
03:14:51.110 --> 03:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
that division iii fully funded every one
 
03:14:53.269 --> 03:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
of the governor's direct care budget
 
03:14:55.349 --> 03:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
line items this past
 
03:14:57.990 --> 03:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
budget cycle and had this been put in
 
03:15:01.030 --> 03:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
the budget it would have been funded and
 
03:15:04.070 --> 03:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
so now we're showing up it's a crisis i
 
03:15:07.510 --> 03:15:07.520 align:start position:0%
don't like crisis so if we could just
 
03:15:10.150 --> 03:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
figure out why we failed to plan
 
03:15:12.550 --> 03:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
because that turns out to be a plan for
 
03:15:15.670 --> 03:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
failure so if we could figure out how to
 
03:15:18.309 --> 03:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
do it right in the next budget cycle and
 
03:15:20.469 --> 03:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
continue to do it right i i would
 
03:15:22.070 --> 03:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
03:15:24.550 --> 03:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
well certainly we'll we'll do a a better
 
03:15:27.349 --> 03:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
job i think what was not apparent to us
 
03:15:27.359 --> 03:15:28.229 align:start position:0%
job i think what was not apparent to us
is

03:15:28.229 --> 03:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:15:31.349 --> 03:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
what would happen in the period of
 
03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
during 20 and 21 let's say in terms of
 
03:15:35.030 --> 03:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
what's happened to the health care labor
 
03:15:37.830 --> 03:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
market and you know we the department
 
03:15:39.429 --> 03:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
prepared its budget
 
03:15:41.110 --> 03:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
you know at a time when it looked like
 
03:15:44.950 --> 03:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
all this was over and and certainly um
 
03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
it's over in many respects but in terms
 
03:15:49.349 --> 03:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
of the healthcare workforce it's not
 
03:15:52.550 --> 03:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
um so so so yes sir i will admit that
 
03:15:55.110 --> 03:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
your pro your your job is a lot harder
 
03:15:56.950 --> 03:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
than mine because it's just a lot easier
 
03:15:59.750 --> 03:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
to throw dirt clods from here but but i
 
03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
i i if we are less and i'm
 
03:16:10.950 --> 03:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:13.190 --> 03:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
be able to do this the right way in the
 
03:16:15.429 --> 03:16:15.439 align:start position:0%
future so that our health care system
 
03:16:18.950 --> 03:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
can plan and stabilize and and take care
 
03:16:20.790 --> 03:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
of our citizens
 
03:16:23.190 --> 03:16:23.200 align:start position:0%
you you probably recall if i could add
 
03:16:25.030 --> 03:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
just my comments if that's okay mr
 
03:16:26.790 --> 03:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
chairman um just that
 
03:16:29.910 --> 03:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
when we began um looking at financial
 
03:16:31.429 --> 03:16:31.439 align:start position:0%
items at one point it looked like the
 
03:16:33.590 --> 03:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
state was gonna be like a 300 million
 
03:16:36.229 --> 03:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
dollar 500 million dollar deficit so in
 
03:16:38.309 --> 03:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to put more money
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
in the in the budget you know that
 
03:16:42.870 --> 03:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
what was not known was how much federal
 
03:16:46.229 --> 03:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
money was going to come in thereafter
 
03:16:48.630 --> 03:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
that being said i take your comments to
 
03:16:49.910 --> 03:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
heart and
 
03:16:51.910 --> 03:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
we will try to do a better job in the
 
03:16:53.590 --> 03:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
upcoming budget
 
03:16:55.830 --> 03:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay before i go to senate parents mass
 
03:16:58.710 --> 03:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
miller and then senator hennessey
 
03:17:01.229 --> 03:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
one question that pops in my mind
 
03:17:04.229 --> 03:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
868 0264
 
03:17:06.630 --> 03:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
does this keep make us compatible with
 
03:17:09.510 --> 03:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
like other states or are we still below
 
03:17:11.670 --> 03:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
the totem pole here i think we're we're
 
03:17:13.910 --> 03:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
well below the the totem pole for you
 
03:17:16.389 --> 03:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
know ambulance ambulances unfortunately
 
03:17:17.590 --> 03:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
have not
 
03:17:20.710 --> 03:17:20.720 align:start position:0%
received a lot of attention over the
 
03:17:20.720 --> 03:17:21.510 align:start position:0%
received a lot of attention over the
over

03:17:21.510 --> 03:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
over
 
03:17:24.309 --> 03:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
better than a decade um
 
03:17:26.389 --> 03:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
you know just to give you um we had done
 
03:17:28.710 --> 03:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
some calculations to to bring us up to
 
03:17:32.229 --> 03:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
50 of medicare would have been um
 
03:17:35.349 --> 03:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
a 2.3 million dollar number to bring us
 
03:17:35.359 --> 03:17:37.750 align:start position:0%
a 2.3 million dollar number to bring us
um

03:17:37.750 --> 03:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:39.670 --> 03:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
up to uh
 
03:17:39.680 --> 03:17:40.870 align:start position:0%
up to uh
the

03:17:40.870 --> 03:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:17:42.389 --> 03:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
the average rate for the new england
 
03:17:43.750 --> 03:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
states would have been a four million
 
03:17:45.269 --> 03:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
dollar number just to give you some
 
03:17:47.429 --> 03:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
perspective on he might be answering the
 
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you uh senator
 
03:17:49.840 --> 03:17:52.469 align:start position:0%
question okay thank you uh senator
apprentice

03:17:52.469 --> 03:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:54.630 --> 03:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman balducero
 
03:17:54.640 --> 03:17:55.590 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman balducero
and

03:17:55.590 --> 03:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:17:57.269 --> 03:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
03:17:59.030 --> 03:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative edwards questions in
 
03:18:00.790 --> 03:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
terms of the chronology covered some of
 
03:18:02.150 --> 03:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
the points that i was i was going to
 
03:18:04.790 --> 03:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
help but director lipman has handled
 
03:18:07.830 --> 03:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
that for me um i did
 
03:18:09.510 --> 03:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
if i may take this moment to respond to
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
your last question about what's
 
03:18:12.550 --> 03:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
happening around us in other states is
 
03:18:13.830 --> 03:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
that appropriate or do you want to wait
 
03:18:15.110 --> 03:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
no that's appropriate because i'm
 
03:18:16.229 --> 03:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
wondering i don't know if we have the
 
03:18:18.950 --> 03:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
power to if i had the power i'd raise it
 
03:18:20.710 --> 03:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't know if i do it but you
 
03:18:22.469 --> 03:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
know i mean if we're sticking it to our
 
03:18:24.070 --> 03:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
ambulance drivers
 
03:18:25.670 --> 03:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
then we should be taking care of them
 
03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
right do it think
 
03:18:27.120 --> 03:18:28.229 align:start position:0%
right do it think
but

03:18:28.229 --> 03:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:18:31.190 --> 03:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh so maine reimburses
 
03:18:33.429 --> 03:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
at base rates of a hundred percent of
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
medicare vermont
 
03:18:36.870 --> 03:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
reimburses and this is
 
03:18:39.990 --> 03:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
at base rates at 74 of medicare
 
03:18:42.950 --> 03:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
connecticut reimburses at 72
 
03:18:45.990 --> 03:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts at 62 percent
 
03:18:48.550 --> 03:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
and just if i may director lipman and we
 
03:18:50.710 --> 03:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
are at i'm
 
03:18:52.309 --> 03:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
we're we're the lowest we're we're the
 
03:18:54.790 --> 03:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
lowest yeah 38 percent
 
03:18:59.269 --> 03:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:01.670 --> 03:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're still below 50 to get it up to 50
 
03:19:02.950 --> 03:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
would require
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
both state and federal funds of 2.3
 
03:19:05.040 --> 03:19:06.790 align:start position:0%
both state and federal funds of 2.3
million

03:19:06.790 --> 03:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:19:09.670 --> 03:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
this proposal at 15 percent
 
03:19:13.429 --> 03:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh at 887 000 which is in here is
 
03:19:13.439 --> 03:19:15.750 align:start position:0%
uh at 887 000 which is in here is
342

03:19:15.750 --> 03:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
342
 
03:19:17.670 --> 03:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
000 is the state share
 
03:19:21.429 --> 03:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
the federal share is five almost 545.
 
03:19:23.510 --> 03:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
i think that as i understood from
 
03:19:25.590 --> 03:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
leadership standpoint that
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
as you had suggested we need to do more
 
03:19:29.110 --> 03:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
work in this area and i think
 
03:19:31.269 --> 03:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
in part i think this is a step to get to
 
03:19:33.830 --> 03:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
the next step
 
03:19:35.670 --> 03:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative hennessey i mean i'm
 
03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
sorry senator anderson thank you um
 
03:19:41.349 --> 03:19:41.359 align:start position:0%
question for um director lipman then so
 
03:19:44.150 --> 03:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
my understanding when i was on senate
 
03:19:46.950 --> 03:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
finance when we added these funds that
 
03:19:50.150 --> 03:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
these funds 868
 
03:19:50.160 --> 03:19:52.150 align:start position:0%
these funds 868
000

03:19:52.150 --> 03:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
000
 
03:19:54.150 --> 03:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
which i believe are all general funds
 
03:19:57.349 --> 03:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
right 868 000 no the the the number
 
03:19:58.710 --> 03:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
there is there's a state share in a
 
03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
federal share so is it 50 50. it's a
 
03:20:03.269 --> 03:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
little bit better than 50 50. it's uh
 
03:20:04.950 --> 03:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
probably closer to
 
03:20:07.750 --> 03:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
56 or 58 federal
 
03:20:09.349 --> 03:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
so my understanding then that would
 
03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
bring us from 38 to 50 is that not
 
03:20:14.070 --> 03:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
correct um
 
03:20:17.110 --> 03:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
that's not correct to get us to 50 the
 
03:20:18.630 --> 03:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
calculation was
 
03:20:18.640 --> 03:20:19.510 align:start position:0%
calculation was
um

03:20:19.510 --> 03:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:23.110 --> 03:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
it would take 927 000 in
 
03:20:25.349 --> 03:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
in general funds and almost a million
 
03:20:28.229 --> 03:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
for in federal funds to get us to 50 of
 
03:20:28.239 --> 03:20:32.790 align:start position:0%
for in federal funds to get us to 50 of
medicare

03:20:32.790 --> 03:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:35.990 --> 03:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
so what is what is what does uh 868 and
 
03:20:38.469 --> 03:20:38.479 align:start position:0%
combined funds get us now
 
03:20:38.479 --> 03:20:39.510 align:start position:0%
combined funds get us now
um

03:20:39.510 --> 03:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:41.349 --> 03:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
i don't have that calculated off the top
 
03:20:43.990 --> 03:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
of my head i i do know that what it
 
03:20:45.830 --> 03:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
amounts to is 15 percent over what we're
 
03:20:48.309 --> 03:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
paying today which probably is probably
 
03:20:50.070 --> 03:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
pretty close to the
 
03:20:52.710 --> 03:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
30 mid to upper 30s that you had
 
03:20:52.720 --> 03:20:57.110 align:start position:0%
30 mid to upper 30s that you had
suggested

03:20:57.110 --> 03:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:59.349 --> 03:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
but you
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:05.349 --> 03:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
i know senator sharon carson told me
 
03:21:07.110 --> 03:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
they taught me years ago make sure you
 
03:21:09.110 --> 03:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
take care of our employees so
 
03:21:10.710 --> 03:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
i got to make sure i don't screw up on
 
03:21:14.229 --> 03:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:14.239 --> 03:21:18.710 align:start position:0%
 
director

03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:20.229 --> 03:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
okay wait a minute i'm still are you
 
03:21:22.150 --> 03:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
done santa hennessy
 
03:21:24.070 --> 03:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just confused i thought we
 
03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
brought the rates up to from 38 to 50.
 
03:21:29.750 --> 03:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
do we have the power to do that on uh
 
03:21:33.429 --> 03:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
in a uh committee conference i'm if i'm
 
03:21:33.439 --> 03:21:35.429 align:start position:0%
in a uh committee conference i'm if i'm
sorry

03:21:35.429 --> 03:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:21:39.590 --> 03:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
if the 868 is a um
 
03:21:41.750 --> 03:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
is the general fund portion then yes you
 
03:21:48.309 --> 03:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:49.910 --> 03:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
i thought the 868 was a total
 
03:21:49.920 --> 03:21:59.269 align:start position:0%
i thought the 868 was a total
appropriation

03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:01.349 --> 03:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
i have to shout mr chairman if i may if
 
03:22:03.429 --> 03:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
you get the side by side
 
03:22:07.030 --> 03:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
it does say under section 8 on the last
 
03:22:08.710 --> 03:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
on page 7
 
03:22:08.720 --> 03:22:09.670 align:start position:0%
on page 7
that

03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:22:11.429 --> 03:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
03:22:13.190 --> 03:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
services shall increase the medicaid
 
03:22:14.790 --> 03:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate for ambulance
 
03:22:18.070 --> 03:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
services to be equal to 50
 
03:22:20.150 --> 03:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
of the medicare rate i didn't see that
 
03:22:22.469 --> 03:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
language i apologize so that's 868 would
 
03:22:24.550 --> 03:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
be correct to bring it up this funding
 
03:22:26.309 --> 03:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
will bring it up and i think
 
03:22:28.950 --> 03:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
um and also regards to representative
 
03:22:30.950 --> 03:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
edwards comments that
 
03:22:33.750 --> 03:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
um this will he will bring this forward
 
03:22:36.550 --> 03:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
during the next budget cycle and this is
 
03:22:38.550 --> 03:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
something that we do need to continue to
 
03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
work on
 
03:22:43.110 --> 03:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
so i i think that um this is in my
 
03:22:45.670 --> 03:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
opinion anyway it's entirely appropriate
 
03:22:46.790 --> 03:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
we do need
 
03:22:51.030 --> 03:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
at least 50 percent we can't um add that
 
03:22:52.630 --> 03:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
03:22:55.110 --> 03:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
for folks for out-of-pocket expenses
 
03:22:57.670 --> 03:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's extremely expensive and the more
 
03:22:58.790 --> 03:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
money that
 
03:23:00.550 --> 03:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
the state can pay
 
03:23:03.030 --> 03:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
to help people so they're not struggling
 
03:23:05.429 --> 03:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
with out-of-pocket medical expenses i
 
03:23:07.990 --> 03:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
think is entirely appropriate
 
03:23:10.389 --> 03:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
03:23:13.269 --> 03:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative
 
03:23:13.279 --> 03:23:14.070 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative
um

03:23:14.070 --> 03:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
is this an
 
03:23:17.750 --> 03:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing issue that will have to be
 
03:23:21.269 --> 03:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
addressed annually or will that 50
 
03:23:23.349 --> 03:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
stay across the board for an uncertain
 
03:23:25.830 --> 03:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
amount of time i think that is sort of a
 
03:23:28.150 --> 03:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
point in time measurement um
 
03:23:31.030 --> 03:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
you know typically medicare is going up
 
03:23:34.150 --> 03:23:34.160 align:start position:0%
in the low single digits uh you know you
 
03:23:36.229 --> 03:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
see typical rate increases two or three
 
03:23:36.239 --> 03:23:37.190 align:start position:0%
see typical rate increases two or three
percent

03:23:37.190 --> 03:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:23:37.200 --> 03:23:38.150 align:start position:0%
percent
um

03:23:38.150 --> 03:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:39.590 --> 03:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes a little bit more than three
 
03:23:40.950 --> 03:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
percent but you don't typically see
 
03:23:42.309 --> 03:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
medicare going up
 
03:23:44.550 --> 03:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
from a provider standpoint in jumps of
 
03:23:44.560 --> 03:23:45.429 align:start position:0%
from a provider standpoint in jumps of
like

03:23:45.429 --> 03:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:23:49.429 --> 03:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh rather than beat this
 
03:23:54.790 --> 03:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
anymore to get a consensus here we uh we
 
03:23:58.790 --> 03:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
one more go ahead uh thank you mr chair
 
03:24:01.670 --> 03:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
so i assume that the that this is still
 
03:24:03.750 --> 03:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
under the f map percentages and we're
 
03:24:05.429 --> 03:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit more federal money
 
03:24:08.389 --> 03:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
for our dollar these days yes and then
 
03:24:12.469 --> 03:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh given that's the case
 
03:24:15.269 --> 03:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
if we were to increase the general funds
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
portion of this
 
03:24:19.349 --> 03:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
are we confident that the feds would
 
03:24:22.469 --> 03:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
have the money to continue the fmap
 
03:24:22.479 --> 03:24:23.910 align:start position:0%
have the money to continue the fmap
match

03:24:23.910 --> 03:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
match
 
03:24:23.920 --> 03:24:24.870 align:start position:0%
match
yes

03:24:24.870 --> 03:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:24:26.469 --> 03:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
okay so if we threw another hundred
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
thousand and the feds would come back
 
03:24:30.630 --> 03:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
with another 120 or whatever the math is
 
03:24:30.640 --> 03:24:31.750 align:start position:0%
with another 120 or whatever the math is
yes

03:24:31.750 --> 03:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:24:32.630 --> 03:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:24:35.269 --> 03:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
so so based on that uh if we could have
 
03:24:37.670 --> 03:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
a discussion i i i'd be open to
 
03:24:40.309 --> 03:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
increasing the amount a little bit but
 
03:24:43.510 --> 03:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's just me what's the uh census here
 
03:24:44.950 --> 03:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
on increasing
 
03:24:46.870 --> 03:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
i think the senate would be very happy
 
03:24:49.670 --> 03:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
if the house agreed with
 
03:24:52.710 --> 03:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
the eight hundred and six
 
03:24:55.590 --> 03:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
sixty 68 000 of general funds that we've
 
03:24:58.150 --> 03:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
allocated to increase the rates and that
 
03:25:01.030 --> 03:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
to look at it again next year no more
 
03:25:01.040 --> 03:25:01.910 align:start position:0%
to look at it again next year no more
um

03:25:01.910 --> 03:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:03.830 --> 03:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
i just don't know where we're at right
 
03:25:06.150 --> 03:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
now money-wise so
 
03:25:07.590 --> 03:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
well i know i met with the speaker
 
03:25:09.830 --> 03:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
earlier he was talking about uh revenue
 
03:25:11.990 --> 03:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
project uh 400 million
 
03:25:14.550 --> 03:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh but i i kind of agree with you i want
 
03:25:15.990 --> 03:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
to raise it but
 
03:25:18.550 --> 03:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not a finance person and i think
 
03:25:21.590 --> 03:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
we have maybe six months left to go to
 
03:25:23.990 --> 03:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
the next budget cycle so i would think
 
03:25:25.830 --> 03:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
here this would cover us
 
03:25:28.150 --> 03:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
until then and then the new budget to go
 
03:25:29.590 --> 03:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
ahead like you said
 
03:25:31.670 --> 03:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
and go at it i kind of agree with you
 
03:25:31.680 --> 03:25:34.309 align:start position:0%
and go at it i kind of agree with you
there

03:25:34.309 --> 03:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:37.750 --> 03:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
anyone else yes chairman balducero and
 
03:25:41.269 --> 03:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
members of this this the plan
 
03:25:42.469 --> 03:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
was to
 
03:25:45.030 --> 03:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
make this increase now
 
03:25:46.229 --> 03:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
and to
 
03:25:48.309 --> 03:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
start working immediately on what we
 
03:25:50.389 --> 03:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
should be doing for more sustainable
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
pathway and coming back and working on
 
03:25:54.150 --> 03:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
the but putting this into the budget
 
03:25:57.030 --> 03:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
next year so that is we're making this
 
03:25:59.349 --> 03:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
ask now knowing that we have more work
 
03:26:00.469 --> 03:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:26:03.269 --> 03:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
and so i just wanted to share that okay
 
03:26:05.269 --> 03:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:26:06.870 --> 03:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
so do you want to make a motion i mean
 
03:26:09.269 --> 03:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
uh no no i'm still in the discussion
 
03:26:11.590 --> 03:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
mode if that's okay i i the the the
 
03:26:14.710 --> 03:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
reason i'd be open to increasing it some
 
03:26:16.469 --> 03:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
is because we're
 
03:26:18.870 --> 03:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
under the f map matching
 
03:26:21.429 --> 03:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
and that that f map matching is going to
 
03:26:23.990 --> 03:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
go away at some point and
 
03:26:26.389 --> 03:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
i i just assume if it were there for a
 
03:26:29.190 --> 03:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
little while to take maximal advantage
 
03:26:31.590 --> 03:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
of it uh
 
03:26:33.830 --> 03:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
our money's worth more under fmap than
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
it will be when fmap goes away so it
 
03:26:38.870 --> 03:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
just seems like it might be timely could
 
03:26:40.870 --> 03:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
you could you tell us mr littman when
 
03:26:44.150 --> 03:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
fmap is projected to go away the extra
 
03:26:44.160 --> 03:26:45.510 align:start position:0%
fmap is projected to go away the extra
matching

03:26:45.510 --> 03:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
matching
 
03:26:47.910 --> 03:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
so um i think that we'll have it at
 
03:26:51.190 --> 03:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
least till the quarter ending september
 
03:26:52.710 --> 03:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
03:26:55.030 --> 03:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
potentially uh based on the news
 
03:26:57.110 --> 03:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
yesterday that there's
 
03:26:59.590 --> 03:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
expectation it may be extended one more
 
03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
time it could be to the
 
03:27:04.630 --> 03:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
end of this uh calendar year i think for
 
03:27:05.990 --> 03:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
certain you could count on through
 
03:27:09.190 --> 03:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
september um and potentially until the
 
03:27:13.269 --> 03:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:15.349 --> 03:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:27:17.830 --> 03:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with the senate position i just
 
03:27:19.670 --> 03:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with making hay while the
 
03:27:19.680 --> 03:27:21.030 align:start position:0%
i'm okay with making hay while the
sunshine

03:27:21.030 --> 03:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
sunshine
 
03:27:24.950 --> 03:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:26.950 --> 03:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
yes we would appreciate you
 
03:27:29.429 --> 03:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
okay then uh i'm gonna put this aside we
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
all in census we agree with this here
 
03:27:32.870 --> 03:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
amendment okay then we're done with that
 
03:27:35.110 --> 03:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
one uh let's move on to the next one
 
03:27:35.120 --> 03:27:36.150 align:start position:0%

and i know you have a lot more history
 
03:28:29.349 --> 03:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
on on this so could you tell us the
 
03:28:31.429 --> 03:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
importance of the million dollars sure
 
03:28:33.990 --> 03:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:36.150 --> 03:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
some of us were around
 
03:28:39.030 --> 03:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
when arby came to us
 
03:28:41.110 --> 03:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
and presented a proposal to the
 
03:28:44.070 --> 03:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
legislature with regard to a a project
 
03:28:47.269 --> 03:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
that they were developing in manchester
 
03:28:49.190 --> 03:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
the united states department of defense
 
03:28:53.429 --> 03:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
granted army an 80 billion dollar grant
 
03:28:56.550 --> 03:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
to get into the regeneration process
 
03:28:57.910 --> 03:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
where they would do
 
03:28:57.920 --> 03:29:00.389 align:start position:0%
where they would do
[Music]

03:29:00.389 --> 03:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:29:02.950 --> 03:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh practice let's call it exotic
 
03:29:06.790 --> 03:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
medicine the creation of of organs
 
03:29:09.030 --> 03:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
and the creation of organs
 
03:29:11.429 --> 03:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
would play a very significant role in
 
03:29:14.070 --> 03:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
how we treat our troops coming back
 
03:29:15.269 --> 03:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh from
 
03:29:17.910 --> 03:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
from a war to an area or something of
 
03:29:19.670 --> 03:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
that nature and it was a part it's
 
03:29:23.349 --> 03:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
really a parts replacement situation
 
03:29:24.950 --> 03:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
and dean cayman
 
03:29:27.830 --> 03:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
has been uh
 
03:29:29.590 --> 03:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
well loaded throughout the world really
 
03:29:31.429 --> 03:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
for some of his inventions he invented
 
03:29:33.110 --> 03:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
the insulin pump he invented the
 
03:29:35.190 --> 03:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
wheelchair he invented the the
 
03:29:37.429 --> 03:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
wheelchair that climbed stairs
 
03:29:37.439 --> 03:29:38.309 align:start position:0%
wheelchair that climbed stairs
and

03:29:38.309 --> 03:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:40.950 --> 03:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
he uh invented the segway
 
03:29:43.670 --> 03:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
but very very intense
 
03:29:43.680 --> 03:29:45.670 align:start position:0%
but very very intense
research

03:29:45.670 --> 03:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
research
 
03:29:45.680 --> 03:29:46.389 align:start position:0%
research
in

03:29:46.389 --> 03:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:29:48.630 --> 03:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
very cutting edge
 
03:29:51.190 --> 03:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
cutting-edge research and the creation
 
03:29:54.710 --> 03:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
of organs the creation of body parts
 
03:29:57.670 --> 03:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
i mean do you know what that would do uh
 
03:30:00.229 --> 03:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
to the world that we live in today
 
03:30:03.269 --> 03:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
the the lives that would be saved
 
03:30:05.349 --> 03:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
so he uh came and came to the
 
03:30:07.750 --> 03:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
legislature and i think most of the
 
03:30:10.550 --> 03:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
house and senate approval
 
03:30:11.830 --> 03:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
we gave
 
03:30:14.710 --> 03:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
to to the army
 
03:30:17.910 --> 03:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
a tax situation where we negated
 
03:30:19.429 --> 03:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
their business profits and their
 
03:30:22.550 --> 03:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
business enterprise tax for 10 years
 
03:30:24.710 --> 03:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
in association with that
 
03:30:27.190 --> 03:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
a fund the governor agreed to this a
 
03:30:28.870 --> 03:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
fund was going to be set aside it would
 
03:30:31.030 --> 03:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
be it would max out at five million
 
03:30:31.040 --> 03:30:32.309 align:start position:0%
be it would max out at five million
dollars

03:30:32.309 --> 03:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:30:35.990 --> 03:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
that money to be used to redeem loads
 
03:30:38.550 --> 03:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
of people that were we were bringing in
 
03:30:41.110 --> 03:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
to do this extensive research
 
03:30:42.710 --> 03:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
because it does take
 
03:30:44.950 --> 03:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
a credentialed individual to perform
 
03:30:46.150 --> 03:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
this research
 
03:30:48.870 --> 03:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
now the caveat was this
 
03:30:51.830 --> 03:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
if a person got loan forgiveness
 
03:30:54.070 --> 03:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
they would they would have to work five
 
03:30:56.389 --> 03:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
years with the program
 
03:30:59.190 --> 03:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
in order to get loan forgiveness
 
03:31:02.710 --> 03:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
the the loans the money would be given
 
03:31:04.469 --> 03:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh to uh
 
03:31:05.750 --> 03:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
let's call it the
 
03:31:07.830 --> 03:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
the old
 
03:31:09.670 --> 03:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
research and development i'm trying to
 
03:31:11.830 --> 03:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
think of the old name of the program but
 
03:31:13.510 --> 03:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's now run by
 
03:31:15.590 --> 03:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh state
 
03:31:18.150 --> 03:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
the state they would manage the granting
 
03:31:19.830 --> 03:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
of these loans
 
03:31:21.750 --> 03:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
the loan forgiveness aspect and make
 
03:31:23.429 --> 03:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
sure that everything was was cut and
 
03:31:26.309 --> 03:31:26.319 align:start position:0%
drive the governor was uh very uh very
 
03:31:28.070 --> 03:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
up for doing this
 
03:31:30.070 --> 03:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
and it was a five five billion would be
 
03:31:32.870 --> 03:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
set aside over a period of time
 
03:31:32.880 --> 03:31:34.070 align:start position:0%
set aside over a period of time
and

03:31:34.070 --> 03:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:31:36.469 --> 03:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
uh that that was going to be a general
 
03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
fund of appropriation that's how all of
 
03:31:41.510 --> 03:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
this started and that was the genesis i
 
03:31:44.389 --> 03:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
think of of the the five uh the the one
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
million that they came to the uh to the
 
03:31:48.790 --> 03:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
senate and asked for and i think uh
 
03:31:51.110 --> 03:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
senator geider was the the person who
 
03:31:53.030 --> 03:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
sponsored that piece of piece of
 
03:31:53.040 --> 03:31:54.469 align:start position:0%
sponsored that piece of piece of
legislation

03:31:54.469 --> 03:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:31:54.479 --> 03:31:56.630 align:start position:0%
legislation
now

03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:31:58.870 --> 03:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
in looking this is this is in essence
 
03:32:00.550 --> 03:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
part of workforce development to be
 
03:32:02.070 --> 03:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
honest with you
 
03:32:04.469 --> 03:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
but you you needed this
 
03:32:07.990 --> 03:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh from their standpoint you needed this
 
03:32:09.510 --> 03:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
this item
 
03:32:12.229 --> 03:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
this loan forgiveness aspect of it to
 
03:32:15.030 --> 03:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
draw in these very highly qualified
 
03:32:17.590 --> 03:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
individuals who would be performing the
 
03:32:17.600 --> 03:32:18.790 align:start position:0%
individuals who would be performing the
research

03:32:18.790 --> 03:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
research
 
03:32:21.910 --> 03:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
now i've visited arby and i i encourage
 
03:32:23.670 --> 03:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
every one of you to visit
 
03:32:26.950 --> 03:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh dean cayman's decca
 
03:32:30.150 --> 03:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
outfit in manchester an army is in
 
03:32:32.229 --> 03:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
an old and older building that was at
 
03:32:34.309 --> 03:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
one time owned by the university and
 
03:32:37.030 --> 03:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
these research projects are taking place
 
03:32:37.040 --> 03:32:37.750 align:start position:0%
these research projects are taking place
and

03:32:37.750 --> 03:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:32:40.469 --> 03:32:40.479 align:start position:0%
the initial the initial research is
 
03:32:42.870 --> 03:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
heart regeneration and it's amazing to
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
me some of the things that have gone on
 
03:32:48.309 --> 03:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
and uh that that uh senator hennessy is
 
03:32:51.110 --> 03:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
sort of the genesis of of the program
 
03:32:53.750 --> 03:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
the idea of of the money and it was a
 
03:32:55.990 --> 03:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
five million dollars was gonna was going
 
03:32:58.150 --> 03:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
to be the number and the governor was
 
03:32:59.190 --> 03:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
going to uh
 
03:33:00.710 --> 03:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh appropriate that was going to come
 
03:33:02.229 --> 03:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
out of the governor's fund and he was
 
03:33:03.429 --> 03:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
going to ask the legislature to
 
03:33:05.429 --> 03:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate that money it was a 5
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
million max it would be managed
 
03:33:13.910 --> 03:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
by state aid by the state agency and
 
03:33:16.229 --> 03:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
the caveat was they would remain in the
 
03:33:20.790 --> 03:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:23.030 --> 03:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay if if i may add here i could
 
03:33:24.870 --> 03:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
probably clarify with just exactly what
 
03:33:26.150 --> 03:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
you're saying here
 
03:33:28.710 --> 03:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
i had lunch with senator bob geider uh
 
03:33:31.030 --> 03:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
this morning i met with the speaker and
 
03:33:33.510 --> 03:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
we pulled the law on this here my
 
03:33:35.590 --> 03:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
understanding is and why i was against
 
03:33:38.070 --> 03:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
this here as a chair when putting it on
 
03:33:40.630 --> 03:33:40.640 align:start position:0%
a veterans bill was because there was no
 
03:33:43.429 --> 03:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
hearing but apparently i was wrong told
 
03:33:45.349 --> 03:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
wrong on that because my understanding
 
03:33:47.990 --> 03:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
is the original bill for this here was
 
03:33:49.990 --> 03:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
stuck in on a labor bill
 
03:33:51.510 --> 03:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
went to labor
 
03:33:53.750 --> 03:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
the speaker decided it was non-germane
 
03:33:55.349 --> 03:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
it had a hearing
 
03:33:56.389 --> 03:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
it was
 
03:33:59.349 --> 03:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
kicked out of the house here because of
 
03:33:59.359 --> 03:34:00.870 align:start position:0%
kicked out of the house here because of
non-germaine

03:34:00.870 --> 03:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
non-germaine
 
03:34:03.190 --> 03:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
went back the senate put it on this here
 
03:34:03.200 --> 03:34:03.990 align:start position:0%
went back the senate put it on this here
now

03:34:03.990 --> 03:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:34:04.000 --> 03:34:06.469 align:start position:0%
now
the

03:34:06.469 --> 03:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:10.389 --> 03:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
in the bill it has rsa 162-t
 
03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
colon 3.
 
03:34:14.070 --> 03:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
what that meant to me in the speaker and
 
03:34:15.510 --> 03:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
we pulled it because he really didn't
 
03:34:18.790 --> 03:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
know either and we seen it july of 29th
 
03:34:21.990 --> 03:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
of 2018 hearings were held on this
 
03:34:24.150 --> 03:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
then it was put in the budget but
 
03:34:25.990 --> 03:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line somebody failed
 
03:34:27.190 --> 03:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
to fund it
 
03:34:30.070 --> 03:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
so it was in hb2 it wasn't uh except it
 
03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
was not made it over to hb1 am i correct
 
03:34:36.150 --> 03:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
yes okay so i this was out of the
 
03:34:38.389 --> 03:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
meetings after the ranking member on the
 
03:34:40.550 --> 03:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
democrats side uh we were both
 
03:34:42.950 --> 03:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
discussing this earlier on why i had to
 
03:34:44.710 --> 03:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
dig into a little bit more to see what i
 
03:34:47.670 --> 03:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
was dealing with because i had no clue
 
03:34:47.680 --> 03:34:48.550 align:start position:0%
was dealing with because i had no clue
so

03:34:48.550 --> 03:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:52.150 --> 03:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that will clarify in some mis
 
03:34:55.030 --> 03:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
some confusion that we had on this here
 
03:34:57.190 --> 03:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
on why maybe
 
03:34:59.670 --> 03:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
it needs to move forward because as the
 
03:35:00.950 --> 03:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
speaker said
 
03:35:02.229 --> 03:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
uh it's
 
03:35:04.309 --> 03:35:04.319 align:start position:0%
give them a million bob geider said
 
03:35:06.229 --> 03:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
let's see how it goes with that million
 
03:35:06.239 --> 03:35:07.269 align:start position:0%
let's see how it goes with that million
dollars

03:35:07.269 --> 03:35:07.279 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:35:09.349 --> 03:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
and then if it's not needed then we
 
03:35:11.750 --> 03:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
won't need to send the rest of the money
 
03:35:13.590 --> 03:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
but this is a
 
03:35:16.070 --> 03:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
you know a test run to see how much
 
03:35:18.150 --> 03:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
money they actually need for this
 
03:35:25.030 --> 03:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:28.229 --> 03:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
so this money goes to army what happens
 
03:35:31.510 --> 03:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
if another regenerative manufacturing
 
03:35:33.990 --> 03:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
group comes in are they able to tap into
 
03:35:36.070 --> 03:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
the money or is this exclusively for
 
03:35:36.080 --> 03:35:37.510 align:start position:0%
the money or is this exclusively for
army

03:35:37.510 --> 03:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
army
 
03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:45.190 --> 03:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
the program was set up specifically for
 
03:35:47.510 --> 03:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
army but i think if a regenerative
 
03:35:50.229 --> 03:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturing company came in
 
03:35:52.389 --> 03:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
they could exercise or they could ask
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
for the same
 
03:35:55.830 --> 03:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
the same uh
 
03:35:57.269 --> 03:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
criteria that
 
03:35:59.269 --> 03:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
was given to army but i think it would
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
have to be again you'd have to vote on
 
03:36:03.190 --> 03:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
it here in the legislature because
 
03:36:05.590 --> 03:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
zombie is the designated
 
03:36:08.389 --> 03:36:08.399 align:start position:0%
army is the designated receiver right
 
03:36:08.399 --> 03:36:09.590 align:start position:0%
army is the designated receiver right
now

03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:36:11.030 --> 03:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay the other question that i have
 
03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you senator the other question
 
03:36:16.229 --> 03:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
that i have is why is it non-lapsing
 
03:36:19.750 --> 03:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:21.750 --> 03:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's non-lapsing because if you don't
 
03:36:23.590 --> 03:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
they they continue to recruit and they
 
03:36:25.590 --> 03:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
haven't spent it in one year you don't
 
03:36:26.950 --> 03:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
want it to lap so you'd have to
 
03:36:28.950 --> 03:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
reappropriate in the second year so
 
03:36:31.590 --> 03:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
you'd retain it and you'd retain it over
 
03:36:36.630 --> 03:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
over a period of a a period of time
 
03:36:39.030 --> 03:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
you always want to keep recruiting
 
03:36:41.670 --> 03:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
so is there a time cap on that of five
 
03:36:44.870 --> 03:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
years or no uh
 
03:36:47.429 --> 03:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't i don't think so the the
 
03:36:49.670 --> 03:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
cap the cap was on the amount of money
 
03:36:51.990 --> 03:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
that we would give we would give five
 
03:36:54.309 --> 03:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
million dollars and they would have to
 
03:36:57.349 --> 03:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
be remade in employment for five years
 
03:37:00.950 --> 03:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
but they want to keep recruiting and so
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
if they couldn't get anybody in the
 
03:37:04.950 --> 03:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
first year make it non-lapsing would be
 
03:37:06.870 --> 03:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
attractive for the second year this is
 
03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
an on this is an ongoing process
 
03:37:12.469 --> 03:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
as far as recruitment is concerned
 
03:37:13.990 --> 03:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
they're going to be recruiting for
 
03:37:16.870 --> 03:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
quality people for a long period of time
 
03:37:19.349 --> 03:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
yeah under uh the rsa that i mentioned
 
03:37:20.870 --> 03:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
that's in the bill it basically goes
 
03:37:23.110 --> 03:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
into explains a lot of this here but it
 
03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
talks about bonding and other stuff i
 
03:37:27.190 --> 03:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
don't know bonding means the money that
 
03:37:30.950 --> 03:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
we're giving that will go to them
 
03:37:33.990 --> 03:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
it was a it was a i i if it spawned
 
03:37:35.990 --> 03:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
that was maybe a methodology that was
 
03:37:37.910 --> 03:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
discussed but indeed a direct
 
03:37:37.920 --> 03:37:39.190 align:start position:0%
discussed but indeed a direct
appropriation

03:37:39.190 --> 03:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
03:37:41.590 --> 03:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
is a much better way to do this
 
03:37:43.269 --> 03:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
and there's a there's another way to do
 
03:37:45.750 --> 03:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
this that we're working on uh you know
 
03:37:47.670 --> 03:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
in order to come up with the with the
 
03:37:49.590 --> 03:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
money but i i think uh you could have
 
03:37:51.429 --> 03:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
done a board but
 
03:37:53.269 --> 03:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that was an appropriate
 
03:37:54.469 --> 03:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
way to do it
 
03:37:56.389 --> 03:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
if the a better alternative were
 
03:37:56.399 --> 03:38:03.110 align:start position:0%
if the a better alternative were
available

03:38:03.110 --> 03:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:04.389 --> 03:38:04.399 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:38:05.429 --> 03:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:38:07.269 --> 03:38:07.279 align:start position:0%
because i need to keep it simple for me
 
03:38:07.279 --> 03:38:08.389 align:start position:0%
because i need to keep it simple for me
uh

03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:38:10.389 --> 03:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
the house and the senate have already
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
agreed on the policy dating back to 2018
 
03:38:16.389 --> 03:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
we had already agreed on a dollar amount
 
03:38:19.030 --> 03:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
much larger than a million dollars right
 
03:38:21.110 --> 03:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
and and so we're just
 
03:38:22.710 --> 03:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
trying to resolve
 
03:38:25.190 --> 03:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh sort of a legislative faux pas that
 
03:38:26.950 --> 03:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't actually put the money where
 
03:38:29.990 --> 03:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
our mouth was yeah exactly uh what we're
 
03:38:32.790 --> 03:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
trying to do is fulfill a legislative
 
03:38:32.800 --> 03:38:34.229 align:start position:0%
trying to do is fulfill a legislative
follow-up

03:38:34.229 --> 03:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:38:36.550 --> 03:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay so because because of that i i
 
03:38:38.469 --> 03:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
think i can just support it but
 
03:38:40.710 --> 03:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh i wanna i wanna talk about the
 
03:38:42.550 --> 03:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing thing because i think that's
 
03:38:44.229 --> 03:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
an interesting comment
 
03:38:44.239 --> 03:38:45.349 align:start position:0%
an interesting comment
um

03:38:45.349 --> 03:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:48.150 --> 03:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
i i um i see that it needs to be
 
03:38:51.510 --> 03:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing because uh otherwise uh if
 
03:38:54.150 --> 03:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
we did this now it would expire june
 
03:38:56.710 --> 03:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
30th and that's just not enough time to
 
03:38:58.229 --> 03:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
do anything
 
03:39:01.110 --> 03:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
but it does make me wonder if since
 
03:39:02.950 --> 03:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
since we really don't know what the
 
03:39:04.950 --> 03:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
uptake rate is
 
03:39:07.510 --> 03:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
if we should in order to keep from this
 
03:39:08.710 --> 03:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
money getting
 
03:39:11.189 --> 03:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
you know pigeonholed and lost
 
03:39:13.429 --> 03:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
if we should put in
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh a lapse date of of 23 june 23
 
03:39:19.750 --> 03:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:39:21.990 --> 03:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
the lapsing it gives us budget
 
03:39:23.990 --> 03:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
discipline and and helps the accounting
 
03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
system keep track of the money which
 
03:39:28.469 --> 03:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
reduces fraud waste and abuse which is a
 
03:39:29.510 --> 03:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
03:39:32.389 --> 03:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
so so what what what are your comments
 
03:39:32.399 --> 03:39:33.590 align:start position:0%
so so what what what are your comments
on

03:39:33.590 --> 03:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:39:35.269 --> 03:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
maybe we should say
 
03:39:40.950 --> 03:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing until june 30 2023.
 
03:39:43.670 --> 03:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
well good comments appreciate those i
 
03:39:43.680 --> 03:39:44.630 align:start position:0%
well good comments appreciate those i
think

03:39:44.630 --> 03:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:39:48.229 --> 03:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
because it's a recruitment situation
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
and and you know
 
03:39:53.189 --> 03:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
you know that it takes a lot of time to
 
03:39:55.830 --> 03:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
get the to get these individuals
 
03:39:59.429 --> 03:39:59.439 align:start position:0%
you should give them a time period
 
03:40:01.590 --> 03:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
maybe a couple of years and
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
haven't lapsed in a couple or three
 
03:40:05.429 --> 03:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
years because they're constantly
 
03:40:07.750 --> 03:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
recruiting for the best people for these
 
03:40:10.469 --> 03:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
positions these these people are hard to
 
03:40:10.479 --> 03:40:11.510 align:start position:0%
positions these these people are hard to
find

03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
find
 
03:40:14.070 --> 03:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
and it i think you talked about advanced
 
03:40:17.189 --> 03:40:17.199 align:start position:0%
advanced studies people and so forth so
 
03:40:20.070 --> 03:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
i i think the non-lapsing feature
 
03:40:22.389 --> 03:40:22.399 align:start position:0%
and again they don't get the money that
 
03:40:24.630 --> 03:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
money would be held by the state and
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
would be distributed once good
 
03:40:28.630 --> 03:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
candidates come and the army comes in it
 
03:40:30.469 --> 03:40:30.479 align:start position:0%
goes through the process i think
 
03:40:30.479 --> 03:40:31.269 align:start position:0%
goes through the process i think
uh

03:40:31.269 --> 03:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:40:33.510 --> 03:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
what what's his what's the person's name
 
03:40:33.520 --> 03:40:34.630 align:start position:0%
what what's his what's the person's name
uh

03:40:34.630 --> 03:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:40:37.030 --> 03:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh who would
 
03:40:39.670 --> 03:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
the old industrial development authority
 
03:40:41.590 --> 03:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
what's that called what's that the uh
 
03:40:43.510 --> 03:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the military base
 
03:40:45.189 --> 03:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
no no no no no the industrial
 
03:40:46.710 --> 03:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
development authority used to handle
 
03:40:49.269 --> 03:40:49.279 align:start position:0%
grants a lot like like this but now it's
 
03:40:52.389 --> 03:40:52.399 align:start position:0%
it's uh kiwi what's his name
 
03:40:55.110 --> 03:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
key wallace key wallace's key wallace's
 
03:40:57.670 --> 03:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
entity would handle the money the money
 
03:41:00.550 --> 03:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
would never go to army the money would
 
03:41:02.469 --> 03:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
be retained by the state
 
03:41:04.630 --> 03:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
army would would then make a
 
03:41:07.990 --> 03:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation based on the employee
 
03:41:10.229 --> 03:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
key wallace would then give give them
 
03:41:11.990 --> 03:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
the money so that's that's that's why
 
03:41:14.710 --> 03:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
the non-lapsing feature i think is a
 
03:41:15.990 --> 03:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
good one because the money's always
 
03:41:17.990 --> 03:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
retained by the state senator i'm going
 
03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
to go with another follow-up in a second
 
03:41:21.429 --> 03:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
but what you just said bob gotta told me
 
03:41:23.590 --> 03:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
at lunch time that the way they found
 
03:41:25.269 --> 03:41:25.279 align:start position:0%
out the money wasn't funded because
 
03:41:27.349 --> 03:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
people went in for the grant and there
 
03:41:28.950 --> 03:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
was no money they found out that it was
 
03:41:32.070 --> 03:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
never funded so there was a mistake on
 
03:41:34.389 --> 03:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
on our part the house and the senate
 
03:41:36.469 --> 03:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
and that was coming from senator geider
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
but follow up
 
03:41:41.110 --> 03:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
okay so i i just want to probe the
 
03:41:44.070 --> 03:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing issue just another time and
 
03:41:46.870 --> 03:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
that is and maybe mr williams could has
 
03:41:49.110 --> 03:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
an answer to this because it's it's he's
 
03:41:51.510 --> 03:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
got experience in this area
 
03:41:53.830 --> 03:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
have we ever set things up so that it
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
would be non-lapsing at the end of the
 
03:41:59.269 --> 03:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
next budget cycle like so for example if
 
03:42:01.269 --> 03:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
if we bought into the idea that it's
 
03:42:02.790 --> 03:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
going to take a while to get the
 
03:42:04.630 --> 03:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
recruiting but at the same time we
 
03:42:06.710 --> 03:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to safety guard it so that this
 
03:42:09.510 --> 03:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
money isn't out there in perturbity
 
03:42:12.229 --> 03:42:12.239 align:start position:0%
could could we set it up as non-lapsing
 
03:42:16.229 --> 03:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
for june of 2025 which would be the
 
03:42:18.630 --> 03:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
entire next budget cycle i think we do
 
03:42:20.950 --> 03:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
with the veterans scholarship fund
 
03:42:22.790 --> 03:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
the money we used to put in there kept
 
03:42:25.189 --> 03:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
rolling over and over but go ahead do
 
03:42:27.830 --> 03:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
you have an answer mr williams
 
03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much uh and and uh
 
03:42:32.389 --> 03:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for this opportunity
 
03:42:33.990 --> 03:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
for the record john williams the
 
03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
director of legislative affairs for
 
03:42:36.870 --> 03:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
health and services and i have worked on
 
03:42:38.150 --> 03:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
the budget process and i was trying to
 
03:42:39.750 --> 03:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
make some eye contact with former
 
03:42:41.349 --> 03:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
representative aaron hennessey now in
 
03:42:42.870 --> 03:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
the senate and she's also had experience
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
in this deferring to the the working
 
03:42:47.110 --> 03:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
with the legislative budget assistance
 
03:42:49.670 --> 03:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
office uh you can certainly push it out
 
03:42:52.150 --> 03:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
to having the funds lapsing on a date
 
03:42:53.750 --> 03:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
certain typically at the end of a state
 
03:42:56.710 --> 03:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year uh generally the state has
 
03:42:58.229 --> 03:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
been very conservative to pushing it out
 
03:43:00.070 --> 03:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
too far you hear about encumbering
 
03:43:02.070 --> 03:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
future legislators but i've seen recent
 
03:43:04.710 --> 03:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
examples of pushing it into the upcoming
 
03:43:04.720 --> 03:43:06.950 align:start position:0%
examples of pushing it into the upcoming
biennium

03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
03:43:07.910 --> 03:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:09.910 --> 03:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
so the short answer was yes we could go
 
03:43:13.030 --> 03:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
to june 20 25. unfortunately the juris
 
03:43:14.950 --> 03:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
doctored it and by name adds a few words
 
03:43:16.870 --> 03:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
to it so but yes thank you
 
03:43:18.870 --> 03:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative hennessey thank you i
 
03:43:20.710 --> 03:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
mean senator hennessey i keep saying
 
03:43:21.830 --> 03:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
03:43:21.840 --> 03:43:24.469 align:start position:0%
that's okay
sorry

03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:26.150 --> 03:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
mr chairman can you tell me since you've
 
03:43:29.830 --> 03:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
read that today does it say that a an
 
03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
applicant would would have a five-year
 
03:43:34.870 --> 03:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
payout because they have a five-year
 
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
commitment my concern is if we make this
 
03:43:40.950 --> 03:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
fund lapse in two or three years that
 
03:43:42.550 --> 03:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
somebody who has made the five-year
 
03:43:42.560 --> 03:43:44.229 align:start position:0%
somebody who has made the five-year
commitment

03:43:44.229 --> 03:43:44.239 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
03:43:45.670 --> 03:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
is going to get stuck with something and
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
this is similar to state loan repayment
 
03:43:51.990 --> 03:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
program funds where we've made that fund
 
03:43:54.790 --> 03:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
um non-lapsing i believe so that we
 
03:43:54.800 --> 03:43:56.469 align:start position:0%
um non-lapsing i believe so that we
don't

03:43:56.469 --> 03:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:43:59.189 --> 03:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
get people stuck
 
03:44:00.950 --> 03:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
i i know senator geider was taught the
 
03:44:02.469 --> 03:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
way he was talking like a four or five
 
03:44:04.229 --> 03:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
year program this is
 
03:44:06.070 --> 03:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh that's involved and then every year
 
03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
more and more kids uh students come
 
03:44:11.189 --> 03:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
forward to sign up so the money has to
 
03:44:14.150 --> 03:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
be ready available and if you go i would
 
03:44:15.750 --> 03:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
think if you go after that five-year
 
03:44:18.229 --> 03:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
process it's going to cause problems
 
03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh i would think with students that are
 
03:44:21.750 --> 03:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
stepping up until
 
03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
you decide to fund it and they see how
 
03:44:26.070 --> 03:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
the million dollars went
 
03:44:27.910 --> 03:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
i i don't think you paid that
 
03:44:30.630 --> 03:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
again this is this is a supposition
 
03:44:33.030 --> 03:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
because the rules are in place
 
03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
but i don't think you pay it all off at
 
03:44:37.429 --> 03:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
once that you pay the loan off on an
 
03:44:39.189 --> 03:44:39.199 align:start position:0%
incremental basis that's how you retain
 
03:44:40.790 --> 03:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
it for the five years
 
03:44:43.349 --> 03:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
and that's why the non-lapsing nature it
 
03:44:45.590 --> 03:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
is so imperative because once the guy
 
03:44:47.830 --> 03:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
signs up the middle the woman signs on
 
03:44:49.349 --> 03:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
for five they want to be sure that
 
03:44:50.950 --> 03:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to get there
 
03:44:53.349 --> 03:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
get their their loan
 
03:44:53.359 --> 03:44:54.950 align:start position:0%
get their their loan
rescinded

03:44:54.950 --> 03:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
rescinded
 
03:44:54.960 --> 03:44:55.670 align:start position:0%
rescinded
yeah

03:44:55.670 --> 03:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:44:58.229 --> 03:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
i mean it's truly it's truly uh from
 
03:44:59.910 --> 03:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
their standpoint i think
 
03:45:03.030 --> 03:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a workforce
 
03:45:03.040 --> 03:45:04.309 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a workforce
recruitment

03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
recruitment
 
03:45:06.790 --> 03:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
tool that they perceive that that they
 
03:45:08.790 --> 03:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
need to get the kind of people that they
 
03:45:10.389 --> 03:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
need to get into this
 
03:45:13.269 --> 03:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
to this area of of business yeah it's a
 
03:45:15.670 --> 03:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
very sophisticated business follow-up if
 
03:45:15.680 --> 03:45:16.550 align:start position:0%
very sophisticated business follow-up if
sure

03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:45:19.030 --> 03:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair so
 
03:45:21.030 --> 03:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
so the way i understand something like
 
03:45:22.630 --> 03:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
this would work is if we put this
 
03:45:25.189 --> 03:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
million dollars in now and we set it up
 
03:45:28.469 --> 03:45:28.479 align:start position:0%
with the guard rails of expiring in in
 
03:45:30.309 --> 03:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
essentially three years
 
03:45:32.950 --> 03:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
we'll have gone through two full budget
 
03:45:36.550 --> 03:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
cycles before the end of 25
 
03:45:39.590 --> 03:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
and so if it requires more money in
 
03:45:41.510 --> 03:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
order to make good on the five-year
 
03:45:44.030 --> 03:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
commitments future legislature
 
03:45:46.710 --> 03:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
legislators could put that money in
 
03:45:46.720 --> 03:45:47.830 align:start position:0%
legislators could put that money in
there

03:45:47.830 --> 03:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:45:50.950 --> 03:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
but this million dollars would be set up
 
03:45:52.550 --> 03:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
to where there would be you know
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
accountability and control and
 
03:45:55.359 --> 03:45:56.150 align:start position:0%
accountability and control and
and

03:45:56.150 --> 03:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
and hopefully since we thought it would
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
cost five million and this is only one
 
03:46:03.910 --> 03:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
million it'll probably be spent by the
 
03:46:06.550 --> 03:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
end of the end of the three years so i i
 
03:46:08.550 --> 03:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
don't i don't know instinctively i i
 
03:46:10.710 --> 03:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
think it may be a good idea to go ahead
 
03:46:13.110 --> 03:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
and have the money lapse in at the end
 
03:46:14.710 --> 03:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
of 25.
 
03:46:17.429 --> 03:46:17.439 align:start position:0%
uh if i may uh go ahead before i go to
 
03:46:19.349 --> 03:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
the ways and means wanted to speak up on
 
03:46:21.670 --> 03:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
it that's why but go ahead senator yeah
 
03:46:25.030 --> 03:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
so i just have a concern if we
 
03:46:26.870 --> 03:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
give this million dollars and then make
 
03:46:29.670 --> 03:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
it lap actually for years that it says
 
03:46:31.429 --> 03:46:31.439 align:start position:0%
no forgiveness of such student
 
03:46:33.830 --> 03:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
indebtedness shall be affected unless
 
03:46:36.070 --> 03:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
the person shall have been employed to
 
03:46:38.309 --> 03:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
perform primarily active regenerative
 
03:46:40.550 --> 03:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturing business activities at a
 
03:46:42.229 --> 03:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
location within new hampshire for a
 
03:46:44.389 --> 03:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
minimum period of five years
 
03:46:45.910 --> 03:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
so if somebody
 
03:46:47.269 --> 03:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
comes to new hampshire because they know
 
03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to get their student loans
 
03:46:51.189 --> 03:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
prepaid and they make that five year
 
03:46:51.199 --> 03:46:52.229 align:start position:0%
prepaid and they make that five year
commitment

03:46:52.229 --> 03:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
03:46:53.670 --> 03:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
because they see we just put a million
 
03:46:55.189 --> 03:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
dollars in here but then we take the
 
03:46:57.750 --> 03:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
money back in three years
 
03:46:58.710 --> 03:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work they're going to be
 
03:46:58.720 --> 03:46:59.429 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work they're going to be
asking

03:46:59.429 --> 03:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
asking
 
03:47:02.229 --> 03:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:03.830 --> 03:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
but no one would have had gotten that
 
03:47:03.840 --> 03:47:05.030 align:start position:0%
but no one would have had gotten that
money

03:47:05.030 --> 03:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
i gave my word the percent of the guider
 
03:47:08.630 --> 03:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
i would stick with the uh the law the
 
03:47:10.150 --> 03:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
way it's written because of what you
 
03:47:12.469 --> 03:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
just said that's why we read the law on
 
03:47:14.710 --> 03:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
the five-year window and i think if
 
03:47:16.150 --> 03:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
anything if they're gonna do it maybe do
 
03:47:19.110 --> 03:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
it at the five-year not three there may
 
03:47:21.110 --> 03:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
be because we'll go against the rsa
 
03:47:22.790 --> 03:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
that's in place there may be a chance
 
03:47:24.389 --> 03:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
where someone's already started a work
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
commitment and so they could get money
 
03:47:30.790 --> 03:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
sooner but um i think perhaps a
 
03:47:33.269 --> 03:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
another option would be that
 
03:47:35.110 --> 03:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
once a year someone has to go before
 
03:47:37.429 --> 03:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal and report on the fund balance so
 
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
that we know
 
03:47:40.229 --> 03:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
we we have
 
03:47:42.070 --> 03:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
don't interrupt your center but we've
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
got in a bill that that we passed we ask
 
03:47:47.670 --> 03:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
for an annual report
 
03:47:50.710 --> 03:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
from the from the the uh from army to
 
03:47:50.720 --> 03:47:51.510 align:start position:0%
from the from the the uh from army to
both

03:47:51.510 --> 03:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
both
 
03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
ways and means of the house ways and
 
03:47:54.870 --> 03:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
means of the senate finance of the house
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
and finance in the senate so they should
 
03:47:59.590 --> 03:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
be reporting on an annual basis as to a
 
03:48:02.150 --> 03:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
how the project's going it'd be how how
 
03:48:04.710 --> 03:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
this this situation is going and also
 
03:48:06.309 --> 03:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
key wallace would be
 
03:48:08.309 --> 03:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
i think under the setup would be in
 
03:48:10.309 --> 03:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
charge of this
 
03:48:12.389 --> 03:48:12.399 align:start position:0%
more reason to make it not lapsing
 
03:48:13.750 --> 03:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative brown you had something
 
03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
to add
 
03:48:18.070 --> 03:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
sorry i walked in the middle of this um
 
03:48:19.670 --> 03:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
so yeah i guess you know the back story
 
03:48:21.269 --> 03:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
on this i mean we passed the spell four
 
03:48:22.710 --> 03:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
03:48:25.830 --> 03:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh when we we did the um
 
03:48:27.670 --> 03:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
senator goddard myself and
 
03:48:29.030 --> 03:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative ames are on the tax
 
03:48:31.189 --> 03:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
expenditure review committee
 
03:48:33.189 --> 03:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
and we finally asked the army to come in
 
03:48:34.070 --> 03:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
because we're wondering what that's
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
going on
 
03:48:35.520 --> 03:48:36.550 align:start position:0%
going on
so

03:48:36.550 --> 03:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
key wallace was the first one to testify
 
03:48:40.630 --> 03:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
about the tuition part of the bill
 
03:48:42.710 --> 03:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
because there's the other the tax tax
 
03:48:44.469 --> 03:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
break part of the bill
 
03:48:47.269 --> 03:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
and that's when we discovered that
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
that we never funded i guess i asked him
 
03:48:50.550 --> 03:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
i said
 
03:48:52.950 --> 03:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
so you set up the rules you did all that
 
03:48:54.229 --> 03:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
okay so how many people are taking
 
03:48:56.309 --> 03:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
advantage of this he goes nobody i go
 
03:48:58.950 --> 03:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
why not well the house i mean let's say
 
03:49:00.790 --> 03:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
she never funded it
 
03:49:03.269 --> 03:49:03.279 align:start position:0%
so representative senator guida said
 
03:49:04.870 --> 03:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
i'll take care of it
 
03:49:07.510 --> 03:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
so he originally filed a bill
 
03:49:09.429 --> 03:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
i attached it to a labor bill
 
03:49:11.349 --> 03:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
was the wrong place to go
 
03:49:12.630 --> 03:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
it was ruled
 
03:49:16.229 --> 03:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
it was ruled non-germane by the speaker
 
03:49:17.590 --> 03:49:17.600 align:start position:0%
then they attached it to then they
 
03:49:19.110 --> 03:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
attached i think your finance committee
 
03:49:20.630 --> 03:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
attached it to
 
03:49:21.990 --> 03:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
03:49:24.550 --> 03:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
so understand that yes we're four years
 
03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
into 10 years 10 years at 10 years ends
 
03:49:29.910 --> 03:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
all this money reverts it's no good per
 
03:49:31.349 --> 03:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
what you were just reading senator
 
03:49:31.359 --> 03:49:32.389 align:start position:0%
what you were just reading senator
hennessey

03:49:32.389 --> 03:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
hennessey
 
03:49:33.750 --> 03:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
i think that i think you're uncovering
 
03:49:35.510 --> 03:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
something that we didn't really
 
03:49:37.590 --> 03:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
anticipate but no money's gone out in
 
03:49:38.550 --> 03:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
four years
 
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
there might be some money going out
 
03:49:42.630 --> 03:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
in in the coming years
 
03:49:45.030 --> 03:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
but the law of the law ends i mean it
 
03:49:47.590 --> 03:49:47.600 align:start position:0%
just ends and we would assume any any
 
03:49:49.189 --> 03:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
extra money that's sitting there would
 
03:49:49.199 --> 03:49:50.630 align:start position:0%
extra money that's sitting there would
just

03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:49:53.110 --> 03:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
not be allowed to be paid out
 
03:49:54.070 --> 03:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
i think that's something we got to
 
03:49:57.189 --> 03:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
clarify it sounds like um
 
03:49:58.469 --> 03:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
whether or not you want to clarify it
 
03:50:01.030 --> 03:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
here or not uh that's
 
03:50:03.670 --> 03:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
you know well the window says five years
 
03:50:06.070 --> 03:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
of uh students are there any stu no
 
03:50:07.670 --> 03:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
students are in the pipeline right now
 
03:50:09.510 --> 03:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
but i understand there were students
 
03:50:11.670 --> 03:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
that tried and couldn't get involved
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
because there was no you said there was
 
03:50:14.309 --> 03:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
no funding
 
03:50:16.870 --> 03:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
so right there's no funding if you do
 
03:50:18.469 --> 03:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
the three year like representative
 
03:50:20.070 --> 03:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
edward saying doesn't that cause a
 
03:50:21.990 --> 03:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
problem with somebody within a five year
 
03:50:22.000 --> 03:50:24.389 align:start position:0%
problem with somebody within a five year
window

03:50:24.389 --> 03:50:24.399 align:start position:0%
window
 
03:50:25.590 --> 03:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
yes because
 
03:50:27.429 --> 03:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
they they work five years and that's how
 
03:50:29.189 --> 03:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
you you redeem the note over the
 
03:50:30.870 --> 03:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
five-year period
 
03:50:32.229 --> 03:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
a portion of it
 
03:50:34.389 --> 03:50:34.399 align:start position:0%
on an individual basis that's i assume
 
03:50:35.990 --> 03:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's how the program was going to be
 
03:50:36.950 --> 03:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
set up
 
03:50:38.309 --> 03:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:50:38.319 --> 03:50:39.510 align:start position:0%
and uh
again

03:50:39.510 --> 03:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:50:40.550 --> 03:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
the key
 
03:50:42.229 --> 03:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
the key the key to keeping the
 
03:50:44.469 --> 03:50:44.479 align:start position:0%
individual there is the five years the
 
03:50:46.389 --> 03:50:46.399 align:start position:0%
redemption of the loan takes place over
 
03:50:49.750 --> 03:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
a five-year period representative
 
03:50:51.910 --> 03:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
okay so what i was uh obsessive
 
03:50:54.150 --> 03:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
compulsive about is the notion of some
 
03:50:57.830 --> 03:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
kind of a sunset date and a way to make
 
03:50:59.990 --> 03:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
the money accountable what i think i
 
03:51:02.229 --> 03:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
just heard representative abrami tell us
 
03:51:05.429 --> 03:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
is that the law itself sunsets in six
 
03:51:07.990 --> 03:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
more years and that we would probably
 
03:51:10.550 --> 03:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
sweep any funds that were still in this
 
03:51:14.309 --> 03:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
account so that takes care of my sunset
 
03:51:17.030 --> 03:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
obsession and i'm i'm i'll stop talking
 
03:51:19.750 --> 03:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
about it okay thank you
 
03:51:22.229 --> 03:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
did you have anything else yet
 
03:51:23.590 --> 03:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
no other than
 
03:51:25.030 --> 03:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
we asked uh
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
we asked the uh from army the uh
 
03:51:29.590 --> 03:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
associate director uh
 
03:51:31.510 --> 03:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
miss uh tui
 
03:51:31.520 --> 03:51:32.309 align:start position:0%
miss uh tui
uh

03:51:32.309 --> 03:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
about how important this is
 
03:51:35.910 --> 03:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
and she says well we just added another
 
03:51:38.550 --> 03:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
25 000 square feet
 
03:51:39.830 --> 03:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
we're still bringing people and we're
 
03:51:41.830 --> 03:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
still bringing companies in so she said
 
03:51:43.349 --> 03:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
this is very important that we we do
 
03:51:45.910 --> 03:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
have this to attract to attract these
 
03:51:48.229 --> 03:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
phd types that they want
 
03:51:50.150 --> 03:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's a win-win for new hampshire thank
 
03:51:52.469 --> 03:51:52.479 align:start position:0%
you uh we anyone else had anything to
 
03:51:55.429 --> 03:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
add before uh uh
 
03:52:00.309 --> 03:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:03.030 --> 03:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
i think we may be all set yeah i think
 
03:52:08.389 --> 03:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:10.630 --> 03:52:10.640 align:start position:0%

03:53:28.229 --> 03:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
each other yeah
 
03:53:28.239 --> 03:53:29.590 align:start position:0%
each other yeah
yeah

03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%

03:53:33.510 --> 03:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to close the committee uh
 
03:53:37.590 --> 03:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
conference on uh hb 1256 and i will file
 
03:53:40.150 --> 03:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
a report with the clerk and the
 
03:53:42.790 --> 03:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
um ols thank you well for coming and
 
03:53:55.349 --> 03:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:15.189 --> 03:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:29.510 --> 03:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:32.070 --> 03:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
before we put it on this bill i called
 
03:54:34.309 --> 03:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
representative allard the prime sponsor
 
03:54:35.830 --> 03:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure he was okay with it he
 
03:54:37.110 --> 03:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
thought it'd be a great bill to put it
 
03:54:39.189 --> 03:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
on since army does so much for that
 
03:54:41.189 --> 03:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
right for injured troops
 
03:54:42.389 --> 03:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
so we
 
03:54:44.469 --> 03:54:44.479 align:start position:0%

04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%

wait

uh
 
04:41:57.110 --> 04:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
gun stock has been
 
04:41:59.350 --> 04:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
the focus of a very unfortunate set of
 
04:41:59.360 --> 04:42:01.670 align:start position:0%
the focus of a very unfortunate set of
circumstances

04:42:01.670 --> 04:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
04:42:06.550 --> 04:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh in 1959 legislation was passed
 
04:42:09.510 --> 04:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
designed to prevent political
 
04:42:09.520 --> 04:42:10.868 align:start position:0%
designed to prevent political
interference

04:42:10.868 --> 04:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
interference
 
04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
in the business operations of the
 
04:42:14.150 --> 04:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
mountain very clear from the intended
 
04:42:14.160 --> 04:42:16.230 align:start position:0%
mountain very clear from the intended
legislation

04:42:16.230 --> 04:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:42:18.868 --> 04:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
it left a proviso in that law that
 
04:42:21.030 --> 04:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
allows the delegation
 
04:42:22.230 --> 04:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
to appoint the members of that
 
04:42:22.240 --> 04:42:25.030 align:start position:0%
to appoint the members of that
commission

04:42:25.030 --> 04:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:25.040 --> 04:42:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:31.270 --> 04:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
the delegation acting within its lawful
 
04:42:31.280 --> 04:42:32.708 align:start position:0%
the delegation acting within its lawful
authority

04:42:32.708 --> 04:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
authority
 
04:42:35.190 --> 04:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
but with misfeasance that's a legal term
 
04:42:37.510 --> 04:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
that means the inappropriate application
 
04:42:38.948 --> 04:42:38.958 align:start position:0%
of law
 
04:42:38.958 --> 04:42:40.868 align:start position:0%
of law
okay

04:42:40.868 --> 04:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:42:43.590 --> 04:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
has replaced
 
04:42:46.230 --> 04:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
most of that commission
 
04:42:49.270 --> 04:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
with people who are
 
04:42:49.280 --> 04:42:50.948 align:start position:0%
with people who are
unqualified

04:42:50.948 --> 04:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
unqualified
 
04:42:54.390 --> 04:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of professional background
 
04:42:56.788 --> 04:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
people who have political agenda
 
04:42:56.798 --> 04:42:57.670 align:start position:0%
people who have political agenda
again

04:42:57.670 --> 04:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:42:59.510 --> 04:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
in violation of the intent of that law
 
04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:02.958 --> 04:43:05.270 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:43:05.270 --> 04:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:08.470 --> 04:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
have caused significant distress amongst
 
04:43:11.350 --> 04:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
the population of belmont county to it
 
04:43:15.510 --> 04:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
two petitions with 3 600 signatures
 
04:43:17.590 --> 04:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
opposing the direction that the
 
04:43:19.590 --> 04:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
delegation is taking with its political
 
04:43:19.600 --> 04:43:21.030 align:start position:0%
delegation is taking with its political
maneuvering

04:43:21.030 --> 04:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
maneuvering
 
04:43:24.150 --> 04:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
to try to achieve a political outcome
 
04:43:26.070 --> 04:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
they have removed one person who was
 
04:43:28.708 --> 04:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
eminently competent mr mcclear
 
04:43:30.948 --> 04:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
who built church landing from a waste on
 
04:43:33.430 --> 04:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
the edge of lake winnipesaukee into the
 
04:43:36.628 --> 04:43:36.638 align:start position:0%
fantastic facility it is today
 
04:43:38.310 --> 04:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
they have isolated the
 
04:43:39.590 --> 04:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
former chair
 
04:43:40.628 --> 04:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
to wit
 
04:43:42.550 --> 04:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
they will not even entertain
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
agenda items that he is considering
 
04:43:46.470 --> 04:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
because he is from the group that
 
04:43:48.550 --> 04:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
developed this master plan what master
 
04:43:50.470 --> 04:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
plan they spent almost five years
 
04:43:52.868 --> 04:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
developing a master plan
 
04:43:52.878 --> 04:43:54.070 align:start position:0%
developing a master plan
and

04:43:54.070 --> 04:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:56.150 --> 04:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh that master plan
 
04:43:58.788 --> 04:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
presents a phased approach to possible
 
04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
improvements to gun stock to make sure
 
04:44:02.230 --> 04:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
that it is both up to date and
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
sustainable for the long term
 
04:44:04.080 --> 04:44:05.590 align:start position:0%
sustainable for the long term
now

04:44:05.590 --> 04:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:44:07.990 --> 04:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
the harm done by
 
04:44:08.000 --> 04:44:09.110 align:start position:0%
the harm done by
this

04:44:09.110 --> 04:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:44:09.120 --> 04:44:10.070 align:start position:0%
this
this

04:44:10.070 --> 04:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:44:10.080 --> 04:44:12.150 align:start position:0%
this
turnover

04:44:12.150 --> 04:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
turnover
 
04:44:13.350 --> 04:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
is that the team that they have
 
04:44:13.360 --> 04:44:14.550 align:start position:0%
is that the team that they have
dismantled

04:44:14.550 --> 04:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
dismantled
 
04:44:17.110 --> 04:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
produced a 9 million dollar
 
04:44:17.120 --> 04:44:18.390 align:start position:0%
produced a 9 million dollar
surplus

04:44:18.390 --> 04:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
surplus
 
04:44:20.708 --> 04:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
this year
 
04:44:22.868 --> 04:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
when for the past 63 years that the
 
04:44:25.190 --> 04:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
existing law was in place
 
04:44:27.030 --> 04:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
it was marginally profitable they had to
 
04:44:29.190 --> 04:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
borrow money from the county
 
04:44:30.628 --> 04:44:30.638 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
04:44:32.470 --> 04:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
and so what they've done is dismember
 
04:44:34.150 --> 04:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
the paradigm that was successfully
 
04:44:35.750 --> 04:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
making gun stock what it needs to be to
 
04:44:37.030 --> 04:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
be sustainable for the foreseeable
 
04:44:37.040 --> 04:44:39.990 align:start position:0%
be sustainable for the foreseeable
future

04:44:39.990 --> 04:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:40.000 --> 04:44:41.430 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:44:41.430 --> 04:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:44:43.350 --> 04:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
people of belknap county
 
04:44:45.350 --> 04:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
by the thousands have expressed their
 
04:44:47.990 --> 04:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
support for this amendment
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
and given the consequences of the
 
04:44:51.670 --> 04:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
actions of a delegation that is
 
04:44:53.830 --> 04:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
hell-bent on not caring about the
 
04:44:53.840 --> 04:44:56.150 align:start position:0%
hell-bent on not caring about the
electorate

04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
electorate
 
04:44:57.910 --> 04:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment has come forward and i
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
would ask you to vote in the affirmative
 
04:45:01.200 --> 04:45:06.550 align:start position:0%
would ask you to vote in the affirmative
senator

04:45:06.550 --> 04:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:08.948 --> 04:45:08.958 align:start position:0%
all i would i would add that
 
04:45:11.590 --> 04:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
this was passed on a voice vote through
 
04:45:14.550 --> 04:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
the through the senate um
 
04:45:16.470 --> 04:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
but i will also add
 
04:45:17.510 --> 04:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
i mean i
 
04:45:19.270 --> 04:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
probably should have just talked about
 
04:45:22.708 --> 04:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
the the underlying bill which was um
 
04:45:22.718 --> 04:45:23.670 align:start position:0%
the the underlying bill which was um
passed

04:45:23.670 --> 04:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
passed
 
04:45:26.948 --> 04:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
through your committee and that is also
 
04:45:29.670 --> 04:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
high support in the senate for the
 
04:45:29.680 --> 04:45:30.470 align:start position:0%
high support in the senate for the
um

04:45:30.470 --> 04:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:30.480 --> 04:45:31.510 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:45:31.510 --> 04:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
terms for some of the rockingham county
 
04:45:33.760 --> 04:45:39.110 align:start position:0%
terms for some of the rockingham county
elections

04:45:39.110 --> 04:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:15.670 --> 04:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
i would state that it is germane in the
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
sense that we are talking about
 
04:46:19.200 --> 04:46:21.750 align:start position:0%
sense that we are talking about
elections

04:46:21.750 --> 04:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
elections
 
04:46:23.670 --> 04:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
and terms of office
 
04:46:25.510 --> 04:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
i would also state that there's serious
 
04:46:26.788 --> 04:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
harm done
 
04:46:29.430 --> 04:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
with the continuing passage of time as
 
04:46:31.910 --> 04:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
more commissioners get elected this fall
 
04:46:34.070 --> 04:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
and so forth there is harm done has
 
04:46:35.510 --> 04:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
already been done to the institution of
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
gun stock
 
04:46:39.350 --> 04:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
and so again i believe that because it's
 
04:46:41.590 --> 04:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
a bill related to elections that it is
 
04:46:43.590 --> 04:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
germaine it should be considered that
 
04:46:55.750 --> 04:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:58.310 --> 04:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair with all due respect
 
04:46:58.320 --> 04:46:59.590 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair with all due respect
um

04:46:59.590 --> 04:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:01.110 --> 04:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
04:47:03.190 --> 04:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
is is not germane
 
04:47:05.110 --> 04:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
and in fact
 
04:47:07.430 --> 04:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
because the chair of
 
04:47:10.230 --> 04:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
election law and municipal affairs
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
determined it to be non-germane that
 
04:47:14.070 --> 04:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
there was a hearing
 
04:47:16.708 --> 04:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
because of its non-germaness so
 
04:47:19.430 --> 04:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
i i don't um
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
i don't agree with that assertion that
 
04:47:27.510 --> 04:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:29.430 --> 04:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
while it may not be germaine it is
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
attached to the bill and it did pass the
 
04:47:33.910 --> 04:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
senate so as far as we're concerned it
 
04:47:37.030 --> 04:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
is um a part of the bill and i also was
 
04:47:39.030 --> 04:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
requested mr chair if you could turn
 
04:47:42.470 --> 04:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
04:47:48.470 --> 04:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
i'd like to keep it quiet
 
04:47:48.480 --> 04:47:49.510 align:start position:0%
i'd like to keep it quiet
uh

04:47:49.510 --> 04:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:47:53.350 --> 04:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
any other comments yes representative
 
04:47:55.670 --> 04:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
04:47:58.628 --> 04:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
i completely support
 
04:48:01.110 --> 04:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
the notion of having gunstock elected
 
04:48:02.708 --> 04:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
when i started in
 
04:48:06.070 --> 04:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
local government 22 years ago
 
04:48:09.270 --> 04:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
the first i came on the heels of a
 
04:48:11.990 --> 04:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
warrant article to change the zba in
 
04:48:14.550 --> 04:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
northampton from an appointed
 
04:48:17.670 --> 04:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
body to an elected body because of
 
04:48:19.750 --> 04:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
everything that i'm hearing here that's
 
04:48:23.510 --> 04:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
happening in gunstock and since then
 
04:48:27.270 --> 04:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
the zba has moved along quietly
 
04:48:29.830 --> 04:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
and with efficiency
 
04:48:31.750 --> 04:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
and without the political turmoil that
 
04:48:33.910 --> 04:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
comes with that can come with
 
04:48:33.920 --> 04:48:35.910 align:start position:0%
comes with that can come with
appointments

04:48:35.910 --> 04:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
04:48:35.920 --> 04:48:36.708 align:start position:0%
appointments
i

04:48:36.708 --> 04:48:36.718 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:48:38.708 --> 04:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
when i first read this
 
04:48:38.718 --> 04:48:39.510 align:start position:0%
when i first read this
i

04:48:39.510 --> 04:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:48:41.830 --> 04:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
i'm still new as a sophomore here i i
 
04:48:43.830 --> 04:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
question my understanding of the word
 
04:48:43.840 --> 04:48:44.868 align:start position:0%
question my understanding of the word
germaine

04:48:44.868 --> 04:48:44.878 align:start position:0%
germaine
 
04:48:46.628 --> 04:48:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh as i've seen it with a few different
 
04:48:48.390 --> 04:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
bills i think germain means the subject
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
matter needs to be to relate to one
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
another but i understand here it's a
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
little bit different we have a bill in
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
front of us with two parts to it
 
04:48:59.510 --> 04:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
i support both parts of this bill
 
04:49:02.550 --> 04:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
um if if
 
04:49:04.310 --> 04:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
but i so
 
04:49:07.430 --> 04:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
not being 100 sure of how we can get
 
04:49:09.670 --> 04:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
both of these to pass i'm willing to do
 
04:49:11.590 --> 04:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
whatever it takes to get both pieces of
 
04:49:14.708 --> 04:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
these to pass because as i understand it
 
04:49:16.628 --> 04:49:16.638 align:start position:0%
the gun stock piece would take place in
 
04:49:18.150 --> 04:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
the 22
 
04:49:20.230 --> 04:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
election which would be november
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
so if this were to pass and be signed in
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
june then we could have an effective
 
04:49:26.470 --> 04:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
transition in november
 
04:49:28.150 --> 04:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
um i just don't understand how that
 
04:49:30.070 --> 04:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
would happen unless we can do it as one
 
04:49:32.788 --> 04:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
piece right here but so uh i don't know
 
04:49:34.150 --> 04:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
that i've offered a solution but i've
 
04:49:36.868 --> 04:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
offered my opinion thank you
 
04:49:38.390 --> 04:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
04:49:38.400 --> 04:49:39.190 align:start position:0%
any other comments
yes

04:49:39.190 --> 04:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:49:41.190 --> 04:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair i
 
04:49:45.190 --> 04:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
would also like to add that um
 
04:49:48.230 --> 04:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
because of the seriousness of the
 
04:49:51.190 --> 04:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
content of this amendment
 
04:49:54.948 --> 04:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
it makes substantial changes to
 
04:49:59.350 --> 04:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
the 1959 law that's been working for 63
 
04:49:59.360 --> 04:50:01.830 align:start position:0%
the 1959 law that's been working for 63
years

04:50:01.830 --> 04:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
04:50:06.310 --> 04:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the process and the way
 
04:50:08.310 --> 04:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
04:50:09.910 --> 04:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
being brought about
 
04:50:11.430 --> 04:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
it needs to be
 
04:50:14.230 --> 04:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
filed as an lsr and it needs to go
 
04:50:15.830 --> 04:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
through the process
 
04:50:19.270 --> 04:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be heard in in the house
 
04:50:19.280 --> 04:50:21.030 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be heard in in the house
so

04:50:21.030 --> 04:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's an important um
 
04:50:23.760 --> 04:50:27.350 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's an important um
consideration

04:50:27.350 --> 04:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
so let me let me ask before we get too
 
04:50:32.868 --> 04:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
far down the road we're still going to
 
04:50:34.470 --> 04:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
be shooting for three o'clock but if we
 
04:50:37.350 --> 04:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
go over we'll go
 
04:50:38.628 --> 04:50:38.638 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
04:50:41.030 --> 04:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
is this is the position
 
04:50:43.030 --> 04:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
of the senate
 
04:50:43.040 --> 04:50:43.830 align:start position:0%
of the senate
uh

04:50:43.830 --> 04:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:50:46.470 --> 04:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
pretty hard at this point or i do have
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
do you have much uh
 
04:50:51.750 --> 04:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
willingness to have some leeway here
 
04:50:54.708 --> 04:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
i think the senate position is very firm
 
04:50:57.590 --> 04:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
and i would offer in rebuttal
 
04:50:59.430 --> 04:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
that the system has not been working
 
04:51:01.350 --> 04:51:01.360 align:start position:0%
given the marginal financial performance
 
04:51:03.110 --> 04:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
for 63 years
 
04:51:05.910 --> 04:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
when this when the
 
04:51:08.230 --> 04:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
team that put a 9 million dollar surplus
 
04:51:09.590 --> 04:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the bank
 
04:51:11.830 --> 04:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay is being dismantled for political
 
04:51:11.840 --> 04:51:13.110 align:start position:0%
okay is being dismantled for political
reasons

04:51:13.110 --> 04:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
04:51:14.708 --> 04:51:14.718 align:start position:0%
that is not working
 
04:51:17.110 --> 04:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
and gun stock according to 3 600
 
04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
signatories on a petition for a county
 
04:51:22.310 --> 04:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
unheard of i've never in in 30 years in
 
04:51:22.320 --> 04:51:23.910 align:start position:0%
unheard of i've never in in 30 years in
politics

04:51:23.910 --> 04:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
politics
 
04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
seen a county issue raised such a level
 
04:51:28.470 --> 04:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
over 300 articles in the paper
 
04:51:30.550 --> 04:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
okay numerous letters to the editor
 
04:51:32.550 --> 04:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
scurrilous scandalous remarks about
 
04:51:32.560 --> 04:51:33.670 align:start position:0%
scurrilous scandalous remarks about
myself

04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
myself
 
04:51:35.910 --> 04:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
my sonal agenda here is putting the
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
future of gun stock
 
04:51:40.070 --> 04:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay a time critical decision has to be
 
04:51:42.390 --> 04:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
made we can't wait two more years okay
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
putting the future of gun stock in the
 
04:51:45.190 --> 04:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
hands of its owners
 
04:51:46.708 --> 04:51:46.718 align:start position:0%
letting the public vote on the people
 
04:51:48.948 --> 04:51:48.958 align:start position:0%
they want to run their mountain
 
04:51:50.470 --> 04:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
if we deny that we say they're not
 
04:51:52.708 --> 04:51:52.718 align:start position:0%
competent that's what we're saying here
 
04:51:54.310 --> 04:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
and i disagree with that notion thank
 
04:51:56.390 --> 04:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
you mr chair thank you senator uh i
 
04:51:58.230 --> 04:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
think at this point
 
04:51:59.990 --> 04:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes senator
 
04:52:03.430 --> 04:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
can we recess for about five minutes yes
 
04:52:05.910 --> 04:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
that was going to be my next comment was
 
04:52:09.110 --> 04:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
that i think we probably need to
 
04:52:10.550 --> 04:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
caucus if you will if that's the right
 
04:52:12.390 --> 04:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
term the senate
 
04:52:13.750 --> 04:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh members
 
04:52:15.830 --> 04:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh about five minutes talk about your
 
04:52:18.230 --> 04:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
position and the the house will do the
 
04:52:21.270 --> 04:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
same and will reconvene at three
 
04:52:21.280 --> 04:52:22.230 align:start position:0%
same and will reconvene at three
right

04:52:22.230 --> 04:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:52:27.830 --> 04:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:31.030 --> 04:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:51.350 --> 05:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:53.830 --> 05:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
where we have another
 
05:01:55.190 --> 05:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee of conference that was
 
05:01:57.190 --> 05:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to start at three so we're
 
05:01:58.708 --> 05:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
going to move through this quickly if it
 
05:02:01.350 --> 05:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
looks like we're we're not going to
 
05:02:02.868 --> 05:02:02.878 align:start position:0%
be able to get through this rather
 
05:02:02.878 --> 05:02:04.070 align:start position:0%
be able to get through this rather
rapidly

05:02:04.070 --> 05:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
rapidly
 
05:02:06.390 --> 05:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
i'll suspend our discussion and we'll
 
05:02:10.470 --> 05:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am i i have another one that's
 
05:02:15.910 --> 05:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
suspended to 3 30 and then 3 45 can we
 
05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
do four
 
05:02:17.520 --> 05:02:19.430 align:start position:0%
do four
sure

05:02:19.430 --> 05:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:02:19.440 --> 05:02:21.990 align:start position:0%
sure
um

05:02:21.990 --> 05:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:25.030 --> 05:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:27.510 --> 05:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
our the house position at this point our
 
05:02:27.520 --> 05:02:28.628 align:start position:0%
our the house position at this point our
position

05:02:28.628 --> 05:02:28.638 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:02:31.830 --> 05:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
we're not going to allow this bill to
 
05:02:34.948 --> 05:02:34.958 align:start position:0%
move forward unless the senate proceeds
 
05:02:39.270 --> 05:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:42.070 --> 05:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
and the senate's position is they both
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:48.868 --> 05:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
okay and so we're at a
 
05:02:52.230 --> 05:02:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:55.750 --> 05:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
might i suggest a recess
 
05:02:55.760 --> 05:02:56.788 align:start position:0%
might i suggest a recess
well

05:02:56.788 --> 05:02:56.798 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:02:58.390 --> 05:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
we could do that but we won't get back
 
05:02:59.830 --> 05:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
together until four
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
all right well if we have time now it's
 
05:03:03.350 --> 05:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
what well you have a level you have
 
05:03:03.360 --> 05:03:04.310 align:start position:0%
what well you have a level you have
another

05:03:04.310 --> 05:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:03:05.990 --> 05:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
committee of conference supposed to
 
05:03:09.990 --> 05:03:10.000 align:start position:0%

05:03:37.440 --> 05:03:42.310 align:start position:0%
at uh approximately four
o'clock

05:03:42.310 --> 05:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:45.510 --> 05:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
this is typical this is what is going on
 
05:03:51.030 --> 05:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
this one's for you you can read as you
 
05:03:54.868 --> 05:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:15.830 --> 05:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:15.840 --> 05:04:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
hey

05:04:51.990 --> 05:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i think there's an amendment from
 
05:05:05.270 --> 05:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:12.310 --> 05:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:16.628 --> 05:06:16.638 align:start position:0%

with one of the one of the senators like
 
05:06:59.990 --> 05:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
to take the lead and explain sure your
 
05:07:01.350 --> 05:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
position thank you
 
05:07:03.670 --> 05:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
um and and uh thank you representative
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
for creating a bill that we love so much
 
05:07:07.750 --> 05:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
that we added things to it
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
um but i will say you know we appreciate
 
05:07:11.990 --> 05:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
it very much the um bill coming over
 
05:07:13.510 --> 05:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
from the house i think a very necessary
 
05:07:15.270 --> 05:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
change and uh
 
05:07:17.750 --> 05:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
as you know des
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
thought that this would be an
 
05:07:20.150 --> 05:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity to clear up some things that
 
05:07:21.910 --> 05:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
needed to be cleared up for a number of
 
05:07:24.708 --> 05:07:24.718 align:start position:0%
years and be a good vehicle uh for that
 
05:07:26.470 --> 05:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
and then thirdly um there was the
 
05:07:29.430 --> 05:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity from president morse to um
 
05:07:31.590 --> 05:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
put money into the
 
05:07:34.550 --> 05:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
pfas fund and i'll go into that just a
 
05:07:37.190 --> 05:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
little bit um we
 
05:07:39.110 --> 05:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
i think i guess with my bill a few years
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
ago established that fund because we saw
 
05:07:44.390 --> 05:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
the pfas crisis looming and was going to
 
05:07:46.708 --> 05:07:46.718 align:start position:0%
provide uh funding which we thought
 
05:07:48.070 --> 05:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
you know grants that could go out to
 
05:07:49.430 --> 05:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities for the municipal
 
05:07:51.030 --> 05:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment
 
05:07:52.948 --> 05:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
systems and um of course this is all
 
05:07:54.230 --> 05:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
assuming at some point we're going to
 
05:07:55.990 --> 05:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
win the suit against 3m and this will
 
05:07:57.430 --> 05:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
get all reimbursed to the state and so
 
05:07:59.430 --> 05:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
on but the important have that fund
 
05:08:01.990 --> 05:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
and it had been our intent when we set
 
05:08:03.990 --> 05:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
up that that the way it was going to be
 
05:08:05.190 --> 05:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
going through
 
05:08:07.990 --> 05:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
the des that private well owners could
 
05:08:09.430 --> 05:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
get help from it
 
05:08:12.230 --> 05:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
and uh there you know that i think there
 
05:08:14.230 --> 05:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
was a sense last year with some changes
 
05:08:16.628 --> 05:08:16.638 align:start position:0%
made to it and this to make sure that
 
05:08:18.868 --> 05:08:18.878 align:start position:0%
that legislative intent is there because
 
05:08:20.708 --> 05:08:20.718 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing merrimack you know you
 
05:08:21.750 --> 05:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
name it
 
05:08:23.990 --> 05:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
um this chemical is the gift that keeps
 
05:08:25.350 --> 05:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
on giving we're going to be finding our
 
05:08:25.360 --> 05:08:26.230 align:start position:0%
on giving we're going to be finding our
wells

05:08:26.230 --> 05:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
wells
 
05:08:27.990 --> 05:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
in lots of places around around the
 
05:08:29.510 --> 05:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
state so there's an opportunity to
 
05:08:31.670 --> 05:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
clarify that and then to put 25 million
 
05:08:34.150 --> 05:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
dollars which the senate president had
 
05:08:36.708 --> 05:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
secured into that fund so we would have
 
05:08:38.070 --> 05:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
money as needed
 
05:08:40.390 --> 05:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
what made this um particularly
 
05:08:42.788 --> 05:08:42.798 align:start position:0%
opportune was the number of bills we had
 
05:08:44.550 --> 05:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
coming from the house about merrimack
 
05:08:46.230 --> 05:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
and about other places and we had to
 
05:08:48.390 --> 05:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
hold a couple of them because we were
 
05:08:50.470 --> 05:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
not sure they passed continental muster
 
05:08:52.628 --> 05:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
and asked for an opinion from the
 
05:08:55.510 --> 05:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
courts on that but this was not not to
 
05:08:57.430 --> 05:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
say we did not recognize that we really
 
05:08:59.430 --> 05:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
need to be able to help out these
 
05:09:00.948 --> 05:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
communities so it was felt that by
 
05:09:03.110 --> 05:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
putting this money into the fund that no
 
05:09:04.470 --> 05:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
matter what was happening those bills
 
05:09:06.470 --> 05:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
that we have kind of teed something
 
05:09:08.230 --> 05:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
something up so um
 
05:09:10.390 --> 05:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
i understand that uh there is an
 
05:09:12.550 --> 05:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
amendment from des to make a couple of
 
05:09:15.030 --> 05:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
corrections that were needed and some
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
technical correction or two um in what
 
05:09:19.750 --> 05:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
the senate had added so i i think that's
 
05:09:21.670 --> 05:09:21.680 align:start position:0%
pretty much where we're at mr chairman
 
05:09:24.868 --> 05:09:24.878 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you senator uh the question
 
05:09:27.430 --> 05:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
is that 25 million is that targeted for
 
05:09:30.070 --> 05:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
the pfas problem it's for the it's going
 
05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
into the pfas fund which we set up for
 
05:09:34.948 --> 05:09:34.958 align:start position:0%
these purposes thank you any other
 
05:09:36.628 --> 05:09:36.638 align:start position:0%
senators like to comment
 
05:09:38.390 --> 05:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
just like to ask a question because this
 
05:09:40.550 --> 05:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
isn't in my commerce or judiciary or
 
05:09:42.628 --> 05:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
other areas that i'm more familiar with
 
05:09:43.990 --> 05:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
were there any
 
05:09:46.470 --> 05:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
how many improperly designed systems
 
05:09:47.510 --> 05:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
were there
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
that this came to be a problem i know i
 
05:09:51.990 --> 05:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
read that it took a lot of time for the
 
05:09:54.150 --> 05:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
department to look into these things but
 
05:09:56.470 --> 05:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
did they actually have any actual cases
 
05:09:59.590 --> 05:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
and controversies of improperly designed
 
05:10:02.150 --> 05:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
septic systems that gave rise for the
 
05:10:04.150 --> 05:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
spill any of the representatives want to
 
05:10:06.628 --> 05:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
speak to that representative power
 
05:10:08.788 --> 05:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
05:10:12.150 --> 05:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
based on the the testimony in the house
 
05:10:15.030 --> 05:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
policy committee i am unaware of any
 
05:10:17.990 --> 05:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
improperly designed systems however it
 
05:10:20.948 --> 05:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
was stated that there
 
05:10:22.708 --> 05:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
are instances
 
05:10:25.430 --> 05:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
in which the applications and the specs
 
05:10:26.948 --> 05:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
are incomplete
 
05:10:28.868 --> 05:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
and it's lacking information so
 
05:10:31.750 --> 05:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
therefore the des needs to expend time
 
05:10:34.070 --> 05:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
and energy to
 
05:10:39.110 --> 05:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
the lacking information
 
05:10:44.628 --> 05:10:44.638 align:start position:0%
so what what we were told is um this
 
05:10:46.390 --> 05:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
occurs in 10
 
05:10:50.230 --> 05:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
instances approximately per year out of
 
05:10:52.390 --> 05:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
6 000 applicants
 
05:10:54.788 --> 05:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
um which is
 
05:10:57.350 --> 05:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
about 0.2 percent
 
05:11:00.868 --> 05:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:04.070 --> 05:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
very good that was quick committee
 
05:11:06.150 --> 05:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh anything to add from the from the
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:11.670 --> 05:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
05:11:14.390 --> 05:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
yes is it representative powell
 
05:11:16.470 --> 05:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
i had a question mr chair a procedural
 
05:11:19.270 --> 05:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
question so um
 
05:11:21.190 --> 05:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
right here in front of me i have two
 
05:11:21.200 --> 05:11:22.550 align:start position:0%
right here in front of me i have two
handouts

05:11:22.550 --> 05:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
handouts
 
05:11:22.560 --> 05:11:23.590 align:start position:0%
handouts
and

05:11:23.590 --> 05:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:11:25.830 --> 05:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's a side by side
 
05:11:29.110 --> 05:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
to house bill 1293
 
05:11:29.120 --> 05:11:35.190 align:start position:0%
to house bill 1293
and

05:11:35.190 --> 05:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:37.830 --> 05:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
one has more pages than the other and
 
05:11:40.070 --> 05:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
additionally i i researched this
 
05:11:42.390 --> 05:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
thoroughly this this weekend
 
05:11:46.390 --> 05:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:46.400 --> 05:11:48.948 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:11:48.948 --> 05:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:51.910 --> 05:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
so the information that i was able to um
 
05:11:53.990 --> 05:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
derive from the docket
 
05:11:54.000 --> 05:11:54.948 align:start position:0%
derive from the docket
um

05:11:54.948 --> 05:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:56.788 --> 05:11:56.798 align:start position:0%
is different from the information that's
 
05:11:57.990 --> 05:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
in front of me
 
05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:12:03.590 --> 05:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
i am not aware of a
 
05:12:03.600 --> 05:12:04.868 align:start position:0%
i am not aware of a
um

05:12:04.868 --> 05:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
a proportion of this amendment
 
05:12:08.948 --> 05:12:08.958 align:start position:0%
by the senate
 
05:12:12.310 --> 05:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
with regard to a pfas fund could some
 
05:12:15.350 --> 05:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
where where is this in in the amendment
 
05:12:16.868 --> 05:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
is is this
 
05:12:19.110 --> 05:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
is this part of the senate amendment or
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
is this something that the des i'm very
 
05:12:24.948 --> 05:12:24.958 align:start position:0%
confused uh if i if i may mr chairman um
 
05:12:26.788 --> 05:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bill as amended by
 
05:12:43.750 --> 05:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:21.030 --> 05:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:22.830 --> 05:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
i think we put that another
 
05:13:25.270 --> 05:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
bill i'm sorry
 
05:13:28.470 --> 05:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:28.480 --> 05:13:33.190 align:start position:0%
 
remember

05:13:33.190 --> 05:13:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:34.390 --> 05:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's another bill
 
05:13:36.310 --> 05:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
yes senator um
 
05:13:39.190 --> 05:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
in front okay in front of me i have um
 
05:13:41.910 --> 05:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment 1825 s
 
05:13:45.110 --> 05:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
and like i said i i spent a significant
 
05:13:45.120 --> 05:13:46.470 align:start position:0%
and like i said i i spent a significant
um

05:13:46.470 --> 05:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:49.590 --> 05:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
amount of time studying this and i
 
05:13:52.550 --> 05:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
am unaware of that provision my mistake
 
05:13:52.560 --> 05:13:53.350 align:start position:0%
am unaware of that provision my mistake
i

05:13:53.350 --> 05:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:13:54.948 --> 05:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
think that we decided at the last minute
 
05:13:57.030 --> 05:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
to put another in another bill and it is
 
05:13:58.470 --> 05:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
another bill and
 
05:14:10.708 --> 05:14:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:12.788 --> 05:14:12.798 align:start position:0%
any additional comments from the
 
05:14:14.708 --> 05:14:14.718 align:start position:0%
from the house side yes
 
05:14:16.868 --> 05:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
representative power so thank you mr
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%

05:14:21.830 --> 05:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
from my intense analysis of this
 
05:14:21.840 --> 05:14:23.110 align:start position:0%
from my intense analysis of this
amendment

05:14:23.110 --> 05:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:14:23.120 --> 05:14:24.788 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

05:14:24.788 --> 05:14:24.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:26.948 --> 05:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
i have a number of concerns with it
 
05:14:30.230 --> 05:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
additionally i spent
 
05:14:31.990 --> 05:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
about an hour and a half yesterday
 
05:14:34.070 --> 05:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
speaking with mr tardif from the
 
05:14:36.550 --> 05:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
department of environmental
 
05:14:36.560 --> 05:14:39.350 align:start position:0%
department of environmental
services

05:14:39.350 --> 05:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:42.230 --> 05:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
seeking to get my questions with regard
 
05:14:46.830 --> 05:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:46.840 --> 05:14:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
unfortunately

05:14:48.470 --> 05:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
05:14:50.550 --> 05:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
as a result of that conversation that
 
05:14:53.110 --> 05:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
there seemed to be more confusion um
 
05:14:55.430 --> 05:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
amongst both parties
 
05:14:58.390 --> 05:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:00.788 --> 05:15:00.798 align:start position:0%
of particular concern to me is the
 
05:15:03.190 --> 05:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
proposed changes in section three of the
 
05:15:05.110 --> 05:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that pertain to protective
 
05:15:07.190 --> 05:15:07.200 align:start position:0%
well radii
 
05:15:09.110 --> 05:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:15:10.628 --> 05:15:10.638 align:start position:0%
i also
 
05:15:13.110 --> 05:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
watched the hearing
 
05:15:18.310 --> 05:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
in the senate when this amendment was
 
05:15:20.150 --> 05:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
05:15:20.160 --> 05:15:21.510 align:start position:0%
brought up
and

05:15:21.510 --> 05:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:21.520 --> 05:15:22.390 align:start position:0%
and
no

05:15:22.390 --> 05:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:15:24.788 --> 05:15:24.798 align:start position:0%
no one from the senate committee
 
05:15:27.990 --> 05:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
asked about
 
05:15:29.670 --> 05:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
what happened to
 
05:15:29.680 --> 05:15:30.628 align:start position:0%
what happened to
section

05:15:30.628 --> 05:15:30.638 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:15:30.638 --> 05:15:31.990 align:start position:0%
section
um

05:15:31.990 --> 05:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:35.510 --> 05:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
a colon 30-b
 
05:15:37.510 --> 05:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
pertaining to cluster development that
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
is completely
 
05:15:41.990 --> 05:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
um eliminated from statute so that's
 
05:15:44.470 --> 05:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
that's i find that very concerning
 
05:15:46.628 --> 05:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
and furthermore the process
 
05:15:49.590 --> 05:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
by which this all came about
 
05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
i understand through my conversation
 
05:15:53.270 --> 05:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
with the des that
 
05:15:55.830 --> 05:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
these are important issues that need to
 
05:15:59.030 --> 05:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
be addressed through legislation
 
05:15:59.040 --> 05:16:01.110 align:start position:0%
be addressed through legislation
however

05:16:01.110 --> 05:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:16:02.868 --> 05:16:02.878 align:start position:0%
this was not
 
05:16:06.868 --> 05:16:06.878 align:start position:0%
heard in the house policy committee
 
05:16:06.878 --> 05:16:08.628 align:start position:0%
heard in the house policy committee
and

05:16:08.628 --> 05:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
to be clear while it has
 
05:16:13.750 --> 05:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
the words well and septic
 
05:16:16.070 --> 05:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
system in it
 
05:16:16.080 --> 05:16:17.110 align:start position:0%
system in it
it

05:16:17.110 --> 05:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:16:20.788 --> 05:16:20.798 align:start position:0%
is unrelated to the underlying bill
 
05:16:20.798 --> 05:16:21.670 align:start position:0%
is unrelated to the underlying bill
so

05:16:21.670 --> 05:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:16:21.680 --> 05:16:23.590 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:16:23.590 --> 05:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:27.430 --> 05:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not very uncomfortable with um
 
05:16:30.390 --> 05:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
the content of this amendment
 
05:16:30.400 --> 05:16:32.788 align:start position:0%
the content of this amendment
um

05:16:32.788 --> 05:16:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:36.470 --> 05:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
senate colleagues do you have any
 
05:16:41.110 --> 05:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
further discussion you want to add to
 
05:16:41.120 --> 05:16:43.030 align:start position:0%
further discussion you want to add to
that

05:16:43.030 --> 05:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:16:43.040 --> 05:16:43.830 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:16:43.830 --> 05:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:45.910 --> 05:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of the
 
05:16:47.990 --> 05:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
provision a and b i think we might get
 
05:16:50.150 --> 05:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
some clarification from uh
 
05:16:51.910 --> 05:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
mr tardive
 
05:16:53.910 --> 05:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of um the amendment in the
 
05:16:55.990 --> 05:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
senate uh this is
 
05:16:58.550 --> 05:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
what both bodies do is we amend bills
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
from the other body
 
05:17:01.750 --> 05:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:17:03.990 --> 05:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
that that's why we have committees of
 
05:17:04.000 --> 05:17:05.670 align:start position:0%
that that's why we have committees of
conference

05:17:05.670 --> 05:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
conference
 
05:17:05.680 --> 05:17:06.390 align:start position:0%
conference
but

05:17:06.390 --> 05:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:17:08.150 --> 05:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know it is germaine to the bill
 
05:17:10.948 --> 05:17:10.958 align:start position:0%
because it is now in the in the building
 
05:17:13.750 --> 05:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
um so that's not unusual for both bodies
 
05:17:15.110 --> 05:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
05:17:17.190 --> 05:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
um constantly so
 
05:17:19.430 --> 05:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
05:17:21.830 --> 05:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of the procedural aspects
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
that's just the way things are for both
 
05:17:24.240 --> 05:17:27.910 align:start position:0%
that's just the way things are for both
bodies

05:17:27.910 --> 05:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:29.430 --> 05:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
05:17:31.030 --> 05:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
i i
 
05:17:33.430 --> 05:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
if i may i i understand
 
05:17:36.230 --> 05:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
and my colleagues can help correct me if
 
05:17:38.390 --> 05:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'm wrong the conversations we've had
 
05:17:40.550 --> 05:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
with des
 
05:17:43.030 --> 05:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
drive us to
 
05:17:45.830 --> 05:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
a preliminary conclusion that this bill
 
05:17:48.070 --> 05:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
as amended is not ready for prime time
 
05:17:50.470 --> 05:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
it needs a lot more work done to it
 
05:17:50.480 --> 05:17:52.230 align:start position:0%
it needs a lot more work done to it
and

05:17:52.230 --> 05:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:17:53.670 --> 05:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
and we really
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
05:17:57.030 --> 05:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't have those amendments
 
05:17:59.270 --> 05:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
that might need to be done
 
05:18:01.350 --> 05:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
will need to be considered and then
 
05:18:03.430 --> 05:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
and then put forth
 
05:18:05.910 --> 05:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
that this bill might
 
05:18:05.920 --> 05:18:07.110 align:start position:0%
that this bill might
be

05:18:07.110 --> 05:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
better received
 
05:18:10.390 --> 05:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
after it goes through some additional
 
05:18:12.628 --> 05:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
work by des
 
05:18:14.788 --> 05:18:14.798 align:start position:0%
yes senator
 
05:18:16.390 --> 05:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
there's an old saying you don't make the
 
05:18:20.230 --> 05:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:22.230 --> 05:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is needed
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
while we're sitting here pfas is leaking
 
05:18:27.510 --> 05:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
into wells and expanding its footprint
 
05:18:29.270 --> 05:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to put money into a
 
05:18:31.350 --> 05:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
fund to start addressing that
 
05:18:33.030 --> 05:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
people die
 
05:18:35.110 --> 05:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
from pfas and other similar things when
 
05:18:36.948 --> 05:18:36.958 align:start position:0%
you try to make the perfect the enemy of
 
05:18:38.948 --> 05:18:38.958 align:start position:0%
the good we wind up not being effective
 
05:18:40.868 --> 05:18:40.878 align:start position:0%
as a legislature
 
05:18:43.030 --> 05:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
so i would submit that we pass this and
 
05:18:44.868 --> 05:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
you repair anything in it next year
 
05:18:46.788 --> 05:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
because very few pieces of legislation
 
05:18:48.310 --> 05:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
are ever passed
 
05:18:50.390 --> 05:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
that don't require further modification
 
05:18:54.230 --> 05:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
as circumstances uh and issues develop
 
05:18:55.910 --> 05:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
down the road
 
05:18:59.110 --> 05:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
could you senator could you direct me to
 
05:19:01.350 --> 05:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
the where in the amendment it talks
 
05:19:04.550 --> 05:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:06.150 --> 05:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
but the fund isn't in here that was my
 
05:19:06.160 --> 05:19:07.190 align:start position:0%
but the fund isn't in here that was my
mistake

05:19:07.190 --> 05:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
05:19:10.390 --> 05:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
your point about potential pollution
 
05:19:12.708 --> 05:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
um and this having needing to deal with
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
this radii
 
05:19:16.550 --> 05:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
issue because of people's property
 
05:19:16.560 --> 05:19:17.830 align:start position:0%
issue because of people's property
rights

05:19:17.830 --> 05:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
rights
 
05:19:21.190 --> 05:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
is significant so
 
05:19:23.030 --> 05:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of the technical question about
 
05:19:24.550 --> 05:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
parts a and b i think that's been
 
05:19:25.830 --> 05:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
answered i thought one of you had an
 
05:19:28.948 --> 05:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
amendment that was being drafted by oos
 
05:19:31.110 --> 05:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
um is that the case
 
05:19:34.868 --> 05:19:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:34.878 --> 05:19:36.628 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:19:36.628 --> 05:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:19:39.830 --> 05:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah if you if you want mr chairman but
 
05:19:41.670 --> 05:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh please come up and introduce yourself
 
05:19:53.910 --> 05:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:56.070 --> 05:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon my name is
 
05:19:57.750 --> 05:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
phillip trobridge i'm the manager of the
 
05:20:00.948 --> 05:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
land resource programs at des
 
05:20:03.190 --> 05:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
i'm rob tardif i'm the
 
05:20:04.868 --> 05:20:04.878 align:start position:0%
administrator of the subsurface systems
 
05:20:07.670 --> 05:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
bureau at des
 
05:20:13.990 --> 05:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:17.350 --> 05:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
i've spoken with a few of you folks uh
 
05:20:18.868 --> 05:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
throughout the past few days on these
 
05:20:18.878 --> 05:20:20.070 align:start position:0%
throughout the past few days on these
amendments

05:20:20.070 --> 05:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
05:20:22.628 --> 05:20:22.638 align:start position:0%
uh the first amendment well
 
05:20:25.430 --> 05:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill as representative
 
05:20:28.788 --> 05:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
power pointed out is relative to
 
05:20:31.190 --> 05:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh homeowner designs
 
05:20:32.788 --> 05:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
for their domicile
 
05:20:34.548 --> 05:20:34.558 align:start position:0%
that passed the both house and the
 
05:20:36.548 --> 05:20:36.558 align:start position:0%
senate unanimously so
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to speak more to that but i
 
05:20:40.948 --> 05:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
think the questions really are regarding
 
05:20:42.548 --> 05:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
the two amendments
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
uh the first amendment being to 45 a 30
 
05:20:49.510 --> 05:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
a and 30 b
 
05:20:51.110 --> 05:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
30 b is
 
05:20:53.270 --> 05:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me 30b is really the meat of what
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
05:20:57.590 --> 05:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
and what we what we ended up trying to
 
05:20:59.590 --> 05:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
do is to clarify
 
05:20:59.600 --> 05:21:00.708 align:start position:0%
do is to clarify
30b

05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
30b
 
05:21:03.430 --> 05:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh and in the process
 
05:21:04.788 --> 05:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
we went
 
05:21:06.310 --> 05:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
through the attorney general's office
 
05:21:07.670 --> 05:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general's office
 
05:21:09.430 --> 05:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
determined that the language in third
 
05:21:11.910 --> 05:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
the existing language in 30b
 
05:21:14.070 --> 05:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
was such that it should be completely
 
05:21:15.670 --> 05:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
rewritten to accomplish the
 
05:21:17.190 --> 05:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
clarifications that we're trying to
 
05:21:17.200 --> 05:21:19.110 align:start position:0%
clarifications that we're trying to
accomplish

05:21:19.110 --> 05:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
05:21:21.590 --> 05:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
so in those amendments
 
05:21:21.600 --> 05:21:22.788 align:start position:0%
so in those amendments
um

05:21:22.788 --> 05:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:24.788 --> 05:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
again the the entire language was
 
05:21:27.510 --> 05:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
rewritten uh some of the
 
05:21:29.190 --> 05:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
clarifications and
 
05:21:31.590 --> 05:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
changes that were made were regarding
 
05:21:33.670 --> 05:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
different scenarios when it comes to
 
05:21:35.430 --> 05:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
installation of drinking water private
 
05:21:37.670 --> 05:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
drinking water wells
 
05:21:39.910 --> 05:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
in septic systems
 
05:21:41.670 --> 05:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
for instance if a septic system is
 
05:21:43.990 --> 05:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
installed concurrently or if a well is
 
05:21:45.750 --> 05:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
installed concurrently with a septic
 
05:21:49.430 --> 05:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
system then certain things
 
05:21:51.270 --> 05:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
would come into play if a well is
 
05:21:51.280 --> 05:21:54.628 align:start position:0%
would come into play if a well is
installed

05:21:54.628 --> 05:21:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
without being relative to the
 
05:21:58.150 --> 05:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
installation of a septic system then
 
05:22:01.270 --> 05:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
other conditions would come into play we
 
05:22:03.750 --> 05:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
tried to and i could i'd be happy to get
 
05:22:05.590 --> 05:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
into those details i'm trying to stay
 
05:22:08.548 --> 05:22:08.558 align:start position:0%
somewhat general
 
05:22:10.548 --> 05:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
the other part of the clarification of
 
05:22:13.430 --> 05:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
38 and 30 b is to
 
05:22:15.430 --> 05:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
essentially level the playing field
 
05:22:18.628 --> 05:22:18.638 align:start position:0%
relative to wells installed
 
05:22:21.430 --> 05:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
prior to 1989 and wells installed
 
05:22:23.110 --> 05:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
subsequent uh
 
05:22:25.030 --> 05:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
after 1989.
 
05:22:28.070 --> 05:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh in 1989 well
 
05:22:31.430 --> 05:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
in 1991 there was some legislation or a
 
05:22:33.110 --> 05:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
supreme court hearing
 
05:22:33.120 --> 05:22:34.150 align:start position:0%
supreme court hearing
uh

05:22:34.150 --> 05:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:22:35.670 --> 05:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
regarding a spite well that was
 
05:22:38.150 --> 05:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
installed that encumbered uh an
 
05:22:39.750 --> 05:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
undeveloped lot
 
05:22:42.150 --> 05:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh the supreme court decided that the
 
05:22:44.948 --> 05:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
protective well radius that was going
 
05:22:44.958 --> 05:22:46.310 align:start position:0%
protective well radius that was going
over

05:22:46.310 --> 05:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:22:48.230 --> 05:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
the well owner's property onto the
 
05:22:50.070 --> 05:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
budding property
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
could not encumber
 
05:22:54.708 --> 05:22:54.718 align:start position:0%
that that there or the rights of
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
the adjacent lot to be developed
 
05:22:57.600 --> 05:22:58.628 align:start position:0%
the adjacent lot to be developed
so

05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:23:01.670 --> 05:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:05.670 --> 05:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
that eddie well drilled after 1989
 
05:23:08.230 --> 05:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
the protective well radius on the
 
05:23:11.190 --> 05:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
abutting lots would be forfeited
 
05:23:13.270 --> 05:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
what the other part of this bill is to
 
05:23:15.030 --> 05:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
try to level that playing field such
 
05:23:19.270 --> 05:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
that wells drilled prior to 1989 uh also
 
05:23:21.990 --> 05:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't encumber adjacent lots let me
 
05:23:24.070 --> 05:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
let me uh jump in for a minute uh i
 
05:23:26.708 --> 05:23:26.718 align:start position:0%
asked my senate colleagues what i'm
 
05:23:30.390 --> 05:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
looking at is uh is an amendment 18
 
05:23:32.788 --> 05:23:32.798 align:start position:0%
25 s is that
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
is that the one that
 
05:23:37.190 --> 05:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
you guys have
 
05:23:38.948 --> 05:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
but it's not yet incorporated is that
 
05:23:38.958 --> 05:23:51.430 align:start position:0%
but it's not yet incorporated is that
right

05:23:51.430 --> 05:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:54.150 --> 05:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
1825 s i believe is on the docket on the
 
05:23:57.350 --> 05:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
website as you and i spoke yesterday
 
05:23:59.990 --> 05:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
there has since been
 
05:24:02.548 --> 05:24:02.558 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
05:24:02.558 --> 05:24:06.948 align:start position:0%
an amendment
2022-2004-h

05:24:06.948 --> 05:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:08.788 --> 05:24:08.798 align:start position:0%
uh and in fact
 
05:24:11.750 --> 05:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
i was speaking with
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
a matthew young at ols to further
 
05:24:14.638 --> 05:24:16.070 align:start position:0%
a matthew young at ols to further
clarify

05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
uh and we're hoping that that additional
 
05:24:21.510 --> 05:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
clarification which would include
 
05:24:24.628 --> 05:24:24.638 align:start position:0%
representative powers concerns about
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh the cluster subdivision
 
05:24:29.350 --> 05:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
provisions that are currently in 45 a 30
 
05:24:29.360 --> 05:24:30.390 align:start position:0%
provisions that are currently in 45 a 30
b

05:24:30.390 --> 05:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
b
 
05:24:31.708 --> 05:24:31.718 align:start position:0%
uh be
 
05:24:34.548 --> 05:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
reinstated into this amendment we're
 
05:24:36.948 --> 05:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
hoping to get that language here
 
05:24:39.270 --> 05:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh what what we're proposing to do and
 
05:24:41.030 --> 05:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
and to to the point you were making
 
05:24:42.548 --> 05:24:42.558 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
05:24:44.788 --> 05:24:44.798 align:start position:0%
uh it was determined that that language
 
05:24:46.310 --> 05:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
should have stayed
 
05:24:47.670 --> 05:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
in the statute
 
05:24:50.390 --> 05:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh so we're now proposing to keep that
 
05:24:53.190 --> 05:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
language in the statute so where is that
 
05:24:54.708 --> 05:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
language right now
 
05:24:54.718 --> 05:24:55.990 align:start position:0%
language right now
again

05:24:55.990 --> 05:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:24:58.390 --> 05:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
earlier this afternoon
 
05:24:58.400 --> 05:24:59.670 align:start position:0%
earlier this afternoon
yes

05:24:59.670 --> 05:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:25:03.590 --> 05:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to get it here by this time
 
05:25:05.510 --> 05:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
through representative mcconkey i spoke
 
05:25:07.110 --> 05:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
with representative mcconkey this
 
05:25:08.708 --> 05:25:08.718 align:start position:0%
morning well
 
05:25:10.150 --> 05:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
around noon
 
05:25:12.390 --> 05:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh and again timing has
 
05:25:13.990 --> 05:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
been a
 
05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
real time crunch to try and get this all
 
05:25:17.510 --> 05:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
done i think i think it goes without
 
05:25:19.430 --> 05:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
saying that it's it's difficult for us
 
05:25:21.110 --> 05:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
to consider an amendment that we don't
 
05:25:23.190 --> 05:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
have i understand
 
05:25:24.948 --> 05:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
ms johnson mr chairman i thought we i
 
05:25:26.470 --> 05:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
thought that that was here and that's
 
05:25:28.708 --> 05:25:28.718 align:start position:0%
why i have my some of my confusion so
 
05:25:32.070 --> 05:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
yes representatives
 
05:25:35.750 --> 05:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to just to be 100 sure 2 0 0 4
 
05:25:35.760 --> 05:25:36.948 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to just to be 100 sure 2 0 0 4
h

05:25:36.948 --> 05:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
h
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
is not the latest amendment we're
 
05:25:39.990 --> 05:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
waiting for one more
 
05:25:41.190 --> 05:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
waiting for one more waiting for one
 
05:25:42.310 --> 05:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
more okay that's what i just wanted to
 
05:25:43.990 --> 05:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
be sure of shuffle on paper thank you
 
05:25:45.910 --> 05:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative power you had a comment
 
05:25:47.590 --> 05:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
no two zero zero four h is what we're
 
05:25:48.628 --> 05:25:48.638 align:start position:0%
waiting for
 
05:25:49.830 --> 05:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
i have that
 
05:25:52.390 --> 05:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
zero zero four eight it wasn't and as i
 
05:25:54.470 --> 05:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
under if i can
 
05:25:54.480 --> 05:25:55.350 align:start position:0%
under if i can
sorry

05:25:55.350 --> 05:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
05:25:57.110 --> 05:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh if i can
 
05:25:59.830 --> 05:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
at least describe as i understand it uh
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
the reason that this 2004 h has not been
 
05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
seen on the docket yet is because it
 
05:26:07.430 --> 05:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't approved by a committee
 
05:26:09.590 --> 05:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
so it's not public information so
 
05:26:11.590 --> 05:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
therefore it's not on the website so
 
05:26:14.868 --> 05:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
it's preliminary at this point yeah uh
 
05:26:17.030 --> 05:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes i was under the understanding that
 
05:26:19.350 --> 05:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
the committee would have had copies of
 
05:26:22.390 --> 05:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
at least this 2004-h because i received
 
05:26:24.708 --> 05:26:24.718 align:start position:0%
it through email
 
05:26:24.718 --> 05:26:26.788 align:start position:0%
it through email
representative

05:26:26.788 --> 05:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:26:29.830 --> 05:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair i'm very concerned with the
 
05:26:31.990 --> 05:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
process and what's going on there seems
 
05:26:34.868 --> 05:26:34.878 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of confusion with regards to
 
05:26:37.190 --> 05:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
what exactly we're talking about what's
 
05:26:38.708 --> 05:26:38.718 align:start position:0%
in the amendment what's not in the
 
05:26:41.270 --> 05:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
amendment what amendment's coming what
 
05:26:42.948 --> 05:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
amendment isn't here
 
05:26:42.958 --> 05:26:44.310 align:start position:0%
amendment isn't here
i'm

05:26:44.310 --> 05:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
05:26:45.120 --> 05:26:45.130 align:start position:0%
i'm very
 
05:26:45.130 --> 05:26:46.470 align:start position:0%
i'm very
[Music]

05:26:46.470 --> 05:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:26:49.350 --> 05:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
concerned and very frustrated
 
05:26:49.360 --> 05:26:51.590 align:start position:0%
concerned and very frustrated
if

05:26:51.590 --> 05:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:53.510 --> 05:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
if this is something
 
05:26:55.830 --> 05:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
that that needs to be addressed then i
 
05:26:57.910 --> 05:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
would recommend
 
05:27:00.390 --> 05:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
that this senate amendment
 
05:27:02.948 --> 05:27:02.958 align:start position:0%
be filed as an lsr
 
05:27:05.030 --> 05:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
and it go through the proper procedure
 
05:27:07.030 --> 05:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
it goes through the senate and and then
 
05:27:08.788 --> 05:27:08.798 align:start position:0%
the house or if somebody from the house
 
05:27:10.868 --> 05:27:10.878 align:start position:0%
wants to file it it goes through the
 
05:27:13.590 --> 05:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
house and then the senate
 
05:27:16.470 --> 05:27:16.480 align:start position:0%
i i am very uncomfortable with these
 
05:27:19.350 --> 05:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
types of substantive changes being done
 
05:27:21.590 --> 05:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the senate and then dealt with them
 
05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the committee of conference by
 
05:27:26.868 --> 05:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
a small number of legislators
 
05:27:29.110 --> 05:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
this was not heard in the house
 
05:27:30.708 --> 05:27:30.718 align:start position:0%
the this
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
the content of the amendment was not
 
05:27:34.470 --> 05:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
heard in the house by the house policy
 
05:27:36.788 --> 05:27:36.798 align:start position:0%
committee i'm very uncomfortable
 
05:27:39.910 --> 05:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative piamonte
 
05:27:42.310 --> 05:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i agree with uh
 
05:27:44.070 --> 05:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative powell
 
05:27:45.750 --> 05:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh this uh uh
 
05:27:48.150 --> 05:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
i would prefer just to drop all the
 
05:27:50.230 --> 05:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
amendments and uh take the house
 
05:27:53.830 --> 05:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
position on 1293 has ought to pass
 
05:27:57.990 --> 05:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:01.270 --> 05:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative i i was i've had
 
05:28:03.830 --> 05:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
conversations with mr tardiff yesterday
 
05:28:03.840 --> 05:28:04.708 align:start position:0%
conversations with mr tardiff yesterday
i

05:28:04.708 --> 05:28:04.718 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:28:06.310 --> 05:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
geeked out a little bit i told him that
 
05:28:07.990 --> 05:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
admitted that being on a planning board
 
05:28:09.910 --> 05:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
for 12 15 years however long i've been
 
05:28:11.510 --> 05:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
on it i understood where we were going
 
05:28:13.430 --> 05:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
here and the importance of it i
 
05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
certainly respect what i'm hearing from
 
05:28:18.948 --> 05:28:18.958 align:start position:0%
my colleagues here also and to that end
 
05:28:21.350 --> 05:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
i think the underlying bill that we were
 
05:28:23.430 --> 05:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
talking about roughly designing a system
 
05:28:25.750 --> 05:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
for your own domicile is important
 
05:28:27.190 --> 05:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
even for the reasons that we've got
 
05:28:29.750 --> 05:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
stuff leaking into the you know do we if
 
05:28:32.230 --> 05:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's only 10 it's only 10 but that's 10
 
05:28:32.240 --> 05:28:33.430 align:start position:0%
it's only 10 it's only 10 but that's 10
leaking

05:28:33.430 --> 05:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
leaking
 
05:28:35.590 --> 05:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
if we could get at least that past we
 
05:28:37.510 --> 05:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
would have done something and and i
 
05:28:39.510 --> 05:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
would i would hope maybe we can at least
 
05:28:41.750 --> 05:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
do that much and then try to try to
 
05:28:44.230 --> 05:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
relieve the confusion about the other
 
05:28:45.910 --> 05:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
things and be comfortable about that in
 
05:28:48.230 --> 05:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
a separate bill so i'm agreeing with
 
05:28:50.948 --> 05:28:50.958 align:start position:0%
representative piemonte there to uh
 
05:28:52.948 --> 05:28:52.958 align:start position:0%
uh if that gets us to move along and
 
05:28:54.470 --> 05:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to voice that thank you tara if
 
05:28:55.750 --> 05:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
you hear anything you wanted to add to
 
05:28:55.760 --> 05:28:57.350 align:start position:0%
you hear anything you wanted to add to
that

05:28:57.350 --> 05:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:28:58.708 --> 05:28:58.718 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
05:29:00.548 --> 05:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
there was another portion of the bill
 
05:29:03.190 --> 05:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
that is uh it's
 
05:29:04.868 --> 05:29:04.878 align:start position:0%
relative to the subsurface systems
 
05:29:08.070 --> 05:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
bureau approval process that's
 
05:29:10.868 --> 05:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
equally important to us would that be an
 
05:29:12.948 --> 05:29:12.958 align:start position:0%
additional amendment it's included in
 
05:29:15.030 --> 05:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment okay
 
05:29:17.670 --> 05:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
and what that is is it's relative to our
 
05:29:20.070 --> 05:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
time frames and our ability to request
 
05:29:22.310 --> 05:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
additional information from applications
 
05:29:25.190 --> 05:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
that come in that are not uh complete or
 
05:29:26.868 --> 05:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
there are lacking
 
05:29:28.948 --> 05:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
all the information we need
 
05:29:31.830 --> 05:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
the way 45 8 31 is currently written it
 
05:29:34.230 --> 05:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
says that within a certain time frame
 
05:29:36.390 --> 05:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
depending on the type of application we
 
05:29:39.350 --> 05:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
shall approve or disapprove
 
05:29:39.360 --> 05:29:40.548 align:start position:0%
shall approve or disapprove
the

05:29:40.548 --> 05:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:29:40.558 --> 05:29:41.990 align:start position:0%
the
proposal

05:29:41.990 --> 05:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
05:29:44.070 --> 05:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
if we don't do that within certain time
 
05:29:46.470 --> 05:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
frames then the by law the the
 
05:29:49.350 --> 05:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
applications are deemed approved
 
05:29:51.990 --> 05:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
the department is always
 
05:29:55.910 --> 05:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
interpreted disapproved as
 
05:29:58.230 --> 05:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
not necessarily approved certainly but
 
05:30:00.548 --> 05:30:00.558 align:start position:0%
not necessarily denied either and again
 
05:30:02.708 --> 05:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
we we would put out a request as we call
 
05:30:04.470 --> 05:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
it a request for more information it's a
 
05:30:07.030 --> 05:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
letter sent to the applicant let me ask
 
05:30:08.310 --> 05:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
you something and i don't want to get
 
05:30:10.470 --> 05:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
you in trouble with uh that's okay the
 
05:30:13.030 --> 05:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
commission or with uh with my senate
 
05:30:14.868 --> 05:30:14.878 align:start position:0%
colleagues but
 
05:30:17.510 --> 05:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
with with all these changes happening
 
05:30:20.548 --> 05:30:20.558 align:start position:0%
in a matter of uh now a matter of days
 
05:30:22.390 --> 05:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable
 
05:30:23.670 --> 05:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:30:25.830 --> 05:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
with the amount of time that your staff
 
05:30:28.390 --> 05:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
has had to re research and understand
 
05:30:29.590 --> 05:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
this and
 
05:30:32.628 --> 05:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
recommend to to the legislature what
 
05:30:34.788 --> 05:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
ought to happen or would you like more
 
05:30:34.798 --> 05:30:35.990 align:start position:0%
ought to happen or would you like more
time

05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:30:37.910 --> 05:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh i think
 
05:30:40.070 --> 05:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
well i fully appreciate and agree that
 
05:30:42.548 --> 05:30:42.558 align:start position:0%
it's been quite a crunch to try to get
 
05:30:44.390 --> 05:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
all this information to
 
05:30:46.470 --> 05:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
you folks um
 
05:30:48.230 --> 05:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
05:30:49.190 --> 05:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
up to
 
05:30:51.110 --> 05:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
my conversations with matt young today
 
05:30:53.270 --> 05:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
in ols i think that what's being
 
05:30:55.510 --> 05:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
proposed and i fully appreciate the fact
 
05:30:56.628 --> 05:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
that you haven't seen it yet
 
05:30:56.638 --> 05:30:57.990 align:start position:0%
that you haven't seen it yet
unfortunately

05:30:57.990 --> 05:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
05:30:59.590 --> 05:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's a pretty complete
 
05:30:59.600 --> 05:31:00.948 align:start position:0%
uh i think it's a pretty complete
package

05:31:00.948 --> 05:31:00.958 align:start position:0%
package
 
05:31:00.958 --> 05:31:01.830 align:start position:0%
package
um

05:31:01.830 --> 05:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:01.840 --> 05:31:02.548 align:start position:0%
um
what

05:31:02.548 --> 05:31:02.558 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:31:05.670 --> 05:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
relative to the process uh the amendment
 
05:31:09.270 --> 05:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:11.350 --> 05:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
well there was a minor tweak to that
 
05:31:13.830 --> 05:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
because the language that we proposed
 
05:31:16.470 --> 05:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
not all of the language was included
 
05:31:16.480 --> 05:31:18.868 align:start position:0%
not all of the language was included
in

05:31:18.868 --> 05:31:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:20.708 --> 05:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
this 22
 
05:31:23.110 --> 05:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
2004 h
 
05:31:24.628 --> 05:31:24.638 align:start position:0%
that again we were under the impression
 
05:31:28.548 --> 05:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:31.270 --> 05:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
so it would would it be your contention
 
05:31:32.230 --> 05:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:31:32.240 --> 05:31:33.350 align:start position:0%
that the
20

05:31:33.350 --> 05:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
20
 
05:31:36.548 --> 05:31:36.558 align:start position:0%
0 0 4h needs a further amendment or
 
05:31:38.150 --> 05:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be adjusted
 
05:31:40.150 --> 05:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
it's slightly again that the the
 
05:31:42.788 --> 05:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
language that we suggested in a word
 
05:31:45.110 --> 05:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
document that we submitted or was
 
05:31:46.310 --> 05:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
submitted through
 
05:31:47.990 --> 05:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkey
 
05:31:50.150 --> 05:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
it seemed as though some of the things
 
05:31:52.708 --> 05:31:52.718 align:start position:0%
in that were not included
 
05:31:54.708 --> 05:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
and it's just one does that mean that
 
05:31:56.390 --> 05:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
that it's pending or does that mean
 
05:31:57.910 --> 05:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
someone has a homework assignment
 
05:32:01.030 --> 05:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
tonight so late in the evening
 
05:32:03.110 --> 05:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
i would i was hoping that it would be on
 
05:32:05.350 --> 05:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
your desks for this meeting so i i don't
 
05:32:07.110 --> 05:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
know if it's even a homework assignment
 
05:32:07.120 --> 05:32:08.230 align:start position:0%
know if it's even a homework assignment
today

05:32:08.230 --> 05:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:32:12.070 --> 05:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
yes senator uh thank you mr chairman
 
05:32:14.948 --> 05:32:14.958 align:start position:0%
so um just to clarify what you're
 
05:32:17.430 --> 05:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
talking about the rulemaking that is on
 
05:32:19.110 --> 05:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended by the senate that's
 
05:32:21.670 --> 05:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
page three
 
05:32:25.990 --> 05:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:29.990 --> 05:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:31.670 --> 05:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
well um
 
05:32:33.350 --> 05:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
as amended by the senate i think it's
 
05:32:36.070 --> 05:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
signed 24.
 
05:32:37.590 --> 05:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
if you'll take a look i just wanted to
 
05:32:39.350 --> 05:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
ask that because then i have a question
 
05:32:41.270 --> 05:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
for you mr chairman perhaps the way i
 
05:32:43.670 --> 05:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
think about it is it's uh section
 
05:32:43.680 --> 05:32:44.708 align:start position:0%
think about it is it's uh section
five

05:32:44.708 --> 05:32:44.718 align:start position:0%
five
 
05:32:44.718 --> 05:32:45.670 align:start position:0%
five
pardon

05:32:45.670 --> 05:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
pardon
 
05:32:49.030 --> 05:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's the uh number five of the amendment
 
05:32:52.070 --> 05:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay so nothing okay starting on line 34
 
05:32:57.430 --> 05:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:59.670 --> 05:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay see the version we have
 
05:33:01.990 --> 05:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
as it's starting on 29 but
 
05:33:02.000 --> 05:33:03.030 align:start position:0%
as it's starting on 29 but
yeah

05:33:03.030 --> 05:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:33:10.390 --> 05:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:12.070 --> 05:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so representative powers asked you
 
05:33:24.788 --> 05:33:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:27.030 --> 05:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
i had a conversation with mr tardif
 
05:33:29.750 --> 05:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday where i pointed out to him
 
05:33:31.750 --> 05:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
that cluster development had been
 
05:33:33.990 --> 05:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
dropped by the attorney general's office
 
05:33:36.470 --> 05:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
the attorney that drafted this amendment
 
05:33:39.670 --> 05:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
language had i not had that conversation
 
05:33:41.750 --> 05:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
and brought it to his attention it
 
05:33:43.350 --> 05:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
05:33:44.470 --> 05:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
05:33:44.480 --> 05:33:45.670 align:start position:0%
i guess
being

05:33:45.670 --> 05:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:33:47.910 --> 05:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
replaced and put back into some
 
05:33:51.350 --> 05:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
amendment which we don't yet have so my
 
05:33:52.470 --> 05:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
question is
 
05:33:54.150 --> 05:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
what else
 
05:33:56.310 --> 05:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
in this amendment which we don't yet
 
05:33:59.270 --> 05:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
have what else is is missing what what
 
05:34:01.750 --> 05:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
what else is may have unintended
 
05:34:01.760 --> 05:34:04.628 align:start position:0%
what else is may have unintended
consequences

05:34:04.628 --> 05:34:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:07.990 --> 05:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
we as i'm sorry we as legislators need
 
05:34:11.030 --> 05:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
to take a careful review and look at
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
this language that is our job
 
05:34:17.350 --> 05:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
and i will repeat yet once again i am
 
05:34:19.110 --> 05:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
very uncomfortable
 
05:34:21.750 --> 05:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
with the manner in which
 
05:34:24.628 --> 05:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
these proposed changes are
 
05:34:26.390 --> 05:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
are being done
 
05:34:28.788 --> 05:34:28.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's unacceptable to me
 
05:34:30.390 --> 05:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
i would
 
05:34:33.190 --> 05:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
i don't disagree that that perhaps this
 
05:34:35.670 --> 05:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
this needs to be addressed but let's do
 
05:34:37.270 --> 05:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
it correctly
 
05:34:39.270 --> 05:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
we need to do this right
 
05:34:40.390 --> 05:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
05:34:42.708 --> 05:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
so um thank you mr chairman i i
 
05:34:44.310 --> 05:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
understand what the representative's
 
05:34:46.070 --> 05:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
saying and i think that's caution is
 
05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
always good
 
05:34:48.948 --> 05:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
it seems to me
 
05:34:50.230 --> 05:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
that what is
 
05:34:52.470 --> 05:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
relatively simple here is that part
 
05:34:54.070 --> 05:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
about the
 
05:34:55.590 --> 05:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bill as amended by
 
05:34:57.510 --> 05:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
05:35:00.708 --> 05:35:00.718 align:start position:0%
that version page three
 
05:35:03.110 --> 05:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
dotted lines 34.
 
05:35:08.150 --> 05:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:09.750 --> 05:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
through sections
 
05:35:09.760 --> 05:35:15.030 align:start position:0%
through sections
six

05:35:15.030 --> 05:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:15.040 --> 05:35:16.230 align:start position:0%
 
now

05:35:16.230 --> 05:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:35:19.110 --> 05:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
this is as we heard
 
05:35:23.110 --> 05:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
from des is is some necessary
 
05:35:26.708 --> 05:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
procedural clarifications
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
the 30 days the 15 days the additional
 
05:35:31.110 --> 05:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
information you know we do this about a
 
05:35:32.470 --> 05:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
lot of things it's good to have that
 
05:35:32.480 --> 05:35:34.230 align:start position:0%
lot of things it's good to have that
clarified

05:35:34.230 --> 05:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
clarified
 
05:35:35.750 --> 05:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that doesn't run
 
05:35:37.190 --> 05:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
into the problems that the
 
05:35:39.750 --> 05:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative is raising about
 
05:35:41.990 --> 05:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know time to cook it
 
05:35:43.910 --> 05:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and i would think that maybe what we
 
05:35:46.628 --> 05:35:46.638 align:start position:0%
could do is take the underlying bill
 
05:35:49.190 --> 05:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
and this section forget the rest of it
 
05:35:52.310 --> 05:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
for now because that obviously
 
05:35:54.390 --> 05:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
is causing some discomfort
 
05:35:57.910 --> 05:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:59.430 --> 05:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
and that might be a way for us to
 
05:36:01.750 --> 05:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
proceed so can you describe that to me
 
05:36:03.670 --> 05:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
again slowly yeah sure so we'd have the
 
05:36:06.390 --> 05:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
05:36:06.400 --> 05:36:09.030 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
portion

05:36:09.030 --> 05:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
right right and then we'd have starting
 
05:36:14.948 --> 05:36:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:16.548 --> 05:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
on line 34
 
05:36:18.310 --> 05:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
the bill the version as amended by the
 
05:36:18.320 --> 05:36:20.310 align:start position:0%
the bill the version as amended by the
senate

05:36:20.310 --> 05:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
senate
 
05:36:21.830 --> 05:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
so on page
 
05:36:24.788 --> 05:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
three hb 293 as amended by the senate on
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
page three starting at lines
 
05:36:27.600 --> 05:36:29.350 align:start position:0%
page three starting at lines
34

05:36:29.350 --> 05:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
34
 
05:36:32.070 --> 05:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
and then going online
 
05:36:34.948 --> 05:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
on page 4 through line 22
 
05:36:37.510 --> 05:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
so that sections 5 and 6.
 
05:36:39.670 --> 05:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
so those two sections which are just the
 
05:36:43.190 --> 05:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
kind of procedural about the fifth the
 
05:36:45.510 --> 05:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
additional information time period for
 
05:36:48.470 --> 05:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
review the 30 days and the 15 days so
 
05:36:50.548 --> 05:36:50.558 align:start position:0%
that people have that
 
05:36:52.390 --> 05:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
clarification and guarantee that things
 
05:36:54.470 --> 05:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
will get done in a timely fashion that
 
05:36:56.070 --> 05:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
that's what the department is asking for
 
05:36:56.080 --> 05:36:56.948 align:start position:0%
that's what the department is asking for
there

05:36:56.948 --> 05:36:56.958 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:36:58.548 --> 05:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
i think pretty simple
 
05:37:01.990 --> 05:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
um so we could do the underlying bill
 
05:37:03.190 --> 05:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
that part
 
05:37:05.110 --> 05:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
drop the things that are causing the
 
05:37:07.190 --> 05:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
difficulties and potential future you
 
05:37:09.270 --> 05:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
know waiting for other amendments and so
 
05:37:09.280 --> 05:37:10.548 align:start position:0%
know waiting for other amendments and so
on

05:37:10.548 --> 05:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:37:12.548 --> 05:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
05:37:15.670 --> 05:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so to be clear
 
05:37:20.470 --> 05:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
there is another amendment it's 2004 h
 
05:37:21.990 --> 05:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
which amends
 
05:37:25.830 --> 05:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
section 5 that you just referenced
 
05:37:25.840 --> 05:37:26.628 align:start position:0%
section 5 that you just referenced
and

05:37:26.628 --> 05:37:26.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:37:26.638 --> 05:37:27.750 align:start position:0%
and
com

05:37:27.750 --> 05:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
com
 
05:37:27.760 --> 05:37:29.350 align:start position:0%
com
yeah

05:37:29.350 --> 05:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:37:29.360 --> 05:37:30.708 align:start position:0%
yeah
comparing

05:37:30.708 --> 05:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
comparing
 
05:37:33.510 --> 05:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
um those two amendments which which i
 
05:37:36.230 --> 05:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
did over this weekend
 
05:37:36.240 --> 05:37:37.750 align:start position:0%
did over this weekend
um

05:37:37.750 --> 05:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:40.470 --> 05:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
that that needs to be reconciled yeah i
 
05:37:42.150 --> 05:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
think it's unfortunate that we senate
 
05:37:44.070 --> 05:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
members did not receive that
 
05:37:47.830 --> 05:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:49.430 --> 05:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry about it
 
05:37:52.310 --> 05:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:54.788 --> 05:37:54.798 align:start position:0%
and uh i hope that the next time that
 
05:37:56.070 --> 05:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
the information will be coming in a
 
05:37:58.390 --> 05:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
timely fashion from the department
 
05:38:00.150 --> 05:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
so we can act
 
05:38:02.788 --> 05:38:02.798 align:start position:0%
appropriately mr turner if you have any
 
05:38:04.470 --> 05:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
final comments there
 
05:38:06.708 --> 05:38:06.718 align:start position:0%
uh if i could take just a minute and
 
05:38:08.390 --> 05:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
again i appreciate everybody's concerned
 
05:38:10.470 --> 05:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
on on the timeliness here and i
 
05:38:12.788 --> 05:38:12.798 align:start position:0%
apologize for that
 
05:38:16.230 --> 05:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
but the potential consequence of not
 
05:38:17.750 --> 05:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
trying to correct
 
05:38:22.548 --> 05:38:22.558 align:start position:0%
the procedural language in 45 8 31
 
05:38:23.990 --> 05:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
is that if we
 
05:38:26.868 --> 05:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
if we are forced to deem us an
 
05:38:26.878 --> 05:38:29.270 align:start position:0%
if we are forced to deem us an
application

05:38:29.270 --> 05:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
application
 
05:38:31.750 --> 05:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
disapproved or deny an application
 
05:38:33.590 --> 05:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
because an applicant doesn't have enough
 
05:38:36.470 --> 05:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
time to respond to us
 
05:38:38.628 --> 05:38:38.638 align:start position:0%
that applicant would then have to we
 
05:38:40.628 --> 05:38:40.638 align:start position:0%
would have no choice but to deny a
 
05:38:42.470 --> 05:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
deficient application
 
05:38:44.070 --> 05:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
and the applicant would be forced to
 
05:38:46.548 --> 05:38:46.558 align:start position:0%
then resubmit the application including
 
05:38:48.948 --> 05:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
application fees we're trying to avoid
 
05:38:51.830 --> 05:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
that by allowing us to have
 
05:38:53.750 --> 05:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
a process in which we can request more
 
05:38:55.910 --> 05:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
information without formally denying an
 
05:38:57.430 --> 05:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
application thank you representative
 
05:38:57.440 --> 05:38:59.270 align:start position:0%
application thank you representative
manchuri

05:38:59.270 --> 05:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
manchuri
 
05:39:01.510 --> 05:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair do you have the the
 
05:39:04.070 --> 05:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
ability to waive application fees or
 
05:39:06.150 --> 05:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
waive any fees no application fees are
 
05:39:07.910 --> 05:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
set in stature they're set in statute
 
05:39:09.990 --> 05:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
yes so okay thank you representative
 
05:39:13.670 --> 05:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
power thank you mr chair um
 
05:39:13.680 --> 05:39:14.548 align:start position:0%
power thank you mr chair um
when

05:39:14.548 --> 05:39:14.558 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:39:17.750 --> 05:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
did you realize that this was an issue
 
05:39:21.310 --> 05:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:23.910 --> 05:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
rsa485-a colon 31.
 
05:39:26.948 --> 05:39:26.958 align:start position:0%
about 20 months ago three weeks ago
 
05:39:29.830 --> 05:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
we were presented we've been uh dealing
 
05:39:31.830 --> 05:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
with an application regarding a
 
05:39:33.510 --> 05:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
condominium conversion
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
condominium conveyance that didn't meet
 
05:39:38.470 --> 05:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
our subdivision requirements
 
05:39:42.150 --> 05:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
by definition by statutory definition
 
05:39:44.150 --> 05:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
condominium condominium conveyance
 
05:39:46.150 --> 05:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
requires subdivision approval in order
 
05:39:47.910 --> 05:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
to obtain subdivision approval you have
 
05:39:49.990 --> 05:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate lot loading which means
 
05:39:50.948 --> 05:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:39:52.548 --> 05:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
the property can support the proposed
 
05:39:54.470 --> 05:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
sewage load
 
05:39:57.670 --> 05:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
in this particular case there are many
 
05:40:00.868 --> 05:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
older cabins on this small property at
 
05:40:02.788 --> 05:40:02.798 align:start position:0%
spotford lake
 
05:40:05.030 --> 05:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
and we've been going back and forth with
 
05:40:06.708 --> 05:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
the applicant to try to resolve these
 
05:40:06.718 --> 05:40:08.548 align:start position:0%
the applicant to try to resolve these
issues

05:40:08.548 --> 05:40:08.558 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:40:10.070 --> 05:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
they obtained council the council
 
05:40:12.470 --> 05:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
pointed out this problem that we've had
 
05:40:12.480 --> 05:40:13.750 align:start position:0%
pointed out this problem that we've had
in

05:40:13.750 --> 05:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:40:17.190 --> 05:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
45 831 again the department's
 
05:40:19.510 --> 05:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation of disapprove was not
 
05:40:21.430 --> 05:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
deny the department's
 
05:40:24.070 --> 05:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation of disapprove was
 
05:40:26.830 --> 05:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
not approved not deny request more
 
05:40:29.270 --> 05:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
information it was pointed out to us
 
05:40:31.750 --> 05:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
that because we approve
 
05:40:31.760 --> 05:40:33.430 align:start position:0%
that because we approve
applications

05:40:33.430 --> 05:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
applications
 
05:40:37.590 --> 05:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
disapprove is synonymous with deny
 
05:40:39.030 --> 05:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
again that's not the way we've been
 
05:40:39.040 --> 05:40:40.390 align:start position:0%
again that's not the way we've been
doing

05:40:40.390 --> 05:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:40:43.110 --> 05:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
our business for 40 years
 
05:40:45.350 --> 05:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh and quite frankly if
 
05:40:45.360 --> 05:40:46.310 align:start position:0%
uh and quite frankly if
well

05:40:46.310 --> 05:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:40:48.868 --> 05:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
it is the case right now that
 
05:40:50.070 --> 05:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
all of these
 
05:40:52.070 --> 05:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
applications that we haven't formally
 
05:40:54.230 --> 05:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
approved are now by law
 
05:40:54.240 --> 05:40:55.350 align:start position:0%
approved are now by law
approved

05:40:55.350 --> 05:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
approved
 
05:40:56.868 --> 05:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
regardless of the
 
05:40:58.948 --> 05:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
lack of compliance with current statutes
 
05:41:00.150 --> 05:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
and laws
 
05:41:01.910 --> 05:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh that's that can be a real problem
 
05:41:03.510 --> 05:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
05:41:05.910 --> 05:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
the deficiencies of an application we
 
05:41:08.470 --> 05:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
have to now prove everything
 
05:41:10.390 --> 05:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
again so
 
05:41:12.150 --> 05:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
this was brought to our attention about
 
05:41:14.548 --> 05:41:14.558 align:start position:0%
three weeks ago and we've been trying to
 
05:41:16.868 --> 05:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
not only draft
 
05:41:18.868 --> 05:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
proposed language here to fix the
 
05:41:21.350 --> 05:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
problem but we're also been scrambling
 
05:41:23.670 --> 05:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
to try and come up with a legitimate way
 
05:41:23.680 --> 05:41:24.548 align:start position:0%
to try and come up with a legitimate way
to

05:41:24.548 --> 05:41:24.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:41:27.110 --> 05:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
address these deficient applications
 
05:41:28.788 --> 05:41:28.798 align:start position:0%
again we've we've asked for more
 
05:41:31.270 --> 05:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
information we haven't received it in 15
 
05:41:32.628 --> 05:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
or 30 days
 
05:41:34.470 --> 05:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
you know we've been waiting for for
 
05:41:36.310 --> 05:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
applicants to respond and maybe it takes
 
05:41:38.628 --> 05:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
them more time to develop the answers
 
05:41:40.708 --> 05:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
that we need
 
05:41:42.150 --> 05:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
but all those applications are now
 
05:41:43.910 --> 05:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
deemed approved this is targeting
 
05:41:45.990 --> 05:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
including this condominium convention if
 
05:41:47.270 --> 05:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
you knew about this
 
05:41:50.150 --> 05:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
of your agency knew about this
 
05:41:51.670 --> 05:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
three weeks ago
 
05:41:55.110 --> 05:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
why are we the last day before this
 
05:41:57.350 --> 05:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
whole process gets cut off
 
05:42:00.628 --> 05:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
uh why are we why are we at this point
 
05:42:01.990 --> 05:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
why couldn't we have done something in
 
05:42:05.190 --> 05:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:07.990 --> 05:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
we we well
 
05:42:09.350 --> 05:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
i guess that's a that's a very good
 
05:42:11.030 --> 05:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
question i
 
05:42:12.708 --> 05:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not familiar enough with the
 
05:42:15.510 --> 05:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
legislative process to be able to just
 
05:42:17.750 --> 05:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
change statute i thought
 
05:42:19.910 --> 05:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
my impression is it takes this process
 
05:42:21.670 --> 05:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
to go through to change statutory
 
05:42:24.948 --> 05:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
language representative power
 
05:42:27.270 --> 05:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
um mr chair i'd like to point out that
 
05:42:30.470 --> 05:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
if hp 1293 didn't exist
 
05:42:33.590 --> 05:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
then des wouldn't be
 
05:42:35.910 --> 05:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
attempting to
 
05:42:37.910 --> 05:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
address an issue
 
05:42:39.430 --> 05:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
in this manner
 
05:42:41.990 --> 05:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
they would
 
05:42:44.788 --> 05:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
be waiting until the filing period
 
05:42:48.230 --> 05:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
to file on lsr
 
05:42:49.510 --> 05:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
or the senate would have put it on a
 
05:42:50.948 --> 05:42:50.958 align:start position:0%
forum i'm gonna run a bill and you'd be
 
05:42:53.030 --> 05:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
crazy man that's a good question two
 
05:42:55.350 --> 05:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
minute recess mr pyramid yes uh uh are
 
05:42:59.190 --> 05:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
you is the senate ready to go off and
 
05:43:02.150 --> 05:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
get firm up your position in a small a
 
05:44:38.948 --> 05:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:38.958 --> 05:44:43.350 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:44:43.350 --> 05:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:38.948 --> 05:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:40.390 --> 05:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr chairman i won't speak
 
05:53:41.910 --> 05:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
for my colleague but say that if if
 
05:53:44.150 --> 05:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
there was agreement on taking that
 
05:53:46.708 --> 05:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
procedural part and the underlying bill
 
05:53:48.548 --> 05:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
i think would be all good to go
 
05:53:50.788 --> 05:53:50.798 align:start position:0%
if that's not the way we want to go then
 
05:53:52.788 --> 05:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
we can chat briefly and see what we can
 
05:53:52.798 --> 05:53:55.270 align:start position:0%
we can chat briefly and see what we can
do

05:53:55.270 --> 05:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:55.280 --> 05:53:56.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:53:56.470 --> 05:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:53:59.110 --> 05:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
the concern that i have
 
05:54:00.708 --> 05:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
is that in the absence of changing
 
05:54:04.070 --> 05:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
section five and six and adopting that
 
05:54:06.470 --> 05:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
that the department's only option
 
05:54:08.548 --> 05:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
for any
 
05:54:10.948 --> 05:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
project any construction project going
 
05:54:13.030 --> 05:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
forward in which there's a need for an
 
05:54:14.628 --> 05:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
exchange of information
 
05:54:17.910 --> 05:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
their only option is to deny the project
 
05:54:19.190 --> 05:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's good head work in
 
05:54:20.868 --> 05:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
the middle of a housing crisis
 
05:54:23.670 --> 05:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
i think that this language works 2004
 
05:54:25.430 --> 05:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist i don't have it it's never
 
05:54:27.270 --> 05:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
been adopted it's never been presented
 
05:54:28.788 --> 05:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
so as far as i'm concerned that doesn't
 
05:54:31.350 --> 05:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
exist as an amendment
 
05:54:33.350 --> 05:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
my concern going forward again is that
 
05:54:35.110 --> 05:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
the only option that des has to
 
05:54:36.788 --> 05:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
responsibly perform its functions for
 
05:54:38.390 --> 05:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
the people of the state is to deny any
 
05:54:39.830 --> 05:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
application that goes beyond the time
 
05:54:39.840 --> 05:54:40.868 align:start position:0%
application that goes beyond the time
limits

05:54:40.868 --> 05:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
limits
 
05:54:42.788 --> 05:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
that's the problem that sections five
 
05:54:44.390 --> 05:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
and six would solve
 
05:54:46.150 --> 05:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
and that's why i would ask that uh that
 
05:54:48.788 --> 05:54:48.798 align:start position:0%
we get that language incorporated
 
05:54:52.310 --> 05:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:55.830 --> 05:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so um to be clear
 
05:54:57.990 --> 05:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
your the statement that you just made
 
05:55:03.110 --> 05:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
you're referencing the amendment 1825 s
 
05:55:05.590 --> 05:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:55:06.750 --> 05:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
while i
 
05:55:06.760 --> 05:55:08.310 align:start position:0%
while i
understand

05:55:08.310 --> 05:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:55:10.788 --> 05:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
your your point the point that i would
 
05:55:12.548 --> 05:55:12.558 align:start position:0%
make is that there's
 
05:55:14.788 --> 05:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
further amendments
 
05:55:18.390 --> 05:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
which fix that so the problem is with
 
05:55:22.310 --> 05:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
with the the wording in 1825
 
05:55:22.320 --> 05:55:23.190 align:start position:0%
with the the wording in 1825
s

05:55:23.190 --> 05:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
s
 
05:55:25.110 --> 05:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
is that it's insufficient there's
 
05:55:27.350 --> 05:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's problems with it and it's the
 
05:55:29.430 --> 05:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
language as written in that amendment is
 
05:55:32.150 --> 05:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
not going to accomplish what the des
 
05:55:34.070 --> 05:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
needs it to do
 
05:55:35.990 --> 05:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
yes well that's why i suggested if you
 
05:55:39.030 --> 05:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
were to take what what does in that
 
05:55:42.150 --> 05:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
the mythical 2024 to whatever it is 2004
 
05:55:45.510 --> 05:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
amendment and and uh you know rewrite
 
05:55:47.350 --> 05:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
what we got here with that language we
 
05:55:49.030 --> 05:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
could vote on that today
 
05:55:51.750 --> 05:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative so thank you mr chair
 
05:55:51.760 --> 05:55:52.948 align:start position:0%
yes representative so thank you mr chair
so

05:55:52.948 --> 05:55:52.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:55:54.230 --> 05:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's the same
 
05:55:56.708 --> 05:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
response my understanding is that
 
05:55:59.430 --> 05:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
there's an additional amendment which
 
05:56:01.390 --> 05:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
further changes
 
05:56:04.868 --> 05:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
2004 h that we don't yet have is that
 
05:56:07.190 --> 05:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
the case
 
05:56:08.470 --> 05:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
sorry um
 
05:56:10.070 --> 05:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
we actually looked at that there was
 
05:56:12.070 --> 05:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
very some very very minor changes that
 
05:56:14.548 --> 05:56:14.558 align:start position:0%
aren't necessary so in other words that
 
05:56:17.030 --> 05:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
that what you have there
 
05:56:18.708 --> 05:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
would be
 
05:56:20.788 --> 05:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
what we could do but if we can't do it
 
05:56:23.510 --> 05:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:25.590 --> 05:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh any further
 
05:56:25.600 --> 05:56:28.470 align:start position:0%
okay uh any further
comments

05:56:28.470 --> 05:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:31.430 --> 05:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative power could
 
05:56:33.030 --> 05:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
could mr tardif
 
05:56:34.390 --> 05:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
comment on
 
05:56:35.990 --> 05:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
on that remark that was just made
 
05:56:38.868 --> 05:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
because email was removed and then there
 
05:56:42.070 --> 05:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
was some other language that was as such
 
05:56:43.590 --> 05:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
that needed to be
 
05:56:44.628 --> 05:56:44.638 align:start position:0%
put in
 
05:56:46.948 --> 05:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
and i thought that that was very key to
 
05:56:49.190 --> 05:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
clarifying what what was
 
05:56:51.830 --> 05:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
being asked
 
05:56:53.990 --> 05:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
of when you were asking for additional
 
05:56:56.310 --> 05:56:56.320 align:start position:0%
information in order for this language
 
05:56:59.110 --> 05:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
to be tight so i contend that we in fact
 
05:57:01.670 --> 05:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
do need need it
 
05:57:04.070 --> 05:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
that language we're waiting for
 
05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
the uh relative to the amendment 2004 h
 
05:57:14.788 --> 05:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:17.670 --> 05:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
12 11 and 12 where it says and deemed
 
05:57:20.150 --> 05:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
administratively complete
 
05:57:24.310 --> 05:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh that is in reference only to a
 
05:57:26.150 --> 05:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
septic system application a sewage a
 
05:57:28.548 --> 05:57:28.558 align:start position:0%
waste disposal system application
 
05:57:31.590 --> 05:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
when we uh proposed the amendment we
 
05:57:34.230 --> 05:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
were hoping that that same term
 
05:57:39.190 --> 05:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:41.590 --> 05:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh at the end of line seven where
 
05:57:44.310 --> 05:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
it says fees are received
 
05:57:46.628 --> 05:57:46.638 align:start position:0%
it doesn't include the term and deemed
 
05:57:49.270 --> 05:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
administratively complete the difference
 
05:57:51.270 --> 05:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
as far as the administratively complete
 
05:57:53.270 --> 05:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
if i could just take a second
 
05:57:56.868 --> 05:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:58.788 --> 05:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
support staff who looks at every
 
05:58:00.470 --> 05:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
application that comes into lrm
 
05:58:02.548 --> 05:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
including the subsurface systems bureau
 
05:58:04.708 --> 05:58:04.718 align:start position:0%
and they go through a very
 
05:58:08.070 --> 05:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
cur a very brief administrative
 
05:58:10.310 --> 05:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh completeness check for the subsurface
 
05:58:12.070 --> 05:58:12.080 align:start position:0%
system bureau applications that would
 
05:58:13.670 --> 05:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
include things like it you know that the
 
05:58:15.990 --> 05:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
plan has a designer stamp the fee is
 
05:58:16.000 --> 05:58:17.030 align:start position:0%
plan has a designer stamp the fee is
accurate

05:58:17.030 --> 05:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
05:58:19.110 --> 05:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh there's a tax map and lot number it's
 
05:58:21.190 --> 05:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
not a technical review
 
05:58:23.590 --> 05:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
so what we're intending by inserting
 
05:58:25.190 --> 05:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
this and deemed administratively
 
05:58:26.948 --> 05:58:26.958 align:start position:0%
complete phrase
 
05:58:30.390 --> 05:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
is that the actual 15 and 30 day
 
05:58:32.548 --> 05:58:32.558 align:start position:0%
technical review time frames wouldn't
 
05:58:33.990 --> 05:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
start until it was deemed
 
05:58:36.150 --> 05:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
administratively complete for instance
 
05:58:36.160 --> 05:58:37.190 align:start position:0%
administratively complete for instance
if

05:58:37.190 --> 05:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:58:38.628 --> 05:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
if during the administrative
 
05:58:41.430 --> 05:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
completeness process they find that a
 
05:58:43.110 --> 05:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
designer forgot to put their designer
 
05:58:46.548 --> 05:58:46.558 align:start position:0%
stamp on the plan and we send it back
 
05:58:48.070 --> 05:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
say hey you forgot your designer stamp
 
05:58:49.350 --> 05:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
something that simple if they don't get
 
05:58:51.990 --> 05:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
it back to us in 15 days
 
05:58:55.030 --> 05:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
we have to deny it the way it is now so
 
05:58:56.548 --> 05:58:56.558 align:start position:0%
we're trying to
 
05:58:58.150 --> 05:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
only include
 
05:59:01.110 --> 05:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
the technical review process
 
05:59:03.350 --> 05:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
is it senator one last comment please
 
05:59:05.190 --> 05:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so i guess the question is that if
 
05:59:07.510 --> 05:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
we were to add that phrase at line seven
 
05:59:09.830 --> 05:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
as indicated we would have that of that
 
05:59:11.510 --> 05:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
of that language would be the language
 
05:59:12.708 --> 05:59:12.718 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
05:59:15.670 --> 05:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
is what satisfies and if you would agree
 
05:59:18.310 --> 05:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:20.470 --> 05:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:59:22.548 --> 05:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
then the underlying bill we could vote
 
05:59:24.230 --> 05:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
on that
 
05:59:25.990 --> 05:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh comments from the
 
05:59:27.910 --> 05:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
committee on uh
 
05:59:30.310 --> 05:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
that no that's uh
 
05:59:30.320 --> 05:59:31.110 align:start position:0%
that no that's uh
we

05:59:31.110 --> 05:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:59:34.708 --> 05:59:34.718 align:start position:0%
asked just a little more definition uh
 
05:59:36.628 --> 05:59:36.638 align:start position:0%
is it do you have a line
 
05:59:39.910 --> 05:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
one to 17 type of uh
 
05:59:42.948 --> 05:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
way to point pinpoint it in the uh
 
05:59:45.430 --> 05:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
well i guess what we're saying
 
05:59:47.510 --> 05:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
and you could maybe take your copy and
 
05:59:49.190 --> 05:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
write it in where you want it and do it
 
05:59:51.110 --> 05:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
canadian up here yeah
 
05:59:53.990 --> 05:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
that that's what we would have
 
05:59:56.230 --> 05:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
and that would be for reference of any
 
05:59:56.240 --> 05:59:57.910 align:start position:0%
and that would be for reference of any
potential

05:59:57.910 --> 05:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
potential
 
06:00:01.590 --> 06:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
consideration representative pia mate
 
06:00:04.230 --> 06:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chia i i don't know
 
06:00:06.070 --> 06:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
maybe it's me but i think this thing is
 
06:00:08.788 --> 06:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
way out of control okay
 
06:00:10.150 --> 06:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill is the house
 
06:00:10.160 --> 06:00:11.270 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill is the house
position

06:00:11.270 --> 06:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
position
 
06:00:13.910 --> 06:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
i'm voting for that
 
06:00:18.150 --> 06:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:20.788 --> 06:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
i i think uh
 
06:00:22.868 --> 06:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
the position that we we are
 
06:00:22.878 --> 06:00:24.868 align:start position:0%
the position that we we are
uh

06:00:24.868 --> 06:00:24.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:00:27.830 --> 06:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
solidifying around is the fact that
 
06:00:29.670 --> 06:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh there's a lot of good stuff in the
 
06:00:31.190 --> 06:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
 
06:00:31.200 --> 06:00:32.390 align:start position:0%
underlying bill
however

06:00:32.390 --> 06:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
however
 
06:00:34.390 --> 06:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh when we're
 
06:00:35.910 --> 06:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
not comfortable that it hasn't been
 
06:00:37.510 --> 06:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
properly vetted
 
06:00:39.110 --> 06:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
in either the house
 
06:00:41.270 --> 06:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
or des i think this
 
06:00:43.030 --> 06:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
i think you guys would
 
06:00:45.510 --> 06:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
although you probably can't say it
 
06:00:47.990 --> 06:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
you guys would like more time
 
06:00:49.830 --> 06:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
to scrub this
 
06:00:51.750 --> 06:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
set of documents
 
06:00:55.270 --> 06:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:56.948 --> 06:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
respectfully is that we would ask that
 
06:00:56.958 --> 06:00:57.750 align:start position:0%
respectfully is that we would ask that
you

06:00:57.750 --> 06:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:01:00.150 --> 06:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
three ascend to
 
06:01:06.708 --> 06:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:08.390 --> 06:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
i think i need to reiterate the fact
 
06:01:09.750 --> 06:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
that what that's going to do to the
 
06:01:09.760 --> 06:01:11.750 align:start position:0%
that what that's going to do to the
process

06:01:11.750 --> 06:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:01:14.708 --> 06:01:14.718 align:start position:0%
is basically force des to deny any
 
06:01:17.190 --> 06:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
permit that exceeds the time limitations
 
06:01:19.110 --> 06:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
which is virtually every permit that has
 
06:01:20.868 --> 06:01:20.878 align:start position:0%
any kind of required additional
 
06:01:20.878 --> 06:01:21.990 align:start position:0%
any kind of required additional
information

06:01:21.990 --> 06:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:01:23.430 --> 06:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
to be submitted
 
06:01:25.990 --> 06:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
in the midst of a housing crisis
 
06:01:28.230 --> 06:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
okay and so i will not support that
 
06:01:28.240 --> 06:01:30.470 align:start position:0%
okay and so i will not support that
position

06:01:30.470 --> 06:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
position
 
06:01:32.788 --> 06:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
okay and any other firm further comments
 
06:01:35.750 --> 06:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:38.628 --> 06:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
okay okay yes
 
06:01:41.270 --> 06:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i i
 
06:01:43.030 --> 06:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
i'm absolutely there and as i'm
 
06:01:45.030 --> 06:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
understanding this you know
 
06:01:46.948 --> 06:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
either somebody in a black robe came up
 
06:01:49.030 --> 06:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
with uh you know who found this or or
 
06:01:51.190 --> 06:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
somebody uh you know attorneys found
 
06:01:54.470 --> 06:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
this and and i worry about language uh
 
06:01:57.670 --> 06:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
and and uh i agree i would wan i want
 
06:02:00.470 --> 06:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
section five to be added my concern is
 
06:02:02.708 --> 06:02:02.718 align:start position:0%
similar then to my colleagues
 
06:02:05.590 --> 06:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
that if we miss something here
 
06:02:07.990 --> 06:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
we you know if this is if this is coming
 
06:02:09.350 --> 06:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
through this quickly and we miss
 
06:02:11.430 --> 06:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
something here then we're going to go
 
06:02:14.310 --> 06:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
half back and fix it later i i'm
 
06:02:15.910 --> 06:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just
 
06:02:18.948 --> 06:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
i'm very reticent to say i i support my
 
06:02:21.110 --> 06:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
house position but i do because i really
 
06:02:22.868 --> 06:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
want this part to be added to that but
 
06:02:25.350 --> 06:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned thank you
 
06:02:27.990 --> 06:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay that concludes the if i might mr
 
06:02:30.070 --> 06:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
chair one more remark briefly okay
 
06:02:34.310 --> 06:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
thereby delaying for one year at least
 
06:02:34.320 --> 06:02:36.830 align:start position:0%
thereby delaying for one year at least
any

06:02:36.830 --> 06:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:39.270 --> 06:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
application that requires additional
 
06:02:41.350 --> 06:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
information which isn't submitted within
 
06:02:43.670 --> 06:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
the 15 or 30 day time frame
 
06:02:46.230 --> 06:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
understand the consequence unintended or
 
06:02:48.548 --> 06:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
otherwise and i think that
 
06:02:50.470 --> 06:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
the correction requested
 
06:02:52.948 --> 06:02:52.958 align:start position:0%
by the department for that very narrow
 
06:02:55.670 --> 06:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
scope giving them the the ability
 
06:02:58.230 --> 06:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
to do something other than deny is not
 
06:02:59.590 --> 06:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
unreasonable and i would ask the house
 
06:03:02.628 --> 06:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
to consider that thank you thank you yes
 
06:03:04.470 --> 06:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
06:03:06.948 --> 06:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
my comment to that would be
 
06:03:08.230 --> 06:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
then therefore
 
06:03:10.230 --> 06:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
applicants should
 
06:03:12.628 --> 06:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
ensure that their applications are in
 
06:03:14.150 --> 06:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
fact complete and have all the
 
06:03:14.160 --> 06:03:16.310 align:start position:0%
fact complete and have all the
information

06:03:16.310 --> 06:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:03:18.868 --> 06:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
then there won't be any problems
 
06:03:20.948 --> 06:03:20.958 align:start position:0%
if i might mr chair with all due respect
 
06:03:22.310 --> 06:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
have you reviewed any of the
 
06:03:24.628 --> 06:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
applications that come into des some of
 
06:03:26.708 --> 06:03:26.718 align:start position:0%
these complicated systems for for
 
06:03:28.708 --> 06:03:28.718 align:start position:0%
condominium complexes and so forth
 
06:03:30.310 --> 06:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of back and forth that
 
06:03:32.470 --> 06:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
goes on that used to go on
 
06:03:35.430 --> 06:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
until some lawyer or judge decided the
 
06:03:37.270 --> 06:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
language wasn't quite right
 
06:03:40.150 --> 06:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
so now we stop the entire process
 
06:03:42.788 --> 06:03:42.798 align:start position:0%
of of approving or
 
06:03:45.510 --> 06:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
allowing des and the applicant to
 
06:03:45.520 --> 06:03:48.230 align:start position:0%
allowing des and the applicant to
communicate

06:03:48.230 --> 06:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
communicate
 
06:03:50.948 --> 06:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
because of some reason that is as of yet
 
06:03:52.230 --> 06:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
unclear to me
 
06:03:54.548 --> 06:03:54.558 align:start position:0%
this is not anything difficult this is
 
06:03:56.230 --> 06:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
not anything abstruse
 
06:03:59.190 --> 06:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
this is a very simple clarification that
 
06:04:02.150 --> 06:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
enables the department to do its job we
 
06:04:03.670 --> 06:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
are stopping the department from doing
 
06:04:04.948 --> 06:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
the job for the people of the state of
 
06:04:07.270 --> 06:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire if we don't pass the
 
06:04:10.150 --> 06:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
language of 2004 as amended by mr
 
06:04:12.548 --> 06:04:12.558 align:start position:0%
tardiff well let me say that uh and this
 
06:04:15.830 --> 06:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
will be the end of it uh our offer still
 
06:04:17.430 --> 06:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
is on the table
 
06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:31.990 --> 06:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:34.070 --> 06:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you the uh
 
06:04:36.150 --> 06:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference
 
06:04:41.750 --> 06:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:45.270 --> 06:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to try to continue our
 
06:04:49.350 --> 06:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
conference on hb 1397. we have i see two
 
06:05:14.310 --> 06:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:25.110 --> 06:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:49.670 --> 06:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:49.680 --> 06:06:09.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:06:09.910 --> 06:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:09.920 --> 06:06:56.310 align:start position:0%
 
oh

06:06:56.310 --> 06:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:56.320 --> 06:09:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:09:01.110 --> 06:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:05.750 --> 06:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:08.150 --> 06:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's just it's a request for a recess
 
06:09:10.628 --> 06:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
till tomorrow at some point
 
06:09:21.110 --> 06:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:22.708 --> 06:09:22.718 align:start position:0%
i'm sure the speaker would be glad to
 
06:09:27.670 --> 06:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:29.670 --> 06:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
that's what we're going to have to do if
 
06:09:32.150 --> 06:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
some of these can't make it
 
06:09:35.350 --> 06:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:35.360 --> 06:09:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
nice

06:09:43.510 --> 06:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:45.750 --> 06:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
the reason i'm asking for a recess is so
 
06:09:47.670 --> 06:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
that i can speak to the senate president
 
06:09:49.830 --> 06:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
about this
 
06:09:51.590 --> 06:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
i respect
 
06:09:53.990 --> 06:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
you but i will
 
06:09:54.000 --> 06:09:55.190 align:start position:0%
you but i will
