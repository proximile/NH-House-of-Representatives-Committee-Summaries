our final member who's running a little
 
00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 align:start position:0%
late uh so she can get here so we'll be

00:01:58.840 --> 00:08:28.230 align:start position:0%
 
let

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:13:57.749 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.759 --> 00:30:59.230 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
there is any
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
voting so let's let's
 
00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:06.919 align:start position:0%
reconvene uh
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
the first bill is House Bill
 
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
601 uh relative to participation
 
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification program
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced price School
 
00:31:23.789 --> 00:31:23.799 align:start position:0%
meals now we have somebody who we held
 
00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720 align:start position:0%
this one because the Senate was having a
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
s Harry can you Harry please we're live
 
00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:35.799 align:start position:0%
now okay um we held this one because the
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
senate had a committee meeting and they
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
were going to report out by November 1st
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
which which they've
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
done as it turns
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
out representative Pichi muler ended up
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
on that committee much to his
 
00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
suarin uh surprise surprise so I would
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
ask if you if you would like to report
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the committee from and you
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr chair um I just need
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh okay so um the report should look
 
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.710 align:start position:0%
uh okay so um the report should look
like

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
this you put one at your place I think
 
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
and um to make a long story short um it
 
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.389 align:start position:0%
and um to make a long story short um it
was

00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:32:36.909 --> 00:32:36.919 align:start position:0%
U very useful discussion on U the
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
consequences of uh making uh you know
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
this policy change and uh the
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
committee with an amazingly long name I
 
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
believe it was the committee to study
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
the impact on snap and Medicaid changes
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
on free and reduced
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
Mill you know it it was a pretty long
 
00:32:58.029 --> 00:32:58.039 align:start position:0%
one basically we had um
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
a very good uh set of meetings where we
 
00:33:05.549 --> 00:33:05.559 align:start position:0%
um all agreed to look at the data in
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
specific ways and we've had a lot of
 
00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:10.519 align:start position:0%
work done by the various departments
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Education DHHS by the LBA
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
staff to try to um at best as as well as
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
possible estimate the financial impact
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
of those policy decisions and there is
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of data here that I don't
 
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
really plan to go into a lot of detail
 
00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:30.919 align:start position:0%
on but I will be happy to elaborate if
 
00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
questions um we've heard from all you
 
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
know um stakeholders that were uh
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
willing to testify and the report
 
00:33:43.629 --> 00:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
details who spoke and why the
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation was to
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
mostly keep things the way they are and
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
to address a very important issue which
 
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.029 align:start position:0%
to address a very important issue which
is

00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
that based on our discussions there are
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
two different groups of uh kids who
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
don't end up in this program there is
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
the group of parents who feel
 
00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
discouraged by the complexity of the
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
paperwork and just give up on it and
 
00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:11.079 align:start position:0%
there is the group of parents who simply
 
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to participate and uh you
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
know has no interest in it and um our
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
major recommendation on that side is to
 
00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
um look at we spoke with the Departments
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
the Commendation is to streamline that
 
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
form for people who are on Medicaid so
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
that if somebody's already on Medicaid
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
they should just have a form that says
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
this is my name I'm enrolled in Medicaid
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
go get my data from Medicaid and
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
determine my my eligibility for the
 
00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
program there should be no need to
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
redund provide redundant information
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
again and again to different state
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
agencies to get eligible for something
 
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
doing so would also respect the right of
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
the parents who simply don't want to be
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
in the program to not want to be in the
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
program obviously there is a minority
 
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:03.880 align:start position:0%
and a majority report so I'm sure that
 
00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
you had an opportunity to U read
 
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.510 align:start position:0%
you had an opportunity to U read
it

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
but nobody disagreed with that
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
particular recommendation you know the
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
these agreements were in whether we
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
should go you know further than that
 
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
anyway because of
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
the impact on privacy and because of a
 
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
huge financial impact I mean the numbers
 
00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
are staggering and I let Mickey describe
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
you know how um the um you know numbers
 
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
were obtained I believe that it would be
 
00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of uh the state to
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
U you know itl this bill and I would
 
00:35:48.109 --> 00:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
like to make that motion when the time
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
is appropriate whether it's now or later
 
00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
but I would be very happy to again
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about the
 
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
discussions we had tell you exactly what
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
the concerns were and we do have people
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.910 align:start position:0%
 
information

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
question um my question is um during our
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
multiple conversations we talked about
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
the potential of a pilot um maybe doing
 
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
a a few school districts and looking at
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
that using Medicaid direct
 
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
certification and um
 
00:36:32.069 --> 00:36:32.079 align:start position:0%
the um using that instead of um the free
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch forms that go out to
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
school parents um so instead of it Ling
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
it could we perhaps amend it and look at
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
it or interim study it amend it um and
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
then run it as a pilot part of the issue
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
is we really don't know exactly how many
 
00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
kids we have an assess ment that's been
 
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
provided of potentially the greatest
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
amount of kids that could be
 
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
participating um in this but we don't
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
actually know how many some may be in
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
preschool some may be um older than that
 
00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
right now so if we could just at least
 
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:17.720 align:start position:0%
instead of iing it at least look at
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
maybe the potential of a pilot with two
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
or three school districts um so would be
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
an amended document Bill and go for with
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
that we' we've agreed that the data that
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
comes is good data um that we would more
 
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:36.599 align:start position:0%
accurately know how many children are
 
00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
living in poverty in the state of New
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we really should try and
 
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
get those numbers so um if that's a
 
00:37:46.109 --> 00:37:46.119 align:start position:0%
possibility but also like to at least
 
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
let us hear from Hunger Solutions so
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
that they could talk a little bit about
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
why this bill is so important
 
00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
please well if someone would like to
 
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
here hi I'm Laura milikin I'm the

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
Solutions um we have been advocating for
 
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification so um uh
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
there are currently 38 States across the
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
country um who are participating in
 
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification it's a way
 
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
of streamlining the process of getting
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
kids who are eligible um for federal
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
benefits to be fed in school and we know
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
that the uh benefits of kids eating in
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
school are many many um not just for
 
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
individual children but for classrooms
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the short term for academic outcomes
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
for the children in the short and long
 
00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
term and for health Health outcomes um
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
for for children in the short and long
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
term so it's a very good
 
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
investment um in New Hampshire's future
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure all children are fed in
 
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
school the um the costs that are created
 
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh through Medicaid direct certification
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
have nothing to do with the
 
00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:21.319 align:start position:0%
certification Pro uh process itself or
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
the meals themselves it's all about the
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
state's education funding formula which
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
uses free and reduced meals as a proxy
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
for measuring poverty
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
so I completely understand that there
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
are mechanisms that are in place
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
relative to the um education funding
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
formula that costs additional cost but
 
00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:50.839 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification is about
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
making sure that those children who are
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
eligible can access the program um and
 
00:39:58.109 --> 00:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
that of course is is what we advocate
 
00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
for I mean I think that it's a very good
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
investment even at its cost um because
 
00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh investing in children is really
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
investing in in New Hampshire's future
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
um and that the benefits of having
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
children fed are many many um they're
 
00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
just reams of evidence I'm happy to
 
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
provide you with that evidence if you'd
 
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:17.960 align:start position:0%
like to see
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
it thank you so I believe that nobody
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
you know on the previous committee
 
00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
disagreed with the importance of kids
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
being fed I mean there is zero
 
00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
disagreement on that I just wanted to
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
double check do you have right now the
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
Assumption seems to be that if a kid is
 
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
not on free and redu they don't get fed
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
do we know that to be the case because
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
in my personal experience which is
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
limited to my town where I was on the
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
school board so it's just one town out
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
of the whole state kids were never
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
turned down for food they may end up
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
with a few dollars in debt at the end of
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
the year because we kept track of it but
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
the school pretty much wrote it off so
 
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
do we have any data that that
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
illustrates kids actually not receiving
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
food at schools or is it just a general
 
00:41:03.309 --> 00:41:03.319 align:start position:0%
concern because they are not on the free
 
00:41:03.319 --> 00:41:04.109 align:start position:0%
concern because they are not on the free
and

00:41:04.109 --> 00:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
clear I do not have any data about how
 
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
many children but uh are not being fed I
 
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
think probably there are children whose
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
families say to them please don't go
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
through the lunch line because we don't
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
have the money to pay for those meals um
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
so I think that there's you know it it's
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
there really no methods for measuring uh
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
those kids what I do know and um and I
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
only know it anecdotally perhaps my uh
 
00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues from um New Hampshire Ed
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
could speak to um what they're hearing
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
but what we're hearing at New Hampshire
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
hunger Solutions is that many many
 
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
schools are um incurring quite a lot of
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
school meal debt because of exactly what
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
you're saying that schools don't want to
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
turn away kids who want to eat um but uh
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
even though kids might be eligible the
 
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
schools are having to pay for it because
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
they're not act those kids are not
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
enrolled in pre-introduced
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:05.800 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so we see here
 
00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.349 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so we see here
that

00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:10.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
7700 new students would with this
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
program would start getting free and
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
reduced Lune do you know how much how
 
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
many students are currently getting free
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch and how much uh
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
federal funds are coming in for those
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
students um I I don't have the number
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
representative I um I'm sure there are
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
people in this room who have the exact
 
00:42:37.549 --> 00:42:37.559 align:start position:0%
answer to the question um my
 
00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
understanding is there are about 42,000
 
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
kids who are currently on free and
 
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
reduced meals um 100% of the meal cost
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
for those children are is reimbursed by
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:53.559 align:start position:0%
government um so that's quite a number
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
of federal dollars that are flowing into
 
00:42:57.069 --> 00:42:57.079 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
um and and just to be clear the
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
7721 that was um estimated um those kids
 
00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
are not new students those are students
 
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:08.559 align:start position:0%
who are already being served in school
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
districts those are kids who are living
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
schools thank you Mr chair I just want
 
00:43:20.589 --> 00:43:20.599 align:start position:0%
to answer that question because we do
 
00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:22.280 align:start position:0%
have the memo from the Department of
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
Education that has quite a bit of detail
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
on that and if you look at that other
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
memo that starts with uh you know the
 
00:43:32.349 --> 00:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
one from Mark manganelo dated 10 2023
 
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
which everybody on the committee should
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
have if you look on the second page this
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
is a complicated discussion but those
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
are the best numbers we have the
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
enrollment dropped during during coid
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
because of
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
the policies policy changes on Medicaid
 
00:43:50.589 --> 00:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
Eligibility that no longer required
 
00:43:52.589 --> 00:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
recertification and allowed everybody to
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
stay on the program whether they were
 
00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
eligible or not as a result there was a
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
drop in fnr enrollment that was larger
 
00:44:02.829 --> 00:44:02.839 align:start position:0%
than the drop in Medicaid because there
 
00:44:06.829 --> 00:44:06.839 align:start position:0%
was no need to re recertified so we
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
tried to project this on the last known
 
00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
year that was solid which is the 20
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
school year 2020 P that the numbers are
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
getting skewed by the impact of the
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
federal policy changes so there is this
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
is the best analysis we have the memo
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
goes into quite a bit of detail on how
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
it was achieved and what are the
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
assumptions that were made they're just
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
the best numbers we have available but
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
nobody can say they're 100% accurate
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's just best effort and the best data
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
we have to work on with it um and that's
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify that you know
 
00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:47.200 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair so we've got
 
00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.670 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair so we've got
this

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
blockage um where you have the
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
intersection of we all I appreciate you
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
know um representative papich mu
 
00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
giving that the you know the the
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee supported the idea of you
 
00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
know being able to provide a better data
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
for children in order to get free and
 
00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch um the blockage seems to
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
be that that number is used as part of
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
the education formula and the immediate
 
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
outcome of that right now as um M Milan
 
00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:19.559 align:start position:0%
was saying is that schools are acre debt
 
00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:22.839 align:start position:0%
because of that um I don't see us
 
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
getting through the blockage right now
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
because of the education formula is so
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
complicated um but and for far less than
 
00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.950 align:start position:0%
complicated um but and for far less than
$191

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
$191
 
00:45:36.549 --> 00:45:36.559 align:start position:0%
million is there an opportunity um to
 
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
provide a fund for the state to create
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
an order to reimburse schools for the
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
loss um that they incur in providing
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
lunches for them I mean that's sortly an
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
entirely different topic but I don't see
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
us getting through this block right now
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
because of the education funding formula
 
00:45:56.349 --> 00:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
is set and it's complicated um it
 
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem like it would be a heavy
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
lift in order to reimburse schools for
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
um the free and reduced lunch for the
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
children who can have it and maybe that
 
00:46:06.549 --> 00:46:06.559 align:start position:0%
would open up the Avenue for students um
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
or would give the schools some freedom
 
00:46:11.829 --> 00:46:11.839 align:start position:0%
in terms of allowing students who they
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
know need the food um but aren't going
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
through the process for the the state
 
00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking for a way to get
 
00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:20.079 align:start position:0%
through this now because I think we need
 
00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
to address this later we all seem to
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
support the idea of using um a better
 
00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
information the Medicaid information for
 
00:46:28.549 --> 00:46:28.559 align:start position:0%
identifying these students but right now
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
I think we're kind we're kind of stuck
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
so is there a way of helping the school
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
can we've talked often about free and
 
00:46:47.309 --> 00:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
reduced but we never separate them free
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
is one level of income reduced is
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
another and the thing we most often hear
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
is oh the reduced don't pay any anything
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
even though they're supposed to pay
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
something so some of this is as a result
 
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard examples before us oh we're
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
30,000 in debt because of the reduced
 
00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
population didn't pay
 
00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
anything and I think there's a confusion
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
among those who are on free and reduced
 
00:47:16.549 --> 00:47:16.559 align:start position:0%
and does anybody have a number does does
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
our LBA person know any number of this
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
group is free and this group is reduced
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
and quite often the reduced group either
 
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
is not paying what they should be or
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
they're not paying at all but we're
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
hearing frequently from schools that say
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
with 30,000 or so many dollars in debt
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
from people who didn't pay on the
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
reduced level so do you know what those
 
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
are thank you doe can step in but I
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
think it's uh 85% of the number is free
 
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
and 15% or so is reduced that about am I
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
is that close we do you have copies for
 
00:48:08.109 --> 00:48:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
around yes go ahead Mr chair um I just
 
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask I don't know the answer to
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
this one do we have any state level data
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
on the total impact of you know school
 
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
lunch Deb because I know that in wiam we
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
just wrote it off you know we paid for
 
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
it from General funds and we were done
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
with it but I obviously don't want to
 
00:48:33.069 --> 00:48:33.079 align:start position:0%
assume that what happens in wiam happens
 
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
everywhere else so if we have an idea of
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
what the impact is you
 
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
useful good morning um Kelly Rambo from
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education Bureau of
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
nutrition and wellness Melissa white
 
00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
division director for learner support
 
00:48:53.069 --> 00:48:53.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Education
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
sorry I I don't too slowly Melissa white
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
y division director for learner support
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for that question um
 
00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
we do not have that that data um at the
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
the department that's at the local level
 
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
y if I may follow up would it be
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
possible to ask the schools to provide
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
that number so that we maybe have it by
 
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the next budget process
 
00:49:26.549 --> 00:49:26.559 align:start position:0%
because I think it would be an
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
useful you know data piece to help us
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
figure out how to fund schools properly
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
you know to make sure that no kid who
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
needs food is left without food that
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
should not be happening but there are a
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
lot of different ways to do it and to
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
decide how we we could really use some
 
00:49:47.069 --> 00:49:47.079 align:start position:0%
detail on you know what are the maybe
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
ask them retroactively too for going a
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
few years back you know this is how much
 
00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
we had every year and this is what we
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
did if it doesn't create too much of a
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
we could definitely survey the field and
 
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
a request that the local education
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
agencies you know voluntarily provide us
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
with any kind of um figures that they
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
have for their unpaid I think the part
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
that we um at the department have
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
reiterated a few times is that we know
 
00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
the reduced lunch number so if we're
 
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
looking at a number that we're pretty
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
solid with as far as what we would want
 
00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:22.839 align:start position:0%
to cover to meet the needs of students
 
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
we're already paying for the breakfast
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
portion for those students that are on
 
00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:29.559 align:start position:0%
identified for reduced we could pay at
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
the state level for the remainder of
 
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
that reduced lunch component yeah when
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
we get into the um specifics of
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
qualifying for some of these other
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
programs and we're looking at Medicaid
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
direct certification those bring in some
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
different pieces but that number
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
specifically we do have and we do know
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
in that number you can see there is in
 
00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
front of you so that's just something
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
that um I wanted to bring up because I
 
00:50:59.069 --> 00:50:59.079 align:start position:0%
know that was mentioned a couple times
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
like what numbers can we look at to
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
provide that the support that we do know
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
that there's a need for can I ask what
 
00:51:09.789 --> 00:51:09.799 align:start position:0%
what number are you using now for total
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
students for the state
 
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:15.839 align:start position:0%
approximately total enrollment or number
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
of free and reduced no total total
 
00:51:20.109 --> 00:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
students how many students I think we're
 
00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
around the range of 160,000 okay God
 
00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:25.640 align:start position:0%
that was because I'm looking at this 40
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
thousand I'm
 
00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
saying that's pretty close to 25% of the
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
student population yeah wow okay thank
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
you Mary thank you Mr chair um and thank
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question if in fact we
 
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
were to proceed maybe even with the
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
pilot um in terms of um Medicaid direct
 
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
certification um well I guess let me do
 
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
my first question first if in fact we
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
went to Medicaid direct certification
 
00:51:58.789 --> 00:51:58.799 align:start position:0%
would it increase the amount of federal
 
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
dollars being returned to the state of
 
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.670 align:start position:0%
dollars being returned to the state of
New

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in many
 
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
areas well I can only speak to um for
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
what it would do for the department or
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
the local level um related to food
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
Melissa can maybe speak to um the other
 
00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
portion of it um but the it would go
 
00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:20.799 align:start position:0%
back to the local level um if there were
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
students that were qualified for
 
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that were not already currently
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
on another program um they would get
 
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
Federal funding um if the state of New
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was to be
 
00:52:37.309 --> 00:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
qualified um for the Medicaid for the um
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
USDA program but we have to be a part of
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
that program we cannot pilot it we
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
cannot look at you using a few school
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
districts we have to have be a part of
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
that program have that application
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
accepted by USDA before we could do
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
anything so if we're looking at trying
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
to do um some sort of pilot we're going
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
to need to pay for that at the state
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
level the feds will not reimburse us for
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
those costs because they do not allow us
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
to um use some sort of other type of
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
identification it has to go through
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
their free and reduced eligible um
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
form just to followup um in our
 
00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
conversations when we had the um
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
combined committee with um education we
 
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
talked about um if in fact we were to go
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid direct certification when
 
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
individual families were signing up for
 
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
it they could be given the option of in
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
fact accepting or um saying that they
 
00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to be part of free and
 
00:53:39.789 --> 00:53:39.799 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch meals so it wouldn't be
 
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
that everybody who's identified it would
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
help the state if everybody's identified
 
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
is identified but at the local level
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
those families who don't want to be
 
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
determined as such could sign off saying
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
that they were not not interested and
 
00:53:58.589 --> 00:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
they would do that at the time at which
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
they sign up for
 
00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so unfortunately um that would
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
be a question for DHHS um because the
 
00:54:08.789 --> 00:54:08.799 align:start position:0%
program is operated through DHHS and I I
 
00:54:10.349 --> 00:54:10.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that thank
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
you but I think we just want to also
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
reiterate that we have to be accepted
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
into the USDA program they have not
 
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
opened up that application period they
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
have said this fall they were going to
 
00:54:22.109 --> 00:54:22.119 align:start position:0%
do that they still have not done that so
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
we don't even have the opportunity to
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
apply for um to be a part of the
 
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification program
 
00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.549 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification program
until

00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
USDA releases that an and does a request
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
for applications for that and then when
 
00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
they do we can apply and then kind of
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
move on to these next pieces but it's
 
00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to kind of Jump Ahead or say
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to kind of create our own
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
system or do some or our own
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
certification they they're not going to
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
reimburse us for those those costs for
 
00:54:52.349 --> 00:54:52.359 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to I I hear you
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
and I remember that we spoke about this
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
obviously you know a few weeks ago that
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
the federal rules are you know the
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
federal process is the federal process
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
and we don't really have control over it
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
I do remember that we spoke about and
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
I'd appreciate if you confirm if my
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is correct or not that if
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
instead of doing direct certification we
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
are allowing people who are already
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
enrolled in Medicaid to just provide
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
that you know one checkbox form to the
 
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
school and just say I want to apply for
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
free and clear instead of giving you the
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
data I'm enrolled in Medicaid and you
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
have my consent to work through doe and
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
DHHS and get that data my understanding
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
is that that may be possible without new
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
legislation it would just be
 
00:55:38.029 --> 00:55:38.039 align:start position:0%
administrative changes because you'd
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
have the consent of the parent to you
 
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
know share that information between the
 
00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.349 align:start position:0%
know share that information between the
state

00:55:43.349 --> 00:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
agencies um so unfortunately that would
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
not work um because currently in the
 
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we are not on
 
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid at the USDA level um so the the
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
only programs that we operate as a uh
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
direct certification are snap tanif um
 
00:56:06.069 --> 00:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
and that is Medicaid is not um allowed
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
for USDA reimbursement so unfortunately
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
that method would not work at this
 
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
moment in time it could be something
 
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
that that if we were on the program it
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
could be explored but because um that
 
00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
that door isn't open for the State of
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that um is unallowable so
 
00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
just as a clarification something Chang
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
since the time we talked about this a
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
few weeks ago because when we talked
 
00:56:30.589 --> 00:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
about it in committee my understanding
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
and the committee's understanding was
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
that this was a possibility because
 
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
again the parent would give you consent
 
00:56:38.349 --> 00:56:38.359 align:start position:0%
to you know access their data so you
 
00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:41.799 align:start position:0%
guys did more research and changed the
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
not until we actually are approved by
 
00:56:47.069 --> 00:56:47.079 align:start position:0%
the US um agricultural Department to
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
participate in this program they won't
 
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
we can't do that until we're part of
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
that direct certification program so I
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
think the committee is talking about
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay a couple steps down the road when
 
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
we get to that point once we've been
 
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
accepted and USDA has approved our
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
ability to be a part of this program
 
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
then we can look at what that would look
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
like but where we're at right now is
 
00:57:10.349 --> 00:57:10.359 align:start position:0%
we're not a part of it we wouldn't be
 
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
able to use the Medicaid direct
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
certification at this time we wouldn't
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
sorry I I just want to clarify because
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'm not asking about direct
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
certification right we know that we are
 
00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
not in it even if we approved it today
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
we have no idea when it may happen
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
because it depends on the feds so
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
leaving that off the table for now we're
 
00:57:30.109 --> 00:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
just talking about what we could do
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
today people are already enrolled in
 
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid you know the HHS has their data
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
they already provided the data to the
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
HHS to get you know enrolled in Medicaid
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
right is there any roadblock between
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
just allowing a person who already
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
enrolled in Medicaid to tell the school
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
to you know connect through the doe to
 
00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:51.640 align:start position:0%
the HHS and get all that data they
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
already provided instead of using a huge
 
00:57:56.670 --> 00:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
application for form for the fnr that's
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm talking about I'm not talking
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
about I just want to clarify and that
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
the state would then pay for the entire
 
00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
cost of the
 
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
meal I do not because the feds would not
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
that we okay so you saying that we could
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
do it could do that but the feds would
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
not recognize it correct the state would
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
have to pay for that
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
cost that's new information that I
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate having thank you I think the
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
um the confusing piece might be is that
 
00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
this actual program at USDA is called
 
00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification so I think
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
the the title of it can also be
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
confusing as well too um and although
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
you're not speaking to the direct
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
certification portion of it um the
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program for USDA um that little
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
checkbox when we um as the state of New
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire apply for those benefits to be
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
able to use cross inter agency that
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
little checkbox at USDA is not there for
 
00:58:57.069 --> 00:58:57.079 align:start position:0%
for for Medicaid so whether it's we're
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
using the information directly certified
 
00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:01.039 align:start position:0%
and we're getting a file and and
 
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
matching or um the parents are simply
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
saying as as you're um identifying that
 
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
we would like to opt in or we would like
 
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
to say yes you can use that and it's not
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
directly certifying neither of those two
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire as USDA
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
recognizes to be able to get that
 
00:59:22.829 --> 00:59:22.839 align:start position:0%
Federal funding back um is not
 
00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
applicable at this moment in time what
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
Melissa is um speaking to is that if the
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
the state would like to go in that
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
direction the state would need to fund
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
um those those students or those kiddos
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
that that would be on um that would go
 
00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:40.280 align:start position:0%
into that so it can be done but it's
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
just a question of whether you get
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
Federal money for it or you don't okay
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
so that's what's in the balance there
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I appreciate the
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
clarification yeah you thank you Mr
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
chair you I might have a little more
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
understanding here I hate to be the one
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
one that says I have no idea what this
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
means um but in the chart you handed out
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
um I can add up the numbers and I get
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
that but I still don't know what they
 
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
mean um the 122 million is that what
 
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
would would you walk me through this
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
chart so I don't have to ask questions
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
sure I'd be happy to um so to answer
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
your first question um
 
01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:20.039 align:start position:0%
the 122 um million at the bottom would
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
be um just for complete reference if the
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
state was to pay for all meals for all
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
students that are currently um that we
 
01:00:30.029 --> 01:00:30.039 align:start position:0%
have for enrollment in the state of New
 
01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:32.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when you say all meals you
 
01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
mean all 160,000 students or all 160,000
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
students not the 42,000 who are
 
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
currently enrolled that is correct the
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
chart above will break it down to um the
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
the free students obviously that's fully
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
covered by the federal
 
01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement um and then they're
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
reduced um and it's broken down by
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch because obviously
 
01:00:55.029 --> 01:00:55.039 align:start position:0%
those prices are different different um
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
in the reimbursement that we get from
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
the federal department um so you can see
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
the meals um I'll just go through the
 
01:01:04.109 --> 01:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
columns the eligible students um
 
01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
currently that we have the data for
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
2223 um the meal price after the federal
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so what I did was I took
 
01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:14.839 align:start position:0%
the federal reimbursement less than um
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
so that would be what the cost would be
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
per meal to the state um and then the
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
the last column is the total column you
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
can also see already um to to Melissa
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
spoke to this before that um the state
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
is currently paying for the reduced
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
price breakfast for all of those
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
students um so that's why the total cost
 
01:01:39.309 --> 01:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
at the bottom um is the 122 million and
 
01:01:41.789 --> 01:01:41.799 align:start position:0%
it's less that um the what the state is
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
already currently paying um so you can
 
01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
also see that the total for um the
 
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
breakfast and lunch for um free and
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
reduced would be the 87
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
$3,000 um and since the state is already
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
paying 374 of that the difference would
 
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
be the
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
$499 can I ask some other questions sure
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
so the the 499 is does that still
 
01:02:11.789 --> 01:02:11.799 align:start position:0%
pertain to only the 32,000 eligible
 
01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
students here or is that the 160,000
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
students no that is just for the reduced
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
priced um lunch so so that's the sorry
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
um so that's the actual if you look at
 
01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:29.039 align:start position:0%
the reduced lunch that's
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
6,932 students um because the federal
 
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
government pays for all of the free
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
students so um so that would encumber
 
01:02:39.309 --> 01:02:39.319 align:start position:0%
all of those um all of those students so
 
01:02:41.789 --> 01:02:41.799 align:start position:0%
if we paid lunch and breakfast for the
 
01:02:45.269 --> 01:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
32,000 students who are eligible um then
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
you get the 374,000 plus the $499
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
correct okay and the 123 is if we paid
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
everything for everybody so we have
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
one number which is kind of in the real
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
world and then we have a very high
 
01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
estimate of if we covered everybody
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
um is there a way of nuancing that
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
because there are certainly a number of
 
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
people who would not need to pay the
 
01:03:10.309 --> 01:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
whole amount I'm wondering is there a
 
01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:11.720 align:start position:0%
way of just being able to reimburse
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
schools for their loss um as opposed to
 
01:03:16.589 --> 01:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
paying free and reduce lent for
 
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
everybody even those who actually really
 
01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
don't need
 
01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
it um that's uh data that we would need
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
that this is a situation the more you
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
are Mary thank you Mr
 
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
chair we know that currently there's not
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
a pilot program available to apply to at
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
the US um Department of a
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
agriculture if we choose to itl this
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
bill at this point in time we close that
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
option for the State of New Hampshire if
 
01:03:59.309 --> 01:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
we choose to give permission to the
 
01:04:02.349 --> 01:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to proceed with
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
this in the event that a pilot becomes
 
01:04:07.390 --> 01:04:07.400 align:start position:0%
available to apply
 
01:04:10.349 --> 01:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
for at that point in time we can always
 
01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
have a conversation about do we want to
 
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
do this or not but it just seems like
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
we're kind of cutting our
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
options in terms of number one we know
 
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
the data will be better in terms of the
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
adequacy fund
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
um we know that we'll be able to feed
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
more children um so I hate to see us itl
 
01:04:34.990 --> 01:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
this bill because we will not be even
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
sending a signal to the Department of
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
that that if in fact this becomes a
 
01:04:40.829 --> 01:04:40.839 align:start position:0%
reality they can't even apply for it
 
01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the authority to
 
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:45.400 align:start position:0%
do it so I just am am disheartened by
 
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that we would consider it Ling
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
601 um when it really is is putting a
 
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
roadblock in front of a lot of
 
01:04:59.549 --> 01:04:59.559 align:start position:0%
possibilities Mr chairman if we did
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
take in order for it to go into effect
 
01:05:14.269 --> 01:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
it would be about two to three years
 
01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:16.720 align:start position:0%
before um you know the the application
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
process um does take uh a year and then
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
um it would have to go into effect
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
either two or three years after that
 
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
I have to agree with representative
 
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
Murray I I think we're trying to cross a
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
bridge that we're not you're talking
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
about process you're saying we got to
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
get in the
 
01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
process we're in
 
01:05:43.269 --> 01:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
finance I'm looking at money and right
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
now it's a it's a $190 million decision
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
that we don't have in the
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
budget so if using this committee as as
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
as our screen to say that committee
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
recommended uh this is a pretty big bite
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
so I I can appreciate the process
 
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
discussion but when it gets down to are
 
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
we going to approve 190 million
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
additional dollars in the in the budget
 
01:06:12.029 --> 01:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
that's already been voted I can't
 
01:06:16.029 --> 01:06:16.039 align:start position:0%
support it so that's I'm with I'm I'm
 
01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
with representative Murray we've hit an
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
impass because we it's so complicated
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
process-wise that we're we're what are
 
01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
we voting on are we voting on a process
 
01:06:32.109 --> 01:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
or we voting on a budget and for me I
 
01:06:35.309 --> 01:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
I'm I got to look at the at the numbers
 
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
yes yeah thank you Mr chair I'm not sure
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
I'm on the itl point right yet but well
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
but I agree with you um you know my goal
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
is to try to find a solution um and my
 
01:06:47.789 --> 01:06:47.799 align:start position:0%
goal immediately here is to try to find
 
01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
a way to keep this going forward and I
 
01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's an interim study
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
um I'm uncomfortable of directly moving
 
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
it Forward not just not necessarily for
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
the money but also um somehow tying the
 
01:07:02.589 --> 01:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Education into something
 
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
that uh there may be consequences that
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
they're not anticipating uh that would
 
01:07:08.349 --> 01:07:08.359 align:start position:0%
make it more difficult for Department of
 
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
Education to do their work I'm just
 
01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
because we don't know I just have some
 
01:07:15.269 --> 01:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
hesitation about binding Department of
 
01:07:17.069 --> 01:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
Education as well as binding the budget
 
01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
to this um so I guess you know Mickey is
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
sort of our expert here and perhaps some
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
other people would know is there a way
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
to keep it alive to Pro to keep the proc
 
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
to keep us aware and on top of it so
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
that as things happen we can respond to
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
that I really support the idea um but
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
I'm very uncomfortable with the unknowns
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of the money and the unknowns
 
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
process thank you Mr chair um two quick
 
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
things one to address the you know
 
01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
comments from our colleague I believe
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
that whether we itl this bill or not
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
this is not a discussion that ending I
 
01:07:56.069 --> 01:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
mean this is something that's always on
 
01:07:58.549 --> 01:07:58.559 align:start position:0%
our radar we need to get more
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
information and decide on the right
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
policy to me the question about this
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
bill itself is whether this bill should
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
pass and in its current form there is no
 
01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
way I can support it especially since
 
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
you know uh chairman emeric was saying
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
that U the money is not in the budget as
 
01:08:16.749 --> 01:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
in we don't really you know have the
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
ability to pay for it if we pass it my
 
01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
real concern though is when we passed
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
the budget on the house floor this was
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
already in it when the Senate changed
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
the budget they removed it but they
 
01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
added even more funding through other
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
means so this 190 million that we are
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
looking to add we already added 193 plus
 
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
11.54 snap I mean the money is there it
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
may not be using this mechanism but to
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
me it would be F we would be double
 
01:08:50.789 --> 01:08:50.799 align:start position:0%
counting right now if we now change the
 
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
budget at this point in time so this to
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
is a discussion that needs to be part of
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
a regular budget process I cannot
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
support passing this bill at this time
 
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
because of where we are in the budget
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
cycle and because of what we just did
 
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
this spring where we addressed it the
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
best we could can we do better I'm sure
 
01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
that in the next year we'll try to do
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
even better but I don't think that it
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
telling this bill would in any way stop
 
01:09:21.789 --> 01:09:21.799 align:start position:0%
our work in that direction because I
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
think everybody here recognizes the
 
01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
importance of addressing those concerns
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:33.910 --> 01:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
possible we've had a lot of stuff about
 
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
childhood hunger which I believe is a
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
distraction in this bill there are no
 
01:09:41.789 --> 01:09:41.799 align:start position:0%
hungry children in New Hampshire and in
 
01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
the schools I I my own Local District
 
01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
has even solicited for money from
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
various organizations saying there are
 
01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
some children who they they don't get
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
paid for but I think that's a minor
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
amount we see all the money is that's
 
01:09:57.510 --> 01:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
going for free and we see the money that
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
should be paid for reduce that isn't
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
always paid those are some Sidelines
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
what I want to point out is we're like
 
01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
number five or six out of 50 states in
 
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
the cost per pupil I think it's
 
01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
ridiculous we're paying more now than
 
01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
some schools are charging for prep
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
schools we're paying over $220,000 per
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
student that's ridiculous and this is
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
just going to be more money we're
 
01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
already overpaid in my opinion I would
 
01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
never support this thank you
 
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
Dan thank you Mr chairman so am I
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
correct that that the amount of federal
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
funds per free and reduced CH child is
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
roughly $1,000 a
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
year Mr landrian maybe you could answer
 
01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.390 align:start position:0%
year Mr landrian maybe you could answer
or

01:10:45.390 --> 01:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
00 okay less than less than that can you
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
repeat the question the amount of
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
federal funds that come for on all of
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
these free and reduced students the
 
01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
42,000 students is it work out to
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
roughly $1,000 a year per
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
student it it actually depends on the um
 
01:11:09.189 --> 01:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
these numbers here are if every single
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
student eight every S I know these I'm
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
asking how much federal funds are coming
 
01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
it depends on the meals that are claimed
 
01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:18.310 align:start position:0%
it depends on the meals that are claimed
for

01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
reimbursement all
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
right let me ask it a different way my
 
01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.750 align:start position:0%
right let me ask it a different way my
my

01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
back of the envelope calculation is
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
roughly $6 a day per student times 175
 
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
days is roughly $1,000 is that correct
 
01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
I'd have to do I'm not as good with math
 
01:11:42.629 --> 01:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
um so I'd have I'd have to do it out um
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.629 --> 01:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
incorrectly Bart correct okay fine so
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about by adding 8,000
 
01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.310 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about by adding 8,000
students

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
is maybe we could get another eight M
 
01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
we're leaving $8 million or or seven or
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
something worth of federal funds on the
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
table right but but with our current
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
system you know as as um representative
 
01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.430 align:start position:0%
system you know as as um representative
Amer

01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
Amer
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
says it doesn't make sense to to spend
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
200 million to get
 
01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
eight you see what I mean uh that
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
anyways that's my that's my argument so
 
01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
these have these things have to be
 
01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
coordinated with the budget right
 
01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative Popovich Müller is
 
01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.629 align:start position:0%
representative Popovich Müller is
correct

01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
here we have to make a budget
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
anticipating these new
 
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
students right so that it works I mean
 
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
it makes sense at some point to try to
 
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
do this to pick up that bit of federal
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
funds but we can't do it now right
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
because um because the rest of the
 
01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
budget isn't coordinated with that
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
and all we would need to really move
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
forward um with the application process
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
is just legislation that would allow us
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
to just apply that that's that I think
 
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:07.719 align:start position:0%
there's more in this component of it but
 
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
any legislation that just allowed us to
 
01:13:11.189 --> 01:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
app to do the application process to
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
USDA then we could at least go towards
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
that first step and that that piece of
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
it is kind of like that first step we
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
were discussing and your applic would
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
have would would that have to have
 
01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
it because of um the way that New
 
01:13:35.629 --> 01:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uses are free and reduced this
 
01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
is specific to USDA and the
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so the adequacy portion
 
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the the USDA
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
portion of it so when we apply for that
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
we would not be indicating that in the
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
application process at
 
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
all okay
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is what we by
 
01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
passing 601 what would we what we would
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
be doing would be giving the department
 
01:14:08.629 --> 01:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
of Ed Authority no money authority to
 
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
proceed if in fact a Medicaid direct
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
certification pilot became
 
01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
available to which no dollars at this
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
point in time would be attached Mickey
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
am I right or
 
01:14:25.149 --> 01:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
wrong I would want some clarification on
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
what the department just said because it
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
was my understanding that if were the if
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
the state were to apply for this I don't
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
think we can say no once we're already
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
applied it would it would impact
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
adequacy at that point so I think we
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
would I I just I think the department
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
should just clarify the
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
last and I think we're just trying to
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
answer the questions about the process
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
piece and then there's the financial
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
piece so that is correct there is going
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
to be the financial implication for the
 
01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
application process if we we are
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
accepted into the the program so because
 
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
of the way we utilize our free and
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
reduced numbers it has impacts across
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
the board whereas um other states in
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
comparison that may not use their free
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
and reduce numbers for their adequacy
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
may not have the same sort of um uh kind
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
of issues or attachments or things that
 
01:15:20.189 --> 01:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
kind of impact one another um but
 
01:15:22.110 --> 01:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
because of the way we utilize it across
 
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
the board across multiple programs yes
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
that they they come as a package deal so
 
01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
I apologize for if I wasn't clear
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
earlier but thank you Mr chair and again
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here we really
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate your you know information and
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
support so am I on am I what happens is
 
01:15:42.189 --> 01:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
the application binding that would be my
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
first quick question once we apply we
 
01:15:47.950 --> 01:15:47.960 align:start position:0%
are committed to going through if we get
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
approved or is the application just a
 
01:15:52.629 --> 01:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
you allowed to negotiate a deal and then
 
01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
not um from the USDA standpoint um is
 
01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
what I I can speak to for that um is
 
01:16:07.149 --> 01:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
that if we apply and we get approved for
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.550 --> 01:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
realistically back when um I believe
 
01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
this was about two or three years ago um
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
we and I just want wanted to make this
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
clear also is that as the Department um
 
01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:27.159 align:start position:0%
this program would not have been
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
something that we would have had to come
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
to legislative for to asked permission
 
01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
we could have um applied for the program
 
01:16:37.229 --> 01:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
however there was legislation that was
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
put forward that didn't pass therefore
 
01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
we couldn't apply for the program
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
because we could not go around the
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
legislation um so I just wanted to be to
 
01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
be clear um on that so when we apply for
 
01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
this program
 
01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
um the you can you are approved for it
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
um and then we we from the USDA
 
01:17:00.189 --> 01:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
standpoint side and getting the federal
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
funding for that can start to operate
 
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
the program unless there are other um
 
01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
statutes or or um regulations that are
 
01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
put in place that we would need to then
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
come back and take the next step does
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
that I'm good thank you I think the
 
01:17:21.629 --> 01:17:21.639 align:start position:0%
question is you said we can move forward
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
do we have to move forward
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
if we apply for the program and we're
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
approved can it be provisional to say
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
well now we have to see how it affects
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
the the the state overall and withdraw
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
from the program that was that would be
 
01:17:36.669 --> 01:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
something that I can ask youda I don't I
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:58.750 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:17:58.750 --> 01:17:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
I just wanted uh to again I'm Laura
 
01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
milikin from New Hampshire hunger
 
01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
Solutions um I just wanted to throw out
 
01:18:08.629 --> 01:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
that that USDA does or at least in the
 
01:18:11.629 --> 01:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
last cycle they did allow for a portion
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
of alas to be a part of the pilot it
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
does not have to be the whole state um
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
the scope could either be um all schools
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
or um a portion so uh it it's possible
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
pleasure I just in case you know I
 
01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
thought I made a motion at the beginning
 
01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
but if the motion wasn't made at the
 
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
beginning I'd like to make a motion to
 
01:18:52.629 --> 01:18:52.639 align:start position:0%
IDL 601 have okay motions made in second
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
and fr for
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
favor those
 
01:19:03.629 --> 01:19:03.639 align:start position:0%
opposed 54 so we'll recommend out to the
 
01:19:07.350 --> 01:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
full finance committee of itl and I'm
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
sure we'll have a little more
 
01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
discussion okay this has been very
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
educational and and I think to to
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
Murray's point we seem to be there's a
 
01:19:25.790 --> 01:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
lot of universes cross in here and I
 
01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
think we all agree we want to not have
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
hungry kids but this didn't look like
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
the solution toour so all right moving
 
01:19:36.239 --> 01:19:38.070 align:start position:0%
the solution toour so all right moving
moving

01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
moving
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
620 to set up an establishing an early
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
learning Department Early Learning
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
Education pilot
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
program right and you're the sponsor I
 
01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
am okay and if I may please I would like
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
to um make a motion to interim study
 
01:20:08.189 --> 01:20:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
620 we have a motion for interim study
 
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
does anybody is there a
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
second okay represent Mery
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
seconds would you like to make your case
 
01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
I would like to make my case um there is
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
a similar bill in the Senate right now
 
01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
um and I have been approached by the New
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire terriable trust and the cut
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
Foundation they're very interested in
 
01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
the work that's being done here um
 
01:20:37.229 --> 01:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
there's work going on at Health and
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
Human Services I don't think we're ready
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
to go forward with this program per se
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
but giving us time to seek more
 
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
information um I would connect with
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley she's um I believe
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
Mickey if I'm correct she is interim
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
studying the same bill in the Senate so
 
01:20:59.629 --> 01:20:59.639 align:start position:0%
we would um use our joint efforts uh a
 
01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
committee here which I would be happy to
 
01:21:03.790 --> 01:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
chair um and come back with a report to
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
the full committee and at that point in
 
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
time it would be only a recommendation
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
either to move forward or not to
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
continue so um I would hope that we
 
01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
could at least invest the time in doing
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
a short-term interim study and come out
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
with a report relative to um this
 
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
program question yes um thank you for
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative Heath
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
um would that interim study also provide
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to consider the fiscal
 
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
ramifications of An Early Childhood
 
01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.270 align:start position:0%
ramifications of An Early Childhood
Program

01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
Program
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think that information as a
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
followup um Mr chair I think that
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
information could be really helpful in
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
terms of determining whether or not a
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
program um which you know we could
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
determine this the magnitude of the size
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
how many students and you know what
 
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
those fiscal ramifications will be for
 
01:21:57.390 --> 01:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
our state I think that's really
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
important knowledge to determine whether
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
or not this is something um we can
 
01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
achieve and um you know what the need is
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to right now doing
 
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
interim study talk about the
 
01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:16.600 align:start position:0%
process what that means is that we will
 
01:22:19.390 --> 01:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
have to reconvene in the fall in order
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
to report out the results of the interim
 
01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.310 align:start position:0%
to report out the results of the interim
study

01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
in as much as you are the sponsor of
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
this bill and you want to run the
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
interim study I got a pretty strong
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
feeling of what that report's going to
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
be so my question is from from a process
 
01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
standpoint do you need the interim study
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
to do all the things you just said you C
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
you can meet with the Senate you can do
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
all the things you just said not worry
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
about I mean forget 620 the concept
 
01:22:52.149 --> 01:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
moving forward for NE it's not going to
 
01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
happen this this year so it's going I
 
01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
mean this term it's going to be next
 
01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.350 align:start position:0%
mean this term it's going to be next
term

01:22:58.350 --> 01:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
term
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
so that's I can I respond yeah
 
01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
um when if in fact we recommend going
 
01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
forward with the interim study we're
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%
saying that we want to look further into
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
the possibilities of this bill by iing
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
it we are changing our status the house
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
passed this on the floor um if we choose
 
01:23:31.709 --> 01:23:31.719 align:start position:0%
now at this point to itl it we are now
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
taking away the um approval that we had
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
once provided for this and that's
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
sending kind of two different messages
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm willing to do the work if if we
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
can just interim study there's no
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
funding attached to this right now we
 
01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:51.560 align:start position:0%
would be able we have no figures yet
 
01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Ved in terms of
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
what this would cost um Health and Human
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
Services is working right now
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want um representative
 
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
um uh M Jane would you have any comments
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
that you'd want to make based on your
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
work with um Health and Human
 
01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:14.950 align:start position:0%
work with um Health and Human
Services

01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:24:18.189 --> 01:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
no if if you would be okay if You' like
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:30.390 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
turn your mic
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
on the um idea of a pre kindergarten
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
program for New Hampshire children has
 
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
been going on for for quite a while um
 
01:24:44.669 --> 01:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
and I think the idea of having an
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
interim study to really start to take a
 
01:24:50.229 --> 01:24:50.239 align:start position:0%
look at what does it mean financially I
 
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
don't think we've really done that right
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
now the Department of Health and Human
 
01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
Services does have a pilot program that
 
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
they are running but it is very small in
 
01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:03.400 align:start position:0%
just um a couple of locations so it's
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
not it's not going to give us really the
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
kind of information that you might get
 
01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
from an interm study so that as we look
 
01:25:12.109 --> 01:25:12.119 align:start position:0%
at this in the future we'll have some
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
better data so so I would hope that we
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
could do an interim study and I think
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
representative Heath indicates she's
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
willing to put the time in and the work
 
01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:25.629 align:start position:0%
willing to put the time in and the work
in

01:25:25.629 --> 01:25:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
K it came to us with the policy
 
01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
decided we had to find the money we
 
01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
didn't have any estimates from the
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed so we kind of stifled
 
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
an interim study what would that prove
 
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
we still wouldn't find the money the
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
policy's been decided I hearken back to
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
many years ago Head Start similar
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
program parents with toddlers loved it
 
01:25:57.790 --> 01:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
saved a lot of daycare money but then
 
01:25:59.709 --> 01:25:59.719 align:start position:0%
they went on a did a study 20 years
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
later after they started Head Start and
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
said was a waste of
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
money those children didn't learn any
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
better going forward than the ones that
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
were staying at home and then finally
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
went to kindergarten so it's a lot of
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
money that's going to save people for
 
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
babysitting and all the ones that that
 
01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
are have little children are crazy about
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
it but it's a lot of money for nothing
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's what that study found out about
 
01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
Head Start that's why we don't hear any
 
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
more money any more talk about Head
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
Start so what would you do in interim
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
study all you can do is say where's the
 
01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
money the policy's been decided I'm
 
01:26:39.149 --> 01:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
against interim study thank
 
01:26:43.390 --> 01:26:43.400 align:start position:0%
you yes well thank you Mr chair I I just
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
would like to follow up those comments
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
with um a reminder to the committee that
 
01:26:49.950 --> 01:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
we have not seen any fiscal information
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
from the state so to make blank get
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
declarations without a citation to a a
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
reputable source for whether or not this
 
01:27:02.109 --> 01:27:02.119 align:start position:0%
would cost money stands to be you know
 
01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
critiqued and that I think you know it's
 
01:27:07.470 --> 01:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
Our obligation to consider the data and
 
01:27:09.790 --> 01:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
if we don't have it an inm study is a
 
01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:12.280 align:start position:0%
great way to find that data to reach out
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
to The Experts to combine that
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
information and to put it on the record
 
01:27:18.430 --> 01:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
so that we have information to make a
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
sound decision off of um
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
so you know I think it's an important
 
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
and worthwhile cause to consider our
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
state has obviously been thinking about
 
01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
it for a while and that an interim study
 
01:27:33.629 --> 01:27:33.639 align:start position:0%
motion does present the opportunity for
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
our state to further um that mission and
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
to find the data that will back up the
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal that we are here to consider so
 
01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:42.950 align:start position:0%
fiscal that we are here to consider so
thank

01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair as a freshman uh
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
what timeline do we have if an interim
 
01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
study happens when would it have to be
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
concluded it's my first term so I really
 
01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:53.870 align:start position:0%
concluded it's my first term so I really
don't

01:27:53.870 --> 01:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
know I think we have to report up by
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
November 1st so if we which November 1
 
01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:01.350 align:start position:0%
November 1st so if we which November 1
because

01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
it's okay no so my point is that if we
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
didn't get the data in the many months
 
01:28:10.390 --> 01:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
we've been waiting for it what data are
 
01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
we going to get in the next two weeks
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
that will justify interim studying it I
 
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
mean seriously what are the odds and
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
without data what's the point of interim
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
starting because we seem to all agree
 
01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
that the data is needed and
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's not I'm talking about next year
 
01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
next year oh next year a full year well
 
01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
there you go thank
 
01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
you yes and there are agencies right now
 
01:28:38.189 --> 01:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
that are very committed to looking at a
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
pre program in the state of New
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're willing to participate
 
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
and provide information Health and Human
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
Services is C currently um working on a
 
01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
pilot that will bring some more
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
information and I think some of the
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
information that can be brought forward
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
by places like the New Hampshire
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
charitable trust the CCH Foundation can
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
provide information that we previously
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have that we can apply to what an
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
overall cost would be so I don't see any
 
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
harm in an interim study there's no
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
dollars attached to it we'd be pulling
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
in people that that would be willing to
 
01:29:18.910 --> 01:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
help us um look at this and come up with
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
some recommendations we have till
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
November 1st 24 um and I think that
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
gives us time to come up with a good
 
01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
report that we can provide to you I see
 
01:29:33.310 --> 01:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
no harm and no dollars
 
01:29:38.189 --> 01:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
um I see more benefit than than harm
 
01:29:38.199 --> 01:29:39.189 align:start position:0%
um I see more benefit than than harm
thank

01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
you okay so a motion been made and
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
favor okay four four in favor all
 
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
opposed five so we'll report out to full
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
Finance itl for in
 
01:30:00.189 --> 01:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
study anything else before the committee
 
01:30:03.629 --> 01:30:03.639 align:start position:0%
I I you I gave you all are you actually
 
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
Janet did a document looks like
 
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
this that we're going to it's for next
 
01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
week we're back here next Tuesday for
 
01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:17.270 align:start position:0%
week we're back here next Tuesday for
full

01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
full
 
01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
Finance is it appropriate for us to make
 
01:30:21.950 --> 01:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
a formal vote for the itl because I I
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe there was a formal motion
 
01:30:24.830 --> 01:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to be passing that
 
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation forward I think we
 
01:30:27.870 --> 01:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
probably should have a vote on the
