00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
no meeting on the topic and therefore uh
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
based on not really delving into the
 
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
subject I'd like to uh not recommend it
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
for future
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
legislation okay do I hear any other
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
discussion on representative Murray uh
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair though there
 
00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
wasn't a meeting um yet um I do believe
 
00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
it is possible that we could uh recess
 
00:26:56.389 --> 00:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
this potentially and have a hearing
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
excuse me a meeting and uh the acting
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
deadline uh if I'm not wrong is the
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
20 uh 4th um is that a possibility to do
 
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
so well then that would require the full
 
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
committee to come in once more to vote
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
to recommend for future legislation or
 
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
not and that would be I think kind of um
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
an inconvenience for most members to do
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
so um I believe that there
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby I believe that
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
there that um in order to vote to
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation a um a
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting is actually not
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
required in order to do
 
00:27:47.919 --> 00:27:51.149 align:start position:0%
required in order to do
that

00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh personally I would have liked to
 
00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
have had some in-depth study of the
 
00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.029 align:start position:0%
have had some in-depth study of the
subject

00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
subject
 
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh so that some information could be
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
brought to the full committee I mean I I
 
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
get that you know you don't have to but
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
I mean for the nature of doing an
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
interim study I I think that we would be
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
remiss in making a recommendation
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
without actually having done some kind
 
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
of study for that
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
bill um representative
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
Duty uh yes can you clarify the process
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
I mean it was my understanding that each
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee had a chair and that it was
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
the chair's responsibility to call a
 
00:28:35.389 --> 00:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
meeting that meeting was called but
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a Corum I don't what
 
00:28:38.909 --> 00:28:38.919 align:start position:0%
happened the meeting was never called no
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
meeting okay okay representative
 
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
gerana thank you madam chair I would
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
just like to to say uh that you know
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we didn't have that
 
00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:52.830 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we didn't have that
subcommittee

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
meeting I continued to do research on on
 
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
the bill I was a co-sponsor of
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
amendments that were offered that we
 
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
talked about in committee but Dees did
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
not have enough time to uh to evaluate
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
those uh those amendments and I wanted
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
to pass out to uh everyone as a reminder
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
discussed that was presented in
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
amendments and in particular Madame
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
chair asked some very good questions
 
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
about how certain potential harmful
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
impacts would be would be measured
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh so one of the things that we are are
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
hoping to do with with an amended bill
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
is to have the Department of
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services weigh potential
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
benefits which is currently in RSA with
 
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
potential harms which is not in RSA uh
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
and uh what I have provided to the to
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
the committee by email is a link to the
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
federal government the Department of
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
Transportation federal ederal Highway
 
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
administration's website which shows
 
00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:02.919 align:start position:0%
that the federal government has been
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
doing this since 1969 so more than 55
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
years the federal government has been
 
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:12.559 align:start position:0%
weighing exactly the specific kinds of
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
potential harms that you know we have
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
offered that we hope would go into
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
future legislation so there is a long
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
history of being able to calculate and
 
00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
quantify measure and balance uh the
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
specific things that uh we are offering
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
as part of the net public benefit in in
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
an amended
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
bill I appreciate that and I you're and
 
00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:38.039 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate the work that you may
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
have done um to follow up with this
 
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
legislation unfortunately I mean I
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
received that information last night
 
00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
have no have had no time to review it at
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
all and I mean even even the this paper
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
that you're passing out I'm just seeing
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
this now so
 
00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.990 align:start position:0%
this now so
you

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
know I I just think that since there
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
really hasn't been any kind of um you
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
know subcommitte meeting to really delve
 
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
into what kinds of things could be done
 
00:31:14.509 --> 00:31:14.519 align:start position:0%
should be done shouldn't be done uh you
 
00:31:16.509 --> 00:31:16.519 align:start position:0%
know we really don't have as as a
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
committee really have enough information
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
to recomend Future legislation on this
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
um who
 
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
who representative
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
representative um Murray thank you madam
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
no that's okay I I do want to H say that
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
I do think that we have heard in
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
previous testimony um a large um set of
 
00:31:45.629 --> 00:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
findings that really um spoke to the the
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
need for there being a conversation on
 
00:31:51.149 --> 00:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
what net public benefit actually means
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
and how that is quantifiable and I think
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
that we um as a group um did have
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
lengthy disc discussions on the subject
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
matter um I am happy
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
to um note that while while there may
 
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
have not been a subcommittee hearing on
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
the issue this the underlying issue
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
still remain the same that we heard in
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
testimony representative
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
kamto thank you madam chair and I
 
00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:20.519 align:start position:0%
appreciate what everyone is saying but
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
this committee did vote for an inim
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
study because we wanted more information
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
and without that forthcoming I cannot
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
vote for future legislation
 
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins with respect
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
this is a very important subject and the
 
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
information that I've been hearing and
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
reading without doing specific research
 
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
is replete across the media so I think
 
00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
that it would be a shame not to move
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
this forward for future legislation
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
because it is about public health it is
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
it is ex intrinsically important to to
 
00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
the issues that many of us care about so
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly going to vote in favor
 
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
Katon thank you madam chair I guess the
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
way I look at this is we as a committee
 
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
looked at this last spring and we
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
decided that it needed a little bit more
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
work and there was not
 
00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh work done on it uh as as we had
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
agreed uh although I see the value of
 
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
the bill and there's portion of the
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
bills um
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
I think we had an agreement with each
 
00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
other that we' look at it and we'd study
 
00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
a little bit more and we didn't do that
 
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
that being said uh as representative Jam
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
stated there's there is precedent for
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
this and if there is a separate bill
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
then that bill can be fired separately
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
but I think as a
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
committee um we've not done what we said
 
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:50.120 align:start position:0%
we were going to do and we don't have
 
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
additional information and so I would
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
vote not to recommend it since we have
 
00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
not done our due diligence
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
however I would be glad to look at a
 
00:34:03.549 --> 00:34:03.559 align:start position:0%
bill that took a part subsets or or
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
whatever of this and proposed new
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
legislation I think that would be a
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
over representative uh n yeah um thank
 
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I just have a question
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
for you our representative Bixby as to
 
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
um as a sort of new still new legislator
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
um if we recommend the this for future
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
legislation then the committee would
 
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
work on that legislation versus if
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
somebody filed this if someone was to
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
file new legislation related to this
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
this fall what is the difference between
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
us recommending it for future
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
legislation and as representative kryon
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
said um filing related legislation this
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so um
 
00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:49.879 align:start position:0%
functionally there is no difference uh
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
so uh the recommendation of a when we
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
voted interim study we basically killed
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
the bill for this term and
 
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
no no the actions of one term can't bind
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
the next term so um the only thing that
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
um an a a recommendation for future
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
legislation would do would um provide a
 
00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of a um sort of moral boost
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have but it has
 
00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely no legal bearing whatsoever
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
on what comes forward for another bill
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
so if the commit if we don't recommend
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
for future legislation on this then um I
 
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
think that the next step would be to uh
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
for all those who are interested in this
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill to work with uh Nick on sponsoring
 
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:40.280 align:start position:0%
it for next
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
term yep representative ger thank you uh
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
I I understand kind of the argument
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
that's being made I appreciate it that
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
we recommended it for interim study
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the interim study didn't
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
happen uh I do just want to point out
 
00:35:58.589 --> 00:35:58.599 align:start position:0%
however that when we're when if the
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
committee were to vote in favor of
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
future Rec future legislation that's not
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
a vote in favor of specific future
 
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation that's not an endorsement
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
of the specific language in the original
 
00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
bill or of the amendment right a vote in
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
favor of future legislation is a
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
recognition that what we have now is a
 
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
system that makes no sense what we have
 
00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:20.599 align:start position:0%
now is a system in which making a
 
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
decision you draw up a pro list and not
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
a con list and what we should have a
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
system that requires us to draw up a pro
 
00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:30.440 align:start position:0%
list and a con list and to balance those
 
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
two to determine where we go from there
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
in my mind that's all a vote in favor of
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
recommending future legislation does it
 
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
says that this committee agrees that
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
legislation that requires a net public
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis is the direction that
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
we should be going without endorsing any
 
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
specific language or approach thank you
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
represent Duty uh yes thank you madam
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
chair uh yes I would vote in favor of uh
 
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:02.839 align:start position:0%
What uh representative germano said in
 
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
terms of future legislation and the
 
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
reason for that is I went through to
 
00:37:10.309 --> 00:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
many of the dees uh meetings regarding
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
the ashalt plant in naswa and my
 
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of the way the law is now
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
okay the only input a resident can have
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
is is based on scientific information
 
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
that they can dispute or support uh
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
during that that meeting in other words
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
they can't bring in issues like noise
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
pollution they can't bring in uh they
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
couldn't bring in issues of um diesel
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
fuel for from trucks that were idling
 
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:43.640 align:start position:0%
because that was outside the purview of
 
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
the scientific data um and I think this
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
bill uh supports the fact that um
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
individuals should be able to come
 
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
forward and put those arguments forth um
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
because it does affect their daily life
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
so I uh believe in the concept of this
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
bill and I would want to see this
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
concept going forward uh in the next
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
session okay thank you any other
 
00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
comment seeing none I'd like the uh
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on the the uh
 
00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:19.309 align:start position:0%

00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
1351 prohibiting the sale and use of

adhesive based rodent traps and I would
 
00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
uh request that chair of um The
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee Who reviewed that um bill
 
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
or discussed that bill uh representative
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
Bixby please um give your subcommittee's
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
recommend ation on that uh the
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee recommended on a 4 to1 vote
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
that uh we do not proceed with further
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
legislation uh
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
and uh the basis for that was
 
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
essentially that uh we didn't see what
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh we didn't see what that what that LE
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
potential legislation would actually
 
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
look like and there was not a proposal
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
that was different than what the
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
previous legislation that did not um
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
get approval was okay thank you would
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
you like to uh uh make a motion oh
 
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.990 align:start position:0%
you like to uh uh make a motion oh
um

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
I I guess I as as as chair of that
 
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I will um move what the
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee recommended which is not to
 
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
to recommend no further legislation okay
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
represent kto I'll second that thank you
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh any discussion on that representative
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
H Haskins yes thank you you um as the
 
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
dissenting vote I have to say that I did
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
a pretty poor job of presenting my
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
um opinion about this topic oh you never
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
do a poor
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
job thank you um I think a lot of it had
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
to do with the fact that I really didn't
 
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
understand what interim study was and
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
I've had this conversation with
 
00:42:24.549 --> 00:42:24.559 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby who was equally
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
kind about it but I don't feel very good
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:42:33.309 --> 00:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
um nevertheless I think that this topic
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
about which there is much new
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
information remains what I called it
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
originally a 19th century solution to a
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
rodent problem I introduced the idea
 
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
which some of you already know
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
contraception for rodents which is a
 
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
indeed 21st century um option for this
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
topic um
 
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
I also said that there is indeed
 
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:04.839 align:start position:0%
evidence that unintended animals are
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
being caught in these glut traps that
 
00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
they are inhumane they represent torture
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
fish and game is against them there's a
 
00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony by wildlife sanctuaries
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
that work with the critters that get
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
caught on these things and it just it
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
strikes me that we can do better than
 
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
that which is why I voted um for future
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
legislation which I surely will be part
 
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:33.640 align:start position:0%
of thank you for that um I would just
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
like to add um before I go to
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative com's comments
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
um that yes I mean I see that
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
contraception and that there are other
 
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
means by which to control rodents but
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
with regard to the glue traps
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
themselves um I believe that you know
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
personally I just don't want to
 
00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:57.750 align:start position:0%
personally I just don't want to
eliminate

00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
a non-chemical form of rodent control
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
from the toolbox of those who can use it
 
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
and places that have
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
been um ens snaring non-targeted species
 
00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
simply have been using them in the wrong
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
places that they should not so I mean I
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
I I I I also agree that um for for
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
purposes of uh prohibiting adhesive base
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
rodent traps I would support um no on
 
00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
future legislation and representative
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
kto you had some comments thank you
 
00:44:33.839 --> 00:44:34.750 align:start position:0%
kto you had some comments thank you
madam

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
madam
 
00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.069 align:start position:0%
madam
chair

00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
so you know I as I discussed in our inim
 
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
study I was at a farm bureau meeting and
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
we were discussing different ways to
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
control rodents obviously contraception
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
came up as one of the ideas and was
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that it is working so that
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
is an
 
00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
option however
 
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
they want more options and when I hear
 
00:45:04.549 --> 00:45:04.559 align:start position:0%
and I'm not disputing the fact that
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
adhesive traps may be using Outdoors
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
it's really hard for me to understand
 
00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
how that stickiness is uh if you get
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
sand on it or anything it basically you
 
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:19.720 align:start position:0%
know nothing really sticks to it um um I
 
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
went out after that hearing and
 
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
purchased uh one of
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
the non-toxic organic that was highly
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
recommended that I was told that worked
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
100% that the person no longer had any
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
rodents at their home I mean not only I
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
scrubbed the area I triple sprayed
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
everything and it did not
 
00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.349 align:start position:0%
everything and it did not
work

00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
um because I wanted to see if in true
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
there was another option for me to
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
use it was
 
00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
not um sticky traps is only one tool in
 
00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:57.470 align:start position:0%
not um sticky traps is only one tool in
the

00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
toolbox we are getting ready I think
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
that we understand that the second
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
generation coagulants are going to not
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
be able to be used by individuals so
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
you're eliminating another tool for
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
controlling rodents rodents are a public
 
00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.150 align:start position:0%
controlling rodents rodents are a public
health

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:15.160 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
Menace and we need to have all the
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
non-toxic Tools in our
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
toolbox uh to be able to control them in
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
and around our Farms our feed our homes
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
and I think as you're seeing so you know
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
we had the discussion some people at
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
that meeting were like oh no I would
 
00:46:38.109 --> 00:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
never use them and we're like great and
 
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
other people are like we really need it
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
as a tool so people already have the
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
option of whether they want to use them
 
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
or not um so I think that eliminating a
 
00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.030 align:start position:0%
or not um so I think that eliminating a
non-toxic

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
non-toxic
 
00:46:54.549 --> 00:46:54.559 align:start position:0%
uh way to control them would be
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
detrimental in a lot of instances
 
00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.910 align:start position:0%
detrimental in a lot of instances
thank

00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:01.000 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you madam chair um I have two
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
points to make unfortunately I was not
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
able to attend the subcommittee meeting
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
but I did um uh provide uh the chair
 
00:47:16.589 --> 00:47:16.599 align:start position:0%
representative uh Bixby with some of U
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
my concerns and ideas uh one of the
 
00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
things that I think we should be doing
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
is we should be putting a label on all
 
00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
of those packages that that basically
 
00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:30.079 align:start position:0%
say uh this product has been deemed uh
 
00:47:33.309 --> 00:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
inhumane for uh wildlife and may
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
inadvertently catch uh pets or whatever
 
00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
you know uh in the Trap I think to put
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
some type of a warning label on it so
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
the consumer knows that Wildlife
 
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
organizations do consider this to be an
 
00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
inhumane treatment uh I would be helpful
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't ban the product uh
 
00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
secondly okay secondly uh and and that
 
00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
has hasn't been discussed here so I just
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring it up secondly I
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
recently uh watched a webinar um that
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
was Raptors um as a biological weapon
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
against rats and in that they indicated
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
that one Raptor will eat three rats a
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
day and that barn owls that my
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
understanding are we do not have in this
 
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
area for you know um uh for perpetuity
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
because of the cold Winters but barn
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
owls eat5 100 rats a year yet what we do
 
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
is we have escar okay that in infect the
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
rats that eat it the Raptors eat the rat
 
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
and then we kill the Raptors because of
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
of what they've eaten so we're
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
inadvertently killing the uh non-toxic
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
remedy that we have and it seems to me
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
that uh Farms are a perfect environment
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
you know for um for Raptors
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know all about it but I know
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
I guess what they're saying is you know
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
if you want Raptors put a raptor perch
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
in your yard or on your land and you'll
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
get Raptors um so I think those are some
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
of the things that we should be thinking
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
about and talking about and you know I
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
um would agree with representative H
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
Haskins and I would vote um for moving
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
this legislation along not this
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation but the
 
00:49:27.309 --> 00:49:27.319 align:start position:0%
concept and I do think labor in is a
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
place to start representative
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
kto thank you madam chair um and
 
00:49:35.549 --> 00:49:35.559 align:start position:0%
representative Duty thank you uh for
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
that um I do have Raptors um I get to
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
I'm one of the very fortunate people and
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
I get to watch them uh sore The Thermals
 
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
um when I'm outside um and I watch them
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
go down and get the rodents and
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
everything and it does help but it
 
00:49:59.710 --> 00:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
isn't the O It's not 100% solution um
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
and once they're in your home or in a
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
building those Raptors can't get to
 
00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
those rodents and that's why we need the
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
uh the tools in the
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
toolbox representative
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
Kenny um I agree that Raptors will go to
 
00:50:21.789 --> 00:50:21.799 align:start position:0%
uh eat rodents but when you have
 
00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:25.799 align:start position:0%
chickens chickens are easy targets so I
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
do not want r Raptors around my chicken
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
Coupe cuz I've lost too many hens to
 
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
Raptors so I agree we need tools in the
 
00:50:38.789 --> 00:50:38.799 align:start position:0%
toolbox thank you representative H
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair the tool
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
in the toolbox argument is interesting I
 
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
would wager that when they introduce
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
second generation
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
anti-coagulants anti is that yeah scars
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
I'll call them scars it's easier to
 
00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
remember they said it was a necessary
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
tool in the toolbox and now the federal
 
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
government is prepared to say it's a
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
lethal tool so we don't want it in the
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
toolbox I would say if we have to label
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
something as even potentially
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
inhumane why are we selling it if it's
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
inhumane so I respect the fact that um
 
00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
my colleague and friend Duty uh
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
representative Duty um suggests that the
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
labeling might be the way to go but
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
that's what I get stuck on not to make a
 
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
pun that was inadvertent that if they
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
are inhumane we shouldn't be selling
 
00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799 align:start position:0%
them again the 20 first century is
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
offering us Solutions we need not when
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
we know better we have to do better we
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
need not go back to this ancient way of
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
capturing mice kittens whoever ever
 
00:51:59.309 --> 00:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
winds up on these glue traps I just
 
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that we're still talking
 
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:04.799 align:start position:0%
about them yeah thank you I I'm I I am
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
aware that um from the from the box that
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh representative ktoa brought in that
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
there there is labeling on these um on
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
these items that say do not use these in
 
00:52:19.549 --> 00:52:19.559 align:start position:0%
open places that they should be enclosed
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
indoors used indoors where um Birds
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
kittens snakes whatever would not be
 
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
the non-targeted species would not be
 
00:52:31.789 --> 00:52:31.799 align:start position:0%
involved so I think you know for
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
purposes of labeling we already have
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
labels on them and I think that there is
 
00:52:41.789 --> 00:52:41.799 align:start position:0%
um probably a good public
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
education effort going on as to you know
 
00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:47.559 align:start position:0%
people's perception of it being inhumane
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
or cruel so there are people who are not
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
buying them simply because they agree
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
with that um but there are people who
 
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
are buying them and using them because
 
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
it is a means by which they can control
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
the rodent population without the use of
 
00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
chemicals food safety you know food uh
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
preparation places um schools um places
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
where you don't want
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
chemicals involved and to ban that
 
00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:22.799 align:start position:0%
completely I think would be a big
 
00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
mistake because it does have a use it
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
does have a place
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
and um people just need to know better
 
00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:34.799 align:start position:0%
how to implement these kinds of um these
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
kinds of control methods so that's my
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
thought on that any other discussion or
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
can we go to the
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
vote I represent dsy just say quickly
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
for rodents indoors you have cats okay
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
and and they are and I have three cats
 
00:53:52.829 --> 00:53:52.839 align:start position:0%
they are very effective I don't have if
 
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
I have any rodents in the house it's
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
rodents they bring in we catch them and
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh take them outside that's number one
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
the other two the labeling that they
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
have right now doesn't specifically say
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
that per Wildlife organizations this
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
product is considered inhumane and
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
that's different I mean look at what
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
they did with cigarettes this product
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
may cause cancer boom you still want to
 
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
smoke you kin we're not Banning
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
cigarettes but this product may cause
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
cancer and I would say the same thing
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
this product is deemed
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
inhumane to Wildlife by conservation
 
00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
organizations you can still buy it you
 
00:54:37.630 --> 00:54:37.640 align:start position:0%
can still use it but I think that's much
 
00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
more effective than saying you know be
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
careful where you put this okay thank
 
00:54:44.109 --> 00:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
you for
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
that uh representative Bixby um not all
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
cats are very good
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
mousers we have we we currently have one
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
cat we had two cats siblings um
 
00:54:59.150 --> 00:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
they would play catch and
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
release and the mouse might or might not
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
survive but um you know one mouse that
 
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
has been thoroughly played out over the
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
course of two days uh I'm not sure that
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
a glue trap is any worse than
 
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
that okay um I would like the clerk to
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
like a round table almost for our inum
 
00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
study um a uh good presentation from uh
 
00:58:59.549 --> 00:58:59.559 align:start position:0%
DHHS and a lot of good information came
 
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
out of this um hearing that we had and a
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
lot of great ideas uh DHHS has already
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
come up with some ideas as uh
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative eron just said as along
 
00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
with some others um we found some holes
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
in the law and some loopholes that um
 
00:59:22.109 --> 00:59:22.119 align:start position:0%
are some things that really need to be
 
00:59:24.670 --> 00:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
corrected uh to make it easier for
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
people to uh produce in their kitchen
 
00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
and um you know we knew that this bill
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
itself was not ready for prime time but
 
00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
because of the interim study uh a lot of
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
great ideas have come forth and I think
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
it'll have an impact on people in New
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you representative Bixby
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
yeah um I I unfortunately I was not able
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
to make it to that uh subcommittee
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
meeting but um I've sort of been looking
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
at the the process and looking at uh
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
who's been involved in it and uh my my
 
01:00:01.829 --> 01:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
feeling is that uh as long as we involve
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh food Protective Services in the
 
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
drafting of the bill so that uh we know
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
that that we're putting together
 
01:00:08.829 --> 01:00:08.839 align:start position:0%
something that they would feel
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable enforcing I would be uh I I
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
would strongly encourage this sort of
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you any other
 
01:00:21.029 --> 01:00:21.039 align:start position:0%
comments then I would oh represent
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
NAB um I just have a question for the
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is so is this essentially a
 
01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:27.640 align:start position:0%
brand dat rebranding of the idea of
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
Homestead Foods is that the big picture
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
goal of this um no but there
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
will the ideas that were discussed was
 
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
to uh work on
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
expanding um some of the food offerings
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
that our local producers can produce and
 
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
sell um and how they sell them to make
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
it easier for them to to sell them um so
 
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
you know I I think the the whole notion
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
of really um balancing risk management
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh with food production versus food born
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
illness is really at the Crux of what
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
we've been looking at and um so I think
 
01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
that I don't know if that answers your
 
01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:22.039 align:start position:0%
question but yeah okay another aspect of
 
01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
it is that uh the way that the both the
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
statutes and the regulations are written
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
right now it's uh very it's fairly
 
01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
confusing for people who want to get
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
involved in it and it's not a matter of
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
branding it's a matter of making the
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
procedures more straightforward and more
 
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
aligned with what people can actually do
 
01:01:47.029 --> 01:01:47.039 align:start position:0%
so for instance one suggestion was uh
 
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
there there exists a um an occasional
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
food producer program where you can
 
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
without um further licensing you can
 
01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
produce food for uh for sale in your
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
home at the moment uh under uh four
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
times a month four times in in 30 days
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that was brought
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
up was was well if that's four times in
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
30 days then it is not you can't
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
establish a weekly schedule like I'm
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
going to have this available every
 
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
Wednesday uh so uh by doing things like
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
shifting that to 28 days it makes it
 
01:02:30.269 --> 01:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
that makes it possible for people to uh
 
01:02:32.829 --> 01:02:32.839 align:start position:0%
do it more effectively and so and that
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
that's just one example of the sorts of
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
tweaks in existing statutes and
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
regulations that could make a lot easier
 
01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:41.319 align:start position:0%
for people to do
 
01:02:46.589 --> 01:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
it I agree okay totally agree on that if
 
01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to put in a bill on that
 
01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.109 align:start position:0%
you're going to put in a bill on that
I'll

01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
I'll
 
01:02:51.109 --> 01:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor this was part of what you
 
01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
suggest yeah yeah yeah yeah
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh anyone any other
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
