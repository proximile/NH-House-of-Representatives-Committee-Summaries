Peak there
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
this this amendment
 
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.370 align:start position:0%
this this amendment
um

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:48.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
is a revision of the amendment that I
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
sent out and it's nine of
 
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I shared that I
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
and when I reviewed
 
00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:10.019 align:start position:0%
um that there were some minor questions
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
that I had about it but I did want to to
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
share that Amendment with the committee
 
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
so that you had enough time to to look
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
at it closely
 
00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.449 align:start position:0%
at it closely
so

00:15:20.449 --> 00:15:20.459 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
um the next day on Tuesday I contacted
 
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
OLS to have a discussion when I had
 
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
representative L word and I had worked
 
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
very diligently on this amendment and
 
00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.090 align:start position:0%
very diligently on this amendment and
um

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
I had submitted the changes that I
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
wanted made and um
 
00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there was there were some
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
things that needed to be addressed that
 
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
were not included so what I'm going to
 
00:15:53.569 --> 00:15:53.579 align:start position:0%
do first is I'm going to go through very
 
00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
systematically and explain and outline
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
um the changes to the original bill
 
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:04.139 align:start position:0%
that this amendment represents
 
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:07.019 align:start position:0%
so the first thing is on the cover page
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
which is not included with this
 
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
amendment but you will see it on the
 
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.790 align:start position:0%
amendment but you will see it on the
bill

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
that was received by the Senate the
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
analysis was updated to reflect the
 
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
changes made within the body of the bill
 
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:26.339 align:start position:0%
so if on the amendment if you look at
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
you'll you will see the the amended
 
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.189 align:start position:0%
you'll you will see the the amended
analysis

00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
and that would appear on the cover page
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
of a bill
 
00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:41.579 align:start position:0%
so the second change in this amendment
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
is on page one line three
 
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
um an act is also amended to read
 
00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:52.259 align:start position:0%
prohibiting cities and towns from
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
adopting restrictive policies
 
00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
on the same page line seven the short
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
title was also amended to read this act
 
00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
shall be known as the secure New
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire communities Act
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
page one line eight the subdivision
 
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
title is amended to reflect the new
 
00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
short title
 
00:17:20.929 --> 00:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
page one line ten The Heading is
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
similarly amended
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
to reflect the new short title
 
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
page one line 21.
 
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:30.620 align:start position:0%
in the amendment
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
1960 for some unknown reason there was a
 
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
word was flipped
 
00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:39.049 align:start position:0%
word was flipped
so

00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
um the word in that Amendment
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
they changed it from detainer to
 
00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.669 align:start position:0%
they changed it from detainer to
detainee

00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
detainee
 
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
so this amendment
 
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
1983 changes it back correctly
 
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.289 align:start position:0%
1983 changes it back correctly
to

00:17:54.289 --> 00:17:54.299 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:54.299 --> 00:17:55.010 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
detain detainer
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
then on page two
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
it would be Roman numeral section 7
 
00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
um there's significant changes in that
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
and those changes reflect simplified
 
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:21.900 align:start position:0%
language in order to make this bill more
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
narrow and explicit and representative L
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
word will speak in Greater detail
 
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.230 align:start position:0%
word will speak in Greater detail
um

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
to that section then on page 2 line 24
 
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
in 1960 there was a comma that was
 
00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:39.539 align:start position:0%
missing so that that was fixed that
 
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
Grandma change page two line 25 a
 
00:18:47.049 --> 00:18:47.059 align:start position:0%
reference to eight USC
 
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
1226 was added and then
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
um on line 36 of page two
 
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
the amended language is changed to
 
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
reference restrictive policy so from a
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
high level those are the changes to the
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
bill that were received in this
 
00:19:11.409 --> 00:19:11.419 align:start position:0%
committee that are reflected in 19
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1983.
 
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll just hold there and I will let
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
other people
 
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
um comment
 
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you represent representative L
 
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:28.500 align:start position:0%

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
on this so would you please go ahead
 
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.270 align:start position:0%
on this so would you please go ahead
please

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good morning
 
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.110 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good morning
everyone

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.770 align:start position:0%
everyone
um

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
I believe that SB 132 was born out of
 
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:42.780 align:start position:0%
necessity as some cities and towns and
 
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
criminal justice agencies create and
 
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
Implement policies and ordinances or
 
00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:49.909 align:start position:0%
Implement policies and ordinances or
standards

00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
for the management of aliens when
 
00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:54.440 align:start position:0%
encountered in in the community
 
00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
or while in custody of law enforcement
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
the result of an arrest
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
for a state crime or perhaps for a
 
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
different matter related to Public
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
Safety or national security
 
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
after close examination of the bill as
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
amended by the other body I did some
 
00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:18.059 align:start position:0%
fact checking and interviewed officials
 
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
having first-hand experience with
 
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
immigration detainers and I felt the
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
bill needed Improvement
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
what this bill does not do
 
00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:31.700 align:start position:0%
is mandate
 
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
apprehensions detentions or arrests the
 
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
conducting of raids and checkpoints
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily conducted investigations or
 
00:20:44.289 --> 00:20:44.299 align:start position:0%
identification checks
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
there were claims in
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
Testament written testimony that
 
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
honoring immigration detainers was
 
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.770 align:start position:0%
honoring immigration detainers was
mandatory

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.270 align:start position:0%
mandatory
but

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
the bill would have to say that it would
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
have to say shall
 
00:21:03.529 --> 00:21:03.539 align:start position:0%
enforce immigration detainers such as
 
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
Founders in Texas law
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
so this this bill
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
is state law that is mirroring federal
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
law which
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
is allowed
 
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.029 align:start position:0%
is allowed
um

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
the term anti-sanctuary act had no
 
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:26.940 align:start position:0%
contextual meaning based on fact and law
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm taking to Heart protesters adamant
 
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
opposition to the acts title it was
 
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
changed to secure New Hampshire
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
communities act because the bill speaks
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
to the prevention of policies that would
 
00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:44.940 align:start position:0%
make communities less safe and secure
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
um the term Sanctuary policy under Roman
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
7 underwent a change
 
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.510 align:start position:0%
7 underwent a change
um

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:57.289 --> 00:21:57.299 align:start position:0%
by eliminating the phrases including but
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
not limited limited to because that
 
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
language was overly Broad
 
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
and the phrase cooperating with Federal
 
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
immigration laws was vague and subject
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
to interpretation
 
00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419 align:start position:0%
for the definition to be fair and
 
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
reasonable to those governed by federal
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
immigration laws and in its application
 
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
um the federal law that expressly
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
addresses restrictions on Communications
 
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
um and another type of communication is
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
addressed in section 1226 which was
 
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
one communicates with an official not a
 
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:50.220 align:start position:0%
law so the language was changed to item
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
a communicating with Federal immigration
 
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
agency officials pursuant to those
 
00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:01.610 align:start position:0%
agency officials pursuant to those
sections

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
section 1357 of ausc
 
00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
ifically d
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
speaks to cooperation with ice relative
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
to aliens violating controlled substance
 
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:14.870 align:start position:0%
to aliens violating controlled substance
laws

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
and that's a case where if a law
 
00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
enforcement agent has a reason to
 
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
believe that an alien has not been
 
00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
lawfully admitted
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
they can inform ice they can request a
 
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
determination of whether or not to issue
 
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
a detainer or to detain the alien
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
um and if issued and the alien is not
 
00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
otherwise detained
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
I spoke with several
 
00:23:48.659 --> 00:23:49.310 align:start position:0%
I spoke with several
um

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh correctional centers to include
 
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
Merrimack and Stratford and I obtained
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
the policy standard operation operating
 
00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
procedure from the city of Manchester
 
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
and from the state police
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
and both of them
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
um Manchester says they will honor
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
detention uh detainer notices under
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances and I believe it
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
mirrors uh federal law
 
00:24:21.289 --> 00:24:21.299 align:start position:0%
So based on all this research I believe
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
this bill affords municipalities and
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
agencies with the ability
 
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
to create so-called welcoming policies
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
and standard operating procedures that
 
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
do not provide a safe haven for
 
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
non-citizen law Breakers within our
 
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.370 align:start position:0%
non-citizen law Breakers within our
communities

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.210 align:start position:0%
communities
um

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
than immigrants and non-immigrants are
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
afforded the benefit of guidelines
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
regarding the management of any alien
 
00:24:51.049 --> 00:24:51.059 align:start position:0%
who is subject to federal laws governing
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
immigration it avoids a hodgepodge of
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
rules that differ from jurisdiction to
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction collide with federal law or
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
hamstring local law enforcement
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
officials from complying with applicable
 
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
federal laws or from exercising their
 
00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:09.710 align:start position:0%
federal laws or from exercising their
discretion

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
00:25:12.049 --> 00:25:12.059 align:start position:0%
there's no inequities in this bill
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't create a liability
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
regarding federal state or state
 
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights nor does it impose
 
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
a mandated financial burden of any kind
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
since compliance would be in the course
 
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
of routine law enforcement duties or
 
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
by contract with the federal government
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups will be able to more
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
clearly explain to lawfully present
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
individuals their rights under state law
 
00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.390 align:start position:0%
individuals their rights under state law
and

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
I believe that the collective we we must
 
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
be proactive to keep our citizens safe
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:03.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:06.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
representative Elward could you turn off
 
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:15.470 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
a couple of things in this amendment
 
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
that I
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
um still have
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
um that I don't think that we're fully
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
addressed that were mentioned inside of
 
00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
the um hearing was the
 
00:26:30.779 --> 00:26:32.289 align:start position:0%
the um hearing was the
um

00:26:32.289 --> 00:26:32.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
the definition of local government
 
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.789 align:start position:0%
the definition of local government
entity

00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
entity
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
included random officials and what they
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
said and
 
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
um I think that a government entity is
 
00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
the entity itself and no individual
 
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
right of no uh
 
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.529 align:start position:0%
right of no uh
um

00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:51.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
no selectmin is representing the
 
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
government they only represent when they
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
vote as a board and so if a Randomness
 
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
selectman has some some preferences or
 
00:27:08.049 --> 00:27:08.059 align:start position:0%
whatever that should not be
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
considered some government policy so I
 
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
have a problem with
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
um the language on line 18 of of this
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
amendment on page two
 
00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
um policy I still think that practice
 
00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
Customs things Unwritten are still too
 
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
vague if you're trying to say that the
 
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
government has a policy then make it a
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
policy that it has to be a written
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
policy that this is what they're doing
 
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:38.820 align:start position:0%
and um then it's clear and you're not
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
going to court to find out whether or
 
00:27:40.799 --> 00:27:41.750 align:start position:0%
going to court to find out whether or
not

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
um you know some statistical analysis of
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
how often they reach out to uh
 
00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559 align:start position:0%
um the federal government means that
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
they have uh Unwritten practice of not
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
doing it I don't think that's
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate so I think that we still
 
00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
need to work on uh Roman six
 
00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.769 align:start position:0%
need to work on uh Roman six
there

00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
um I think that on line 22 of page two
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
the restrictive policy means any policy
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
that prohibits limits or discourages I
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
think discouraging and limits is kind of
 
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about when we're
 
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
talking about prohibit
 
00:28:20.409 --> 00:28:20.419 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about
 
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
prioritization if you say I really would
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
like you to actually go and Patrol the
 
00:28:26.159 --> 00:28:27.830 align:start position:0%
like you to actually go and Patrol the
streets

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
streets
 
00:28:30.649 --> 00:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
instead of writing you know reaching out
 
00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
to you know spending an hour or whatever
 
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
on the phone with the federal government
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
I think that is a prior
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
um that may be considered discouraging
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
that may be to skip
 
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:42.769 align:start position:0%
that may be to skip
um

00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
considered limiting and so just make it
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
explicit that it's prohibiting if you
 
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
say you cannot do this under any
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
circumstances this is what you're trying
 
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
to not to to limit so I think those
 
00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
things still need to be worked on and I
 
00:28:58.669 --> 00:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
think that the
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
um that there is some interest in
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
working on that stuff
 
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:06.230 align:start position:0%
um and so
um

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
in in my like overall I kind of agree
 
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
with what we did with the the gun stuff
 
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
and said like the federal government you
 
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
want to make rules you make rules you do
 
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
it that's not our problem we don't need
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
to be funding that or if you fall down
 
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
that's not where the state needs to come
 
00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
and pick up the the slack on that and so
 
00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
I think in as a matter of State policy
 
00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
that I think that this is wrong
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:29:39.549 --> 00:29:39.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to to work with and and and
 
00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:42.419 align:start position:0%
allow that
 
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
um some of a possible amendment that
 
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
that addresses some of these issues
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
might be be drafted so I I
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
um I also think that it would be good to
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
put something in here that explicitly
 
00:29:58.130 --> 00:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
states that nothing in this act shall be
 
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:00.020 align:start position:0%
constituted to prohibit the
 
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
prioritization of of law enforcement
 
00:30:06.049 --> 00:30:06.059 align:start position:0%
agency resources if this if that's what
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
um the the advocators of this this uh
 
00:30:12.889 --> 00:30:12.899 align:start position:0%
language uh believe and that's their
 
00:30:12.899 --> 00:30:14.149 align:start position:0%
language uh believe and that's their
stated

00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
stated
 
00:30:14.159 --> 00:30:15.470 align:start position:0%
stated
um

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
um preference and I think it should be
 
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
stated inside the bill also
 
00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
so for those Reasons I'm not going to
 
00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of this this amendment
 
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
um but I do hope that that
 
00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:33.419 align:start position:0%
um you know if this was to come come on
 
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
the floor that they would they'd work to
 
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
to address some of those issues that I
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
still think are um outstanding thank you
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:45.799 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
the whole concept of immigration policy
 
00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.769 align:start position:0%
the whole concept of immigration policy
is

00:30:57.769 --> 00:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
is at the front of everyone's mindset at
 
00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:06.299 align:start position:0%
this point because of the crisis that we
 
00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:09.419 align:start position:0%
have that's occurring all across this
 
00:31:09.419 --> 00:31:10.669 align:start position:0%
have that's occurring all across this
country

00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:16.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.870 align:start position:0%
 
media

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
media
 
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:22.820 align:start position:0%
and all of the information that is
 
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
generated sometimes is harmful
 
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.690 align:start position:0%
generated sometimes is harmful
to

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:28.700 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
actually accomplishing the ends that I
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
think everyone has and that's to to live
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
in a harmonious
 
00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:41.710 align:start position:0%
in a harmonious
um

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
civilized society
 
00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
I think the definitions
 
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
00:31:54.889 --> 00:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
here in this amendment really promote a
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
better understanding of
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
uh what our policy here in the state of
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the state of New
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be and I will therefore
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
uh support the event
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:15.539 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:19.909 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:23.220 align:start position:0%
this is a complicate complex bill
 
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
and I spent a lot of time analyzing it
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
in considering the testimony that we
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
heard here in this committee
 
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
as well as I looked at the um the Senate
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
hearing and the
 
00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:39.059 align:start position:0%
testimony there
 
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
and I just
 
00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
um want to emphasize
 
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
as I see this bill that with regards to
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
the issue at hand there there are three
 
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
approaches on a spectrum
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
and those three lanes if you will would
 
00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
be that we mandate cooperation
 
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
and this bill does not do that
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
and on the other end of the spectrum
 
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
would be prohibiting cooperation
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
through policies that are restrictive
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
and prohibit
 
00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:15.539 align:start position:0%
which some municipalities in fact we
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
know do
 
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
and this bill does not
 
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.289 align:start position:0%
and this bill does not
um

00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
it the bill does not
 
00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:31.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.529 --> 00:33:33.539 align:start position:0%
where we want to be is in this this
 
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
Middle Lane
 
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
where we bring it back to
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
it's allowing for a cooperation which
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
makes it therefore discretionary so
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
we're not we don't want to be at any
 
00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.029 align:start position:0%
we're not we don't want to be at any
extreme

00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
extreme
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
we want to be in the middle and I feel
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
that this bill language does that to
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
bring it back to allow that discretion
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
in the prioritization of of resources in
 
00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
in what it does do is it it it it
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
elimits the outright prohibition because
 
00:34:13.129 --> 00:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
if you think about it prohibiting
 
00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
policies that prohibit or restrict
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
cooperation do in fact take away the
 
00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.930 align:start position:0%
cooperation do in fact take away the
discretion

00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
00:34:23.089 --> 00:34:23.099 align:start position:0%
and I think that's an issue and then
 
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
what we end up with is a patchwork of
 
00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.950 align:start position:0%
what we end up with is a patchwork of
policies

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
you know across the state and that's not
 
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
in the interest
 
00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:33.419 align:start position:0%
of anybody
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
it it it
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
puts into question the Safety and
 
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339 align:start position:0%
Security of our citizens and
 
00:34:47.089 --> 00:34:47.099 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that anybody
 
00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
um that's really what we want we don't
 
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
want that so I just wanted a
 
00:34:55.849 --> 00:34:55.859 align:start position:0%
to emphasize that in in and direct our
 
00:34:59.329 --> 00:34:59.339 align:start position:0%
focus on to what the bill is is doing
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
and it's bringing back that Middle Lane
 
00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:04.460 align:start position:0%
putting everybody in the Middle Lane
 
00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:07.460 align:start position:0%
where it
 
00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:17.339 align:start position:0%

representative

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:24.420 align:start position:0%

go representative clerk go

I always call you clerk I've been called
worse

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
worse
 
00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
uh I just want to say a few things uh
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
this bill's come I built some of this to
 
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
come before this committee on the past
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
couple terms that I've been in and uh
 
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
most of you should know that I was in
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
law enforcement New Hampshire for 30
 
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
years and I retired from the uh New
 
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police and I had several
 
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
occasions where I went into this thing
 
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
but most important thing I want to
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
clarify is my entire 30 years I've never
 
00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
seen a police officer stop someone based
 
00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
on their nationality of their looks or
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's always been
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
based on a violation of New Hampshire
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
law Noah have I ever seen a police
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
officer ask anyone for the Visa or the
 
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.490 align:start position:0%
officer ask anyone for the Visa or the
passport

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:09.500 align:start position:0%
passport
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
the occasions I have seen if in
 
00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
particular actions I've taken I've
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
stopped someone for a motor vehicle
 
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
violation I run his license and it comes
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
back from ncic that there's a detaining
 
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
order from immigration I would help the
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
dispatcher call Immigration to see if
 
00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
they want the person to detained if they
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
did I would take them into custody
 
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
bringing before the district court and
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
he would have his opportunity in court
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
to say why he shouldn't be detained
 
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
um that's the way it's always works as
 
00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
far as I understand
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
um I don't know again I know anybody
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
that's going outside let me see your
 
00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:47.339 align:start position:0%
Visa I really I really don't see that
 
00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:50.339 align:start position:0%
but it's my understanding detainers when
 
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
the federal government issues those
 
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
those are for very serious crimes
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
federal crimes that those individuals
 
00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
have committed
 
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
um again I just don't want people to
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
have the conception that a police
 
00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
officer is about to uh getting paid
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
overtime or anything else to do any type
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
of federal law enforcement as far as
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
immigration is concerned because that's
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
not the purpose
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
but if we don't cooperate with the
 
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
federal government we're not going to
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
solve the immigration immigration
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
problem and again the people that have
 
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:18.300 align:start position:0%
the detaining waters the people that
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
have committed in my experience serious
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
federal crimes against the citizens of
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
the United States and I don't think we
 
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
should promote those folks running
 
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
around to commit federal crimes to State
 
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
crimes against our individuals thank you
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I I would like
 
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
to further emphasize and and direct your
 
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
attention to um on page two Roman
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
numeral seven the definition of
 
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
restrictive policy
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
and just emphasize that
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
this whole section is with respect to
 
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
individuals that are detained by or in
 
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
the custody
 
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement for a specific
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
purpose and that's for suspected
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
violation of a state law
 
00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
so that that's very explicit and and
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
very narrow in in my reading and
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of of the words
 
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
um defining restrictive policy so in my
 
00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:29.579 align:start position:0%
mind that you know cuts out
 
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
a whole you know host of scenarios that
 
00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
people were concerned about and and
 
00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.089 align:start position:0%
people were concerned about and and
spoke

00:38:38.089 --> 00:38:38.099 align:start position:0%
spoke
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
um to during the hearing
 
00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:46.370 align:start position:0%
um to during the hearing
um

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
so again there's no requirement in the
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
bill to cooperate with an immigration
 
00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.510 align:start position:0%
bill to cooperate with an immigration
detainer

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
detainer
 
00:38:56.569 --> 00:38:56.579 align:start position:0%
it brings it back into that that lane
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
where it's again
 
00:39:02.089 --> 00:39:02.099 align:start position:0%
it's at the discretion
 
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
but what the bill does do is it makes it
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
clear that cooperation cannot be
 
00:39:09.839 --> 00:39:12.530 align:start position:0%
clear that cooperation cannot be
prohibited

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
so I I I hope that um
 
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
people understand
 
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
the scope
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
of this bill and the intent of the Bill
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.690 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
11.

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
to address a question to um
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald AKA our esteemed
 
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:37.910 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald AKA our esteemed
clerk

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the specific
 
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
from a from a law enforcement person's
 
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
point of view the specific mode of
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
receiving that information that there is
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
a quote unquote detainer
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
out which which I would assume to mean
 
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:57.900 align:start position:0%
I've read this paragraph a zillion times
 
00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
but I still need clarification on what
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
that means and from whom it comes
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
if you could enlighten me would you like
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
to answer that Mr Clark I would be glad
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
you were now thank you representative
 
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:14.180 align:start position:0%
the way it worked when I was on the job
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
issued one maybe one to 10 21 or 10 22
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's a a 21 is a Motor Vehicle Record
 
00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:23.099 align:start position:0%
and a 22 is a license check which you
 
00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
can check driver's licenses all over the
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
country and you can also request
 
00:40:29.089 --> 00:40:29.099 align:start position:0%
specific things for Pacific States on
 
00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicle records
 
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
and when you want a 21 or 22 you have a
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
what's called a 1023 hit that'll come up
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
and that's an ncic uh hit that's the
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
national Crim crime information center I
 
00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:45.180 align:start position:0%
think that's what it's called and that's
 
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
uh information that's gathered by law
 
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies entering
 
00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:53.180 align:start position:0%
information like stolen guns stolen cars
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
wanted people things like that they
 
00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
usually all reach to the missing persons
 
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
they reach up to the felony level so
 
00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
when you run that particular name and
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
date of birth it may be an ncic hit
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
which would show a detainer you might do
 
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
some other again there's a lot of John
 
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
Smith's in the world and you now we're
 
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
done with the data brush you may do some
 
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
further uh asking of the of the person
 
00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
you have stopped or the I would ask if
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
it came up as hidden it's the ice cream
 
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
detainer I would have the dispatcher
 
00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
call Immigration advising the
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
information they have they had the
 
00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
person stopping the side of the road for
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
a particular violation and ask them if
 
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
they wanted that individual detained for
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
someone when their Agents come up and
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
pick them up uh if they said uh no then
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
I would just go back to them and tell
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
the person that he stopped that just
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
will let you know that immigration would
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
like to speak with you and maybe you
 
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
could get together with them you're
 
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:47.700 align:start position:0%
missing some documentation or whatever
 
00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:50.579 align:start position:0%
uh but there is a detainer but at this
 
00:41:52.609 --> 00:41:52.619 align:start position:0%
particular time uh they don't want to
 
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
come up and pick you up uh if they were
 
00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
detained I would take them to uh I would
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
have the dispatcher call the court and
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
say I was detaining someone for an
 
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
immigration detainer you'd eventually go
 
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
before the judge uh he would plead his
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
case to the judge you're probably having
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
a quarter appointed attorney and the
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
judge would say okay well immigration
 
00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:14.099 align:start position:0%
has three days to come up and pick him
 
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
up or four days or they must come up
 
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
tomorrow that's all up to the judge he
 
00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:20.099 align:start position:0%
decides how long immigration has to come
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
and pick the pick the individual up I
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
I do have a bit of a follow-up okay
 
00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you very much Mr chair my
 
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
follow-up would be how does that
 
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
detainer get into the system
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
it would be again
 
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
based on my experience I've been retired
 
00:42:42.849 --> 00:42:42.859 align:start position:0%
now for several years that retainer that
 
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
detainer is put in by and put into ncic

representative
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
for the discussion on the main Bill
 
00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
um I understand the concern uh that this
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
bill was brought forth to address
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
um however I I don't see the effect of
 
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
that concern I think it's you know I I
 
00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
think the internet is a powerful tool
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
media is a powerful tool and and I think
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
we're being lied to a little bit this
 
00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
isn't the southern border this isn't
 
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
Arizona or New Mexico or any of the
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
other states and I understand that
 
00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:11.579 align:start position:0%
people think it it could be if we don't
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
pass legislation like this I don't think
 
00:45:17.089 --> 00:45:17.099 align:start position:0%
that's the case uh we have immigration
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
laws those laws are being enforced a
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
place like Peterborough which has one of
 
00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
these quote-unquote Sanctuary laws I
 
00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
talked to the chief of police there they
 
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
work with immigration they meet with the
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
immigration officials and they act on
 
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
detainments uh so I I just fail to see
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
where the solution the solution that
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
this this bill is bringing for so I I we
 
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
the representative power brought up uh
 
00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
this brings us to a middle ground of
 
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
discretion it seems to me as though the
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
discretion is already there and and this
 
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
is trying to get a win where there is
 
00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.130 align:start position:0%
is trying to get a win where there is
none

00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
none
 
00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:58.990 align:start position:0%
none
um

00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:02.460 align:start position:0%
undocumented people uh or illegal
 
00:46:05.569 --> 00:46:05.579 align:start position:0%
immigrants are are not coming from
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
spaceships they're not aliens they're
 
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:10.140 align:start position:0%
they're undocumented illegal immigrants
 
00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
and I think that our immigration system
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
goes much deeper than uh there are
 
00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
people running around our communities
 
00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
who need to be picked up and jailed and
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
thrown back to Nicaragua I think the
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
problem is that we haven't addressed on
 
00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
a federal level immigration policy for
 
00:46:29.089 --> 00:46:29.099 align:start position:0%
the last 40 years and we're seeing the
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
effect of that right now on the southern
 
00:46:32.569 --> 00:46:32.579 align:start position:0%
border where and this is where this is
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
where I might get in trouble with my
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
Democrat colleagues that there is a
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
serious Chaos on the southern border I
 
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
see that and uh that is as a result of
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
40 Years of no immigration policy 40
 
00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:48.180 align:start position:0%
Years of Destruction in in Southern
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
America and uh you know frankly
 
00:46:52.319 --> 00:46:52.910 align:start position:0%
America and uh you know frankly
um

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:56.750 --> 00:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
doing this detaining uh more people
 
00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
where uh there there are not is that
 
00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
it's not the way to to solve the
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
solution and I think that uh
 
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
undocumented people uh deserve a better
 
00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:07.980 align:start position:0%
solution than that
 
00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
um it's not uh
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
open Borders or welcoming everyone here
 
00:47:12.599 --> 00:47:13.910 align:start position:0%
open Borders or welcoming everyone here
that's

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:47:17.089 --> 00:47:17.099 align:start position:0%
not what anyone is is proposing and I
 
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:18.420 align:start position:0%
think we're getting lost in the
 
00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
conversation there when we when we bring
 
00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
the national federal immigration
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
conversation here on to a state level
 
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:27.900 align:start position:0%
where it isn't happening it's not
 
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
happening and a legislation like this
 
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
won't stop it from happening if it was
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
going to happen so I will be proudly
 
00:47:38.329 --> 00:47:38.339 align:start position:0%
voting against SB 132.
 
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Cahill
 
00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
well I greatly respect and admire my
 
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
colleague from the other side
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
um the reason why we're state
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
representatives in New Hampshire is to
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
look out for our people and I think that
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment and this bill
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
goes a little further to look out for
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
the rights and protect our people so I
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative priests uh point of
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
clarification we're just discussing the
 
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
an ought to pass motion on sb-132 that
 
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
would be correct okay without the
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that's correct
 
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative Edward
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:48:28.849 --> 00:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
um representative wheeler I'd like to
 
00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
address uh your use of undocumented
 
00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
illegal aliens it's that that's not a
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
statutorily defined uh phrase
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
uh an alien is anyone who's in the
 
00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
country who's not a naturalized citizen
 
00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:47.569 align:start position:0%
country who's not a naturalized citizen
so

00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:47.579 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
case in point for this bill
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
is the example of an ordinance that
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
appears to limit restrict and prevent
 
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:58.140 align:start position:0%
local police from fully communicating or
 
00:49:00.589 --> 00:49:00.599 align:start position:0%
sharing certain information with
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
immigration officials is the town of
 
00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.069 align:start position:0%
immigration officials is the town of
Harrisville

00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
Harrisville
 
00:49:08.329 --> 00:49:08.339 align:start position:0%
that enacted an ordinance in 2017 the
 
00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
Warren article in part reads the police
 
00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
officers and the performance of their
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
routine duties
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
will not ask a person any person about
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
his or her immigration status and will
 
00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
refuse to share information regarding
 
00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
any person with
 
00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.390 align:start position:0%
any person with
ice

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
ice
 
00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
except in cases involving allegations
 
00:49:35.329 --> 00:49:35.339 align:start position:0%
against such a person of violent
 
00:49:38.569 --> 00:49:38.579 align:start position:0%
criminal activity or a violation of New
 
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
violent criminal activity is not defined
 
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
and it excludes non-violent misdemeanor
 
00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:53.420 align:start position:0%
crimes that trigger Isis Deport
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
deportation ability
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
such as
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
contributing to the delinquency of a
 
00:50:01.609 --> 00:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
minor child endangerment
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
violation of a protective order
 
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
failure to register as a sex offender a
 
00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:11.099 align:start position:0%
possession of child pornography owning a
 
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:14.060 align:start position:0%
prostitution business indecent exposure
 
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
shoplifting having a fake ID trespass
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
stalking Etc
 
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
so the question is why would any
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
Community or agency want to refuse
 
00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:29.819 align:start position:0%
sharing misdemeanor information with ice
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
and give a free pass to these
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
um without releasing you know removable
 
00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
aliens back into the community
 
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
potentially exposes law-abiding citizens
 
00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:50.660 align:start position:0%
and non-citizens to re-offending harm
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
and the selectman for the town expressed
 
00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
his opinion that if passed the bill
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
would render the town ordinance null and
 
00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.630 align:start position:0%
would render the town ordinance null and
void

00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
void
 
00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.549 align:start position:0%
void
well

00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
maybe it should
 
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
um it's not the end of the world if this
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
bill passes the towns can simply amend
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
their ordinances to comply with SB 132
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:19.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
foreign

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
and um contrary to what my esteemed
 
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
colleague representative Edward just
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
said this is not enabling legislation
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
this is a mandate this is a Statewide
 
00:51:32.809 --> 00:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
mandate what we're what we're talking
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
about now is the underlying bill which
 
00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
prohibits Sanctuary policies and I have
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of questions that I would just
 
00:51:43.609 --> 00:51:43.619 align:start position:0%
like to put out for the good of the
 
00:51:43.619 --> 00:51:44.829 align:start position:0%
like to put out for the good of the
order

00:51:44.829 --> 00:51:44.839 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
and one is
 
00:51:49.970 --> 00:51:49.980 align:start position:0%
if I sit on a planning board in any New
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire municipality
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
and we're at a break in the action and
 
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
we're talking amongst our colleagues and
 
00:51:59.089 --> 00:51:59.099 align:start position:0%
the subject of quote unquote Sanctuary
 
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
policies comes up which is now what
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
we're debating here Sanctuary policies
 
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
because we're done with the amendment
 
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
if we're just casually talking and I say
 
00:52:12.049 --> 00:52:12.059 align:start position:0%
to a colleague so I saw a story on the
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
news yesterday about Sanctuary policies
 
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
what do you think and my colleague says
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
well I'm
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
mixed about it I just don't know what I
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
think and I say yeah I know some good
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
things about it some bad things about it
 
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
but overall you know I can't see it
 
00:52:29.089 --> 00:52:29.099 align:start position:0%
where it hurt I could get hauled into
 
00:52:29.099 --> 00:52:30.230 align:start position:0%
where it hurt I could get hauled into
court

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
under the precepts of this bill
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
because I am
 
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
part of a city
 
00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
governmental entity as a member of the
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
planning board now as a member of the
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
planning board I also enjoy a form of
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
qualified immunity so how does how do
 
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
those two things Square I don't see
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
where this bill is legal in any sense of
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
the word because it violates My First
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights to speak my mind
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
it potentially violates the Fourth
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment right against unlawful search
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
and seizure and it would immediately
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
result in lawsuits from any number of
 
00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:10.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities across New Hampshire
 
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
challenging challenging its legality and
 
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
therefore resulting in huge expenditures
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
of funds that would ultimately be borne
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:28.370 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:32.099 align:start position:0%
I have to agree with representative
 
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
wheeler about the the southern border
 
00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
and the the kind of
 
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:39.430 align:start position:0%
and the the kind of
um

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:44.579 align:start position:0%
there is a broken immigration policy in
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
this country
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:53:48.359 --> 00:53:49.010 align:start position:0%
um and
um

00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
the fact that you have to wait years and
 
00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
possibly already have a family member
 
00:53:56.089 --> 00:53:56.099 align:start position:0%
that's in the United States and all of
 
00:53:58.010 --> 00:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
this stuff for you to be able to come
 
00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.390 align:start position:0%
this stuff for you to be able to come
here

00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.650 align:start position:0%
here
um

00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.870 align:start position:0%
um
is

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
you know a failure of the federal
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
government and we are not going to fix
 
00:54:09.049 --> 00:54:09.059 align:start position:0%
that here and there is also a lot of
 
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
concern about that failure
 
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
and their failure on the drug policies
 
00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:16.910 align:start position:0%
and their failure on the drug policies
um

00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:20.329 --> 00:54:20.339 align:start position:0%
kind of combining at this Southern
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
border to you know enhance cartel
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
activity and all of that stuff that is
 
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
having negative effects on the United
 
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
States at the southern border and as a
 
00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
whole like
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
um some people would like to see
 
00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
um Fentanyl and stuff like that they
 
00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:42.260 align:start position:0%
believe that that's a you know
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
a negative Downstream side effect of
 
00:54:48.589 --> 00:54:48.599 align:start position:0%
both the drug policy and the immigration
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
policies that we have in this country
 
00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:52.980 align:start position:0%
we're not going to fix that in in New
 
00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I do
 
00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
um think that this is kind of a a reach
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
around kind of way to get at more drug
 
00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.250 align:start position:0%
around kind of way to get at more drug
enforcement

00:55:07.250 --> 00:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:08.109 align:start position:0%
enforcement
um

00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
and I come I'm completely opposed to the
 
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
drug war I think you've we've already
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
failed and we think it should be I think
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
it should be stopped and
 
00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:19.430 align:start position:0%
it should be stopped and
um

00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:22.609 --> 00:55:22.619 align:start position:0%
and so I don't like this from that
 
00:55:22.619 --> 00:55:23.750 align:start position:0%
and so I don't like this from that
perspective

00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think that the that we should be
 
00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
enforcing Federal
 
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:28.670 align:start position:0%
enforcing Federal
um

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh drug policy in New Hampshire I don't
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
think that we should be enforcing
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
Federal Gun policy I don't think we
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
should be forcing Federal immigration
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
policy and so I think that under all of
 
00:55:44.809 --> 00:55:44.819 align:start position:0%
these it's a it's you know the federal
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
government may be failing they may be
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
failing on a policy level they may be
 
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
failing on a in implementation of their
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
policy level but that is not really
 
00:55:56.329 --> 00:55:56.339 align:start position:0%
something that New Hampshire should try
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
to seek to solve
 
00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.210 align:start position:0%
to seek to solve
um

00:55:59.210 --> 00:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
I do
 
00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:01.849 align:start position:0%
I do
um

00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
like that we did not change our our
 
00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
policy in the house that if if a if a
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
bill comes out with no recommendation
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
then the person then the the preferred
 
00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass so that if any
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that we bring here today
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
can be rectified before that time that
 
00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
they can offer an amendment
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
um at that time and hopefully those
 
00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
concerns can be addressed and so my hope
 
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
today is that I would like to see
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
um some more work being done not that I
 
00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
will probably ever support such a policy
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
um but I think I like the conversation
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
and where it's headed
 
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.910 align:start position:0%
as far as
um

00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
like on on the Republicans trying to
 
00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
explain where they where they're coming
 
00:57:01.609 --> 00:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
from and so while I don't support the
 
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
the bill I do hope for that that no
 
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman
 
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
um I need to uh
 
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
talk about an incident in Exeter
 
00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:25.140 align:start position:0%
and we have talked before about uh
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
enabling laws that are not enabling but
 
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:31.160 align:start position:0%
passing laws or bills that reiterate
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
federal law because it will be easier to
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
find in New Hampshire law
 
00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.030 align:start position:0%
find in New Hampshire law
um

00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
and I think you might agree that the
 
00:57:44.990 --> 00:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
research through the U.S code is uh can
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
be very dense
 
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
um in Exeter we had an incident where
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
someone came to the aid of our police
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
department and then was detained he had
 
00:57:56.569 --> 00:57:56.579 align:start position:0%
committed no crime
 
00:57:58.210 --> 00:57:58.220 align:start position:0%
um he was
 
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
coordinated with ice and he was detained
 
00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
and kept for five months at the loss of
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
his income and uh and
 
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
a relationship with his family and the
 
00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:14.579 align:start position:0%
town was sued and we lost uh forty
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars so I see that adopting
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
a sanctuary policy may be necessary in
 
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
order to inform our police what they can
 
00:58:29.049 --> 00:58:29.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh let's see here who hasn't spoken yet
 
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
we'll go to representative Brown I see
 
00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have many family
 
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
members and many friends in law
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement who basically just want to
 
00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
enforce the law and not be restricted
 
00:58:47.809 --> 00:58:47.819 align:start position:0%
from enforcing the law so once a
 
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
violation has been identified much like
 
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh representative McDonald indicated
 
00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
they don't want to be prevented from
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
doing so and although some people here
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
might not think that we have issues in
 
00:59:00.890 --> 00:59:00.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire our alarm enforcement
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
people tell me that that is the case so
 
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
I just think that this law would allow
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
us to address immigration issues when
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
they're identified not searching them
 
00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.299 align:start position:0%
out but when they're identified like
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald indicated then
 
00:59:17.809 --> 00:59:17.819 align:start position:0%
it gives the ability to enforce the law
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
representative representative wheeler
 
00:59:23.569 --> 00:59:23.579 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just to address
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
what representative Cahill and
 
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
representative Alward said both two
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
people with whom I have great respect
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
for and I'm sure you and I will be out
 
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
after this and I'm sure representative
 
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
Cahill will be talking after this so
 
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
this won't change that but I think this
 
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
is protecting our people and protecting
 
00:59:42.289 --> 00:59:42.299 align:start position:0%
the rights of them I have spoken to the
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
Manchester police I've spoken to my
 
00:59:47.089 --> 00:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
police chief I've spoken to many people
 
00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
in my community many people in my
 
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
community reached out for this they
 
00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:53.339 align:start position:0%
don't support this policy and its effect
 
00:59:55.849 --> 00:59:55.859 align:start position:0%
because they as people who have lived
 
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
there that live here their entire lives
 
01:00:00.289 --> 01:00:00.299 align:start position:0%
want a welcoming and Safe Community for
 
01:00:02.809 --> 01:00:02.819 align:start position:0%
all people and as representative Gilman
 
01:00:06.049 --> 01:00:06.059 align:start position:0%
just Illustrated sometimes it's not all
 
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
criminals who are being detained by ice
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
and uh held without their will and
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
having their lives taken away from them
 
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
it's not all criminals it's sometimes
 
01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:17.460 align:start position:0%
people who are just simply immigrants
 
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
who may have their documents Etc and I
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
think that speaks to representative
 
01:00:24.289 --> 01:00:24.299 align:start position:0%
point that we need to fix our federal
 
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
immigration system so that we're
 
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
enforcing the laws that are on the books
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
and making sure that the ones that are
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
lacking are strengthened so that
 
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
situations like that aren't happening
 
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
and that we don't have a border which
 
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
people can run over uh with no
 
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh recourse whatsoever I think that's
 
01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
something that most people would agree
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
with um to representative alward's Point
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
um if you commit some of the crimes you
 
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:51.180 align:start position:0%
outlined if you are in possession of
 
01:00:54.049 --> 01:00:54.059 align:start position:0%
child pornography and cod if you are a a
 
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:56.700 align:start position:0%
pedophile and and you are arrested for
 
01:00:59.089 --> 01:00:59.099 align:start position:0%
that crime uh or if you commit a
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
felonious murder if you Etc uh you will
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
go to court and that will be a a
 
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
decently large court case and in the
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
process of you going to court getting
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
your papers Etc uh immigration will find
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
you and that is on the books as it
 
01:01:16.849 --> 01:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
stands and this does not change that at
 
01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
all if you commit one of those crimes
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to jail and in the process
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
of you going to jail you're going to be
 
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
found and immigration will come and take
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
you and process you uh thus far that's
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
happens here in New Hampshire that's I
 
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
think the the appropriate process and
 
01:01:33.829 --> 01:01:33.839 align:start position:0%
how it should continue to move forward
 
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
and and to representative yokelo's point
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
I mean we've got the sit alone cartels
 
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
basically running the country to our
 
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
Southern board I think the problem is
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
far deeper than some people have crossed
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
out over in our in our uh in our
 
01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
communities it's that's not the problem
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
and I I I just I fail to see that so
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I won't speak any
 
01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
further as a substitute I appreciate
 
01:01:58.970 --> 01:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
your deference and uh thank you
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
I think this uh whole issue
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
that's brought up by
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
SB 132 is fundamental
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
to our responsibility as legislators
 
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
and the responsibility of government
 
01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.589 align:start position:0%
and the responsibility of government
itself

01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
itself
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
we are a nation
 
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
of laws
 
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
we are not a nation of men
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
now if we took a poll of all the peoples
 
01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
that inhabit
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
the planet Earth
 
01:02:44.809 --> 01:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you would find that a great
 
01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
percentage of them would like to leave
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
where they are
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
and go to a different country
 
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
and a great percentage of those would
 
01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
there are many reasons why people come
 
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.370 align:start position:0%
there are many reasons why people come
here

01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
but one of the overriding reasons above
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
and beyond the fact that their country
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
of origin is not a safe country it's
 
01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
it's not a good place for them to raise
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
their children
 
01:03:21.289 --> 01:03:21.299 align:start position:0%
uh another reason is for The Economic
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
Opportunity so if if we have
 
01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
uh 300 and some thousand people in this
 
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:31.430 align:start position:0%
uh 300 and some thousand people in this
country

01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
country
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
well if we just opened our our I meant
 
01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
million if we opened our border and let
 
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to come here for
 
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
whatever reason
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
we would be totally inundated with
 
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.410 align:start position:0%
we would be totally inundated with
people

01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:03:52.089 --> 01:03:52.099 align:start position:0%
from all over the world we are
 
01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
our immigration system simply could not
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
handle it
 
01:03:59.809 --> 01:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
so where are we today
 
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
well for a long time we had
 
01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:06.619 align:start position:0%
thousands of people coming
 
01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
across the southern border and yes there
 
01:04:15.549 --> 01:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
were too many for the people to handle
 
01:04:21.289 --> 01:04:21.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
but they were down there
 
01:04:24.119 --> 01:04:26.569 align:start position:0%
but they were down there
and

01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:26.579 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:26.579 --> 01:04:27.170 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
and they didn't
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
seem to come any further
 
01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
now where are we today we have eight or
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
ten thousand per day
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
coming across our border there are tens
 
01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
of thousands of people that are
 
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:45.950 align:start position:0%
of thousands of people that are
trying

01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
trying
 
01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
to make it to this country in any way
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we can our border patrol and people
 
01:04:56.770 --> 01:04:56.780 align:start position:0%
at the federal level who are responsible
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
for enforcing the laws at the border
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
simply cannot do it they're inundated by
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
people people are coming in they're
 
01:05:10.609 --> 01:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
totally unvetted we have no idea of
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
their health status their legal status
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
or any other status
 
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.750 align:start position:0%
or any other status
so

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden now
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
we're we're having people show up in New
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
York City and Chicago
 
01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
and Martha's Vineyard and all over the
 
01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
country by the busload and oh my gosh
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
full disclosure
 
01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
several Generations ago my
 
01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:44.990 align:start position:0%
several Generations ago my
great-grandfather

01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
great-grandfather
 
01:05:47.809 --> 01:05:47.819 align:start position:0%
was an illegal alien
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
he was arrested and it was a half a mile
 
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
in front of the local sheriff
 
01:05:58.970 --> 01:05:58.980 align:start position:0%
for shooting one of the king's rabbits
 
01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:00.289 align:start position:0%
for shooting one of the king's rabbits
he

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:00.299 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
stowed away on a ship and came to this
 
01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
country and that was back before the
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
Civil War
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
so I am in a way I have his blood
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
flowing through my veins
 
01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.569 align:start position:0%
flowing through my veins
but

01:06:17.569 --> 01:06:17.579 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
I get back to the point if we are going
 
01:06:26.329 --> 01:06:26.339 align:start position:0%
to be choosing what laws we're going to
 
01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
enforce and what laws were not going to
 
01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:32.900 align:start position:0%
enforce and have people in one
 
01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:34.690 align:start position:0%
enforce and have people in one
municipality

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:34.700 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:06:38.289 --> 01:06:38.299 align:start position:0%
enforcing this and in another
 
01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
municipality saying you cannot cooperate
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
with the federal law
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
and the federal government are the ones
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
that are supposed to be
 
01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
in charge here you cannot
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
cooperate with Federal authorities then
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
I think you are opening the door
 
01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:05.029 align:start position:0%
I think you are opening the door
to

01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:10.450 align:start position:0%
 
now

01:07:10.450 --> 01:07:10.460 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
the impact
 
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
of slack immigration policies
 
01:07:20.029 --> 01:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
affects us not just from an immigrant
 
01:07:20.039 --> 01:07:21.589 align:start position:0%
affects us not just from an immigrant
standpoint

01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
it affects us
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
we have a a fentanyl crisis here
 
01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.339 align:start position:0%
I think most people admit that the
 
01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
fentanyl that is killing tens of
 
01:07:38.750 --> 01:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
thousands of people here in New
 
01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:41.329 align:start position:0%
thousands of people here in New
Hampshire

01:07:41.329 --> 01:07:41.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
not tens of thousands but we have many
 
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
people who are being killed by fentanyl
 
01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
poisoned it's not drug abuse it's poison
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
a lot of that fentanyl is coming across
 
01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
the southern border and a lot of it
 
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
comes through ports of Entry why is it
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
coming through ports of Entry because
 
01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
I think this bill
 
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
is a step in the right direction
 
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
to get things back in line
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
to Force the federal government
 
01:08:32.329 --> 01:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
to take responsible policies to enforce
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
and that goes right down to the local
 
01:08:37.799 --> 01:08:39.289 align:start position:0%
and that goes right down to the local
level

01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:39.299 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I I agree with
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
representative lascalis and I'd like to
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledge representative Gilman's
 
01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:53.809 align:start position:0%
acknowledge representative Gilman's
comment

01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are substituting
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
you may not know that on January 26th of
 
01:09:01.150 --> 01:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:09:04.150 --> 01:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
lobbyists Nate Grays are our good friend
 
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
testified before this committee relative
 
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
to a child tax credit bill and he stated
 
01:09:15.610 --> 01:09:15.620 align:start position:0%
as much as it chagrins me to say this
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
you municipalities need solid guidelines
 
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
on what to do
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't have a survey of
 
01:09:27.769 --> 01:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
all the towns and cities and agencies to
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
determine the existence of policies that
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
may be in effect that conflict with
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:36.229 align:start position:0%
federal law
um

01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:38.329 --> 01:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
so I I believe this bill provides
 
01:09:41.209 --> 01:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
guidelines to prevent a hodgepodge of
 
01:09:41.219 --> 01:09:43.189 align:start position:0%
guidelines to prevent a hodgepodge of
rules

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:09:43.199 --> 01:09:44.870 align:start position:0%
rules
um

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
and the towns can create policies as
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
long as they don't conflict
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
for the comments
 
01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
representative sellerson
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
I think representative wheeler he's half
 
01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:03.950 align:start position:0%
I think representative wheeler he's half
right

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to undocumented
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
because if I go to Canada
 
01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
and I don't know because Customs I am
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
there in Canada illegally
 
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
but I am undocumented all right so it is
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
both but it's basically no difference in
 
01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
this country if I don't have the
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
paperwork saying I'm here legally I am
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
illegally here that's number one the
 
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
second thing I want to spring up is it
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
sounds like if we don't have a law
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
that's a standard through the entire
 
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
State you're sowing confusion
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
and if I was an illegal in this state
 
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
I'd be scared to death if I left one
 
01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
town and went to another and one police
 
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
force was talking to another the odd be
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
picked up in a heartbeat if I wasn't
 
01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
illegal I wouldn't want to come to this
 
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
state without a law at least put in
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
place so I either know or I don't know
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
where I stand because when you go to one
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
town or another you can it could just
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative further
 
01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:08.050 align:start position:0%
thank you representative further
comments

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:08.060 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have too
 
01:11:14.090 --> 01:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
uh the first one is actually more of a
 
01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
procedural or process type of a issue
 
01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
and it we see this not just in this
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
building but in many bills
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
um somebody previously mentioned uh the
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
the internet and what goes on there
 
01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
and what I want to talk about is the
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
amount of inaccurate information that is
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
put out
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
um on the internet and two examples of
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
that is one I know many of you have
 
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
received Luts and lots of emails on this
 
01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
and I can't tell you how many of them
 
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
are just rooted in errors and
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
misinformation I occasionally engage on
 
01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
some of those and what I have found is
 
01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:59.630 align:start position:0%
some of those and what I have found is
that

01:11:59.630 --> 01:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
um they're usually talking points that
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
are given to an individual the
 
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
individual regurgitates them in an email
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
and most of the time they're wrong and
 
01:12:09.649 --> 01:12:09.659 align:start position:0%
when I engage the individual nine times
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
out of ten that individual has first of
 
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
all doesn't respond to a question but
 
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
has no idea what they're talking about
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
and the occasional person who does
 
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.490 align:start position:0%
and the occasional person who does
respond

01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
respond
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
they don't know what they're talking
 
01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.070 align:start position:0%
they don't know what they're talking
about

01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
that's troubling enough but I'll tell
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
you what's really troubling is when
 
01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
somebody testifies in front of this
 
01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:31.370 align:start position:0%
somebody testifies in front of this
committee

01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:12:35.450 --> 01:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
as a a supposed expert and I'm going to
 
01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
pick on a police chief who testified
 
01:12:40.729 --> 01:12:40.739 align:start position:0%
here from one of our major cities
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
and in his testimonies I'm going to
 
01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
paraphrase it so if I don't get it
 
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
exactly right
 
01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
that he made the point that he didn't
 
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
want his police officers spending time
 
01:12:54.130 --> 01:12:54.140 align:start position:0%
rounding up
 
01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants and when he was
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
challenged on that
 
01:13:01.490 --> 01:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
he went through his paperwork or through
 
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
the bill and couldn't find it and then
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
said well you know I maybe it'll come to
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
that or something to that effect
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
it's very disheartening when somebody in
 
01:13:13.209 --> 01:13:13.219 align:start position:0%
that level of
 
01:13:13.219 --> 01:13:14.870 align:start position:0%
that level of
Authority

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
makes a statement as inaccurate as as
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
that so that's my first point on process
 
01:13:24.649 --> 01:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
the second thing I'm going to talk about
 
01:13:27.649 --> 01:13:27.659 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily a legal illegal
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
immigration but unchecked immigration
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
many of you know I I I fly around the
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
world on a weekly basis I've been doing
 
01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
that for almost 38 years now
 
01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
I have seen
 
01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
the results in the once pristine cities
 
01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
of Paris or Zurich or
 
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
name just about any European city of the
 
01:13:54.169 --> 01:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
results of unchecked immigration when I
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
first started
 
01:13:57.530 --> 01:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
going to these cities in the mid and
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
late 80s
 
01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
Paris for example pristine inside the
 
01:14:06.229 --> 01:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
parific gorgeous never never any kind of
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
trash no nothing
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
but over the years over the 38 years
 
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
that I've been going to Paris
 
01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
it has the social and the fiscal
 
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
and I'll talk about Athens if you really
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
want to talk about fiscal Decay but the
 
01:14:24.649 --> 01:14:24.659 align:start position:0%
societal and fiscal decays of these
 
01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
major cities are just really
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
discouraging you can't go to one of
 
01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
these cities anymore without seeing in
 
01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
one of the major squares in Paris inside
 
01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
the main the main part of the city
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
statues or fountains are now covered
 
01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
with graffiti
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
inside the once beautiful city of Paris
 
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
same thing with same thing with
 
01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
zerk recently I just can't get over how
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
these cities have deteriorated and the
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
comment was made earlier well that's not
 
01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
happening here in New Hampshire I'll
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
tell you something
 
01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
in the last three or four years I've
 
01:15:14.050 --> 01:15:14.060 align:start position:0%
started to see that same
 
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
societal fiscal Decay here in New
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire up until a few years ago did
 
01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
you ever see around the cities of
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester many who are from there
 
01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.930 align:start position:0%
Manchester many who are from there
graffiti

01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
graffiti
 
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
on the bridge abutments no they were
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
always pristine did you ever see
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
graffiti on all the all the wooden
 
01:15:33.169 --> 01:15:33.179 align:start position:0%
fencing they have to cut down on the
 
01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
noise no we're seeing that same societal
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
Decay now I'm not saying that's all on
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
unchecked immigration but there has been
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
something that has changed in New
 
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire over the last few years and I
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
can tell you unequivocally
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing the same thing happen in my
 
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
great state that I have seen happen into
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
these great cities throughout the world
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
so I'd be very cautious
 
01:15:58.729 --> 01:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
um for saying that it's not happening
 
01:16:01.130 --> 01:16:01.140 align:start position:0%
here my final point I'm going to state
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
is the fed's failures at the southern
 
01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.209 align:start position:0%
is the fed's failures at the southern
borders

01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
borders
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
true you're right that is the fed's
 
01:16:07.199 --> 01:16:08.689 align:start position:0%
true you're right that is the fed's
failures

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:08.699 align:start position:0%
failures
 
01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
if they fail we need to protect we need
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
to protect our state
 
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
these bills that we're talking about
 
01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:18.709 align:start position:0%
these bills that we're talking about
are

01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
first of all not mandates
 
01:16:24.649 --> 01:16:24.659 align:start position:0%
but they are for as representative
 
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
McDonald's talked about these are for
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
those committing felonies or serious
 
01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
crimes this isn't rounding up like the
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
police chief from Manchester stated so
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
with that I I will support this Bill
 
01:16:39.050 --> 01:16:39.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for the comments
 
01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:41.219 align:start position:0%

the state of New Hampshire where we all
 
01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
live and I must say that after reading
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
this bill hearing the testimony reading
 
01:17:01.090 --> 01:17:01.100 align:start position:0%
the amendment listening to people today
 
01:17:03.649 --> 01:17:03.659 align:start position:0%
this bill is not ready as far as I'm
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
concerned it's not concise it's not
 
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
clear I understand many of the points
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
made by several speakers this is not
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
ready to go before the house and I will
 
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
not be supporting it thank you

will uh this will go to the floor

without recommendation so what I'm
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
looking for is uh somebody from
 
01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
one side and the other to write the
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee reports I'm assuming on our
 
01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:02.120 align:start position:0%
side it'll be representative power
 
01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative Elwood will write it for
 
01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
our side and representative stavis
 
01:32:12.290 --> 01:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
all right for the dissenting side
 
01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:27.110 align:start position:0%
