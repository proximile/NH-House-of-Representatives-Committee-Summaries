00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
uh I don't have my gavel oh
 
00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:02.459 align:start position:0%
we will now open the public hearing on
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
House Bill 297 and recognize
 
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
there thank you madam chair and
 
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
committee on I have a testimony which is
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
a little long so I'm not going to talk
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
most of it but I did want the many
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
people on this committee who are new
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
enough that you haven't been told what
 
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds are and why they belong
 
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
on what
 
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:50.990 align:start position:0%
on what
on

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
what has been going on for the last 20
 
00:11:57.889 --> 00:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
four years I think it is
 
00:11:57.899 --> 00:11:59.090 align:start position:0%
four years I think it is
on

00:11:59.090 --> 00:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
as we've corralled the dedicated funds
 
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.509 align:start position:0%
of the state
on

00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
but this bill is every single term
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
every single year the dedicated funds
 
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:19.100 align:start position:0%
committee gets together
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
and after
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
the chair talks with
 
00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
the person at Das who is handling the
 
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
reporting of dedicated funds there
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
and uh he we have a five-year cycle
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
through which every dedicated Fund in
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
the state goes on organized into
 
00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:47.660 align:start position:0%
agencies of the state
 
00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.610 align:start position:0%
agencies of the state
and

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
it took us a couple of of terms to
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
figure out what we were doing and get it
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
right and we started to get it right
 
00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.779 align:start position:0%
three years ago
 
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
and now where that is completely right I
 
00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
hope I think uh now now we're turning
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
out a spreadsheet along with the bill
 
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.650 align:start position:0%
out a spreadsheet along with the bill
every

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
every year that shows
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
what we did or didn't do with each of
 
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
the dedicated funds that was on our list
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
for that year
 
00:13:31.449 --> 00:13:31.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
just a part
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
of the spreadsheet for this time you can
 
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
find it under the dedicated funds
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
committee under statutory committees
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.030 align:start position:0%
um in
uh

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
for you and look at it for yourself it's
 
00:13:55.009 --> 00:13:55.019 align:start position:0%
more in the form of a draft than
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
than a final version because there can
 
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.110 align:start position:0%
than a final version because there can
frequently

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
observations or questions in the
 
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:07.220 align:start position:0%
comments section
 
00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.110 align:start position:0%
comments section
that

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
may be worthy of following up five years
 
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.449 align:start position:0%
may be worthy of following up five years
later

00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:14.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
on but there are also explanations in
 
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
the purpose and the funding source
 
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
that explain
 
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
very succinctly what that dedicated fund
 
00:14:28.509 --> 00:14:28.519 align:start position:0%
is there for
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
and where it's getting its money from
 
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
some of the comments tend to be on
 
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
this fund has been increasing the amount
 
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
of money in the fund for quite some time
 
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.790 align:start position:0%
of money in the fund for quite some time
and

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
they said that they're going to be
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
building a capital project soon or we
 
00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
didn't get any information from them
 
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
about that but we didn't have time and
 
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
so it's still a question
 
00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.069 align:start position:0%
so it's still a question
um

00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:58.079 --> 00:15:00.110 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.689 align:start position:0%
so
it's

00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:02.699 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:04.610 align:start position:0%
it's
that's

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:06.959 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet that goes along with the
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
annual report the annual report went in
 
00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
from representative major
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
last fall
 
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
and is under the statutory committee's
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds you just look up
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
but the dedicated funds of the state
 
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:32.420 align:start position:0%
are formed for a specific purpose
 
00:15:35.569 --> 00:15:35.579 align:start position:0%
they were planned to be funded either by
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
donations and grants or a specific fee
 
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:41.100 align:start position:0%
fine or penalty that is relevant to
 
00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.600 align:start position:0%
their purpose
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
but after early challenges the courts
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
allowed that relevance to be very broad
 
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
as long as the legislature has created
 
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
they defer to the legislature usually
 
00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
most active dedicated funds do have a
 
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
strong relevancy to the program that
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
they're supporting
 
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.569 align:start position:0%
they're supporting
and

00:16:10.569 --> 00:16:10.579 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
legislators put these in in an attempt
 
00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
to get funding or more funding for a
 
00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:19.019 align:start position:0%
wide range of causes that they fear the
 
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
current legislature or a future one will
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
choose not to support having other
 
00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:25.189 align:start position:0%
choose not to support having other
priorities

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
too many are put in saying they will get
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
funding from donors or grants or future
 
00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:32.339 align:start position:0%
Appropriations which never appear
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
it takes a lot of work to develop a
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
donor State stream or grants for
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
something that perhaps should have been
 
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
done by the state
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
or that people outside think should have
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
been done by the state
 
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.189 align:start position:0%
been done by the state
um

00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:48.720 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a warning that when our
 
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
committee does get new dedicated fund
 
00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.430 align:start position:0%
committee does get new dedicated fund
requests

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
requests
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
if it is not based on a specific fee or
 
00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:59.110 align:start position:0%
if it is not based on a specific fee or
other

00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
or appropriation that's actually
 
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
occurring or something like that we need
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
to look at them with a real BDI because
 
00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:09.049 align:start position:0%
to look at them with a real BDI because
otherwise

00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:09.059 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
five years later we're probably going to
 
00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
be repealing it
 
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds in the rules fall under
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
the purview of our committee
 
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:27.740 align:start position:0%
but the people who assigned the bills
 
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
frequently send them also to finance and
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
sometimes to other policy committees
 
00:17:34.919 --> 00:17:36.230 align:start position:0%
sometimes to other policy committees
so

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
um sometimes those we get as a second
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
committee sometimes we never see until
 
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
it gets to the dedicated fund committee
 
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
the dedicated fund committee includes
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
senators and house members and is has
 
00:17:52.919 --> 00:17:54.529 align:start position:0%
senators and house members and is has
been

00:17:54.529 --> 00:17:54.539 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
pretty much chaired by the chair of ways
 
00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:03.299 align:start position:0%
and means over the years I think once
 
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
I chaired it but then I appointed myself
 
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.770 align:start position:0%
I chaired it but then I appointed myself
Clerk

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
Clerk
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
and let representative major chair
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
because the spreadsheet gets done by the
 
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.210 align:start position:0%
because the spreadsheet gets done by the
clerk

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:17.220 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
and it's a lot of extra work
 
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.890 align:start position:0%
and it's a lot of extra work
so

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
the committee is is charged I've said
 
00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:32.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
this bill is the result of the second
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
year of the second cycle and covers the
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services the
 
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
lottery Liquor Commission the university
 
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire the courts and
 
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
in fact it's a fairly
 
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
slow moving
 
00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:54.539 align:start position:0%
um it
 
00:18:57.529 --> 00:18:57.539 align:start position:0%
the second year is a fairly light load
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
except for Environmental Services which
 
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
I was dreading but they are really good
 
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
at presenting themselves
 
00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
some of the Departments are not
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
and it's pulling teeth to get them to
 
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
figure out what they're doing and then
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.190 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.950 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:27.299 align:start position:0%
in the first cycle we didn't have our
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
act together yet and this year we asked
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
why we were treating
 
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission the Lottery
 
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
Commission and the university system as
 
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
part of our review they have separate
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
Audits and their cash flow goes directly
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
to segregated funds so they appear in
 
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
what I call the telephone book which is
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
about that thick when you have it
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
printed out and they hand us
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
the the printout on the committee but
 
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:00.419 align:start position:0%
everybody else looks it up online
 
00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:02.210 align:start position:0%
everybody else looks it up online
um

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
these these three
 
00:20:04.679 --> 00:20:06.470 align:start position:0%
these these three
um

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
the two commissions and the university
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
system appear in that book with zero
 
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
dollars and zero dollars occurred and
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
zero dollars at the end of the year and
 
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.430 align:start position:0%
zero dollars at the end of the year and
practically

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
practically
 
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
um no wording at all about their purpose
 
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
and their funding on
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
and that is because they do these
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
separate extensive audits
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
um which are separately reported
 
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.810 align:start position:0%
um which are separately reported
and

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
in the past we had simply removed the
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
Seabrook decommissioning fund from the
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
list of funds very early on because it
 
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
was obvious that that uh
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
it's I believe received all of the
 
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:54.500 align:start position:0%
monies that it needs
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
it cannot be touched
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
for very obvious reasons that if we
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
drain the Seabrook decommissioning fund
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
and Seabrook needs to be decommissioned
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's a huge amount of money
 
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
so it is off the book from anything that
 
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:15.980 align:start position:0%
we can or should do
 
00:21:21.289 --> 00:21:21.299 align:start position:0%
but our new comptroller asked that
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
similar funds and the lottery liquor and
 
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
University system
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
ought to be continue to be listed with
 
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
an asterisk which states why they are
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
exempt from reporting as a dedicated
 
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
fund and that is sections one to three
 
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
um we
 
00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:45.799 align:start position:0%
we removed them from a number of places
 
00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
and established
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
if I remember correctly
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
an asterisk
 
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.010 align:start position:0%
an asterisk
um

00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
yes on section one the following are
 
00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
Exempted from the reporting and review
 
00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:09.299 align:start position:0%
requirements of 612 e and 612j
 
00:22:09.299 --> 00:22:18.610 align:start position:0%
requirements of 612 e and 612j
and

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:18.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:22.100 align:start position:0%
the section four
 
00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:24.539 align:start position:0%
repeals a fund that was set up to accept
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
donations to the university system for
 
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.630 align:start position:0%
donations to the university system for
scholarships

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
scholarships
 
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
which were already being provided by the
 
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
under its regular student aid these were
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
specific for the children of
 
00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:45.419 align:start position:0%
deceased firefighters and police that
 
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
were killed in action I believe
 
00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.330 align:start position:0%
were killed in action I believe
and

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
and the university system was already
 
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
so nobody directed any donations to this
 
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
fund on the University system kept doing
 
00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:06.299 align:start position:0%
it and they said uh
 
00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:09.059 align:start position:0%
why don't you get it away I mean why
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
don't you remove it I will say I
 
00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:16.919 align:start position:0%
expected there to be a Amendment
 
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
um this morning
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
which I guess is going to have to be
 
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
there was something left out
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
on in
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
the final version of this which I did
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
not read carefully enough and compare
 
00:23:39.529 --> 00:23:39.539 align:start position:0%
with the spreadsheet notes on there is a
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
section in 187 a 20 a
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
Roman 2.
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
which is dedicated fund to 78 which says
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
this fund is created and is doing the
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
following work and that needs to be
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
removed since we're removing it from 612
 
00:24:06.529 --> 00:24:06.539 align:start position:0%
and since it doesn't do anything
 
00:24:06.539 --> 00:24:08.210 align:start position:0%
and since it doesn't do anything
so

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
um that's going to have to
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
um I thought that that we had that
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
coming out it should be coming out of
 
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.450 align:start position:0%
coming out it should be coming out of
drafting

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
drafting
 
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
fairly soon uh gen Force said she'd take
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
care of it
 
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.970 align:start position:0%
care of it
so

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
um but it's that kind of detail work
 
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.570 align:start position:0%
um but it's that kind of detail work
that

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:30.950 align:start position:0%
that
that

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
cleaning up our statutes that the
 
00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:37.820 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds committee does most of
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
section five repeals of funds set up for
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
grateful citizens to donate to the Cold
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
Case homicide attorney who works at
 
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:48.539 align:start position:0%
Justice or who should be working at
 
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
Justice I think the position's still
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
vacant but the man retired
 
00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:57.500 align:start position:0%
in over five years only one 100
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
contribution has been recorded and the
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
department was instructed by us to find
 
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
a way to spend it on some Cold Case
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
issue and thank the donor before this
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
bill comes into effect next January
 
00:25:15.049 --> 00:25:15.059 align:start position:0%
so that we could
 
00:25:18.409 --> 00:25:18.419 align:start position:0%
avoid having to send it to the general
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
fund when the donor was told that this
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
was going to be for cold cases
 
00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:24.769 align:start position:0%
was going to be for cold cases
um

00:25:24.769 --> 00:25:24.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
we spent
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
15 minutes discussing that but
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:36.419 align:start position:0%
and then section 6 is just the effective
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
date which is the beginning of next year
 
00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.269 align:start position:0%
date which is the beginning of next year
to

00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:25:41.279 --> 00:25:42.470 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure why it's the
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
beginning of next year I can't remember
 
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.570 align:start position:0%
beginning of next year I can't remember
but

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
but that's it for the bill
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative would you
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
go into questions yes uh representative
 
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.210 align:start position:0%
go into questions yes uh representative
ulry

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.220 align:start position:0%

00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:25:59.690 --> 00:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative Olney
 
00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:03.539 align:start position:0%
so just to distill this down
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
this gets rid of
 
00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:06.769 align:start position:0%
this gets rid of
redundant

00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
uh funds
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
right or just use funds or unused funds
 
00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
this only is removing it's not adding or
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
it's not adding what it does do
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes is to get and last last year
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
we the year before last we had done this
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh to get the Departments to say oh
 
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
we've got this money here why do we
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
still have that money here how can we
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
best use it and
 
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
um two years ago we got
 
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.490 align:start position:0%
um two years ago we got
uh

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:45.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
safety I believe it was to on
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
take the money that they had in two
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
separate funds on
 
00:26:59.330 --> 00:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
that had been accumulating gradually
 
00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:03.299 align:start position:0%
over the years and on was no longer
 
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
receiving money
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
to on spend in a
 
00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:12.299 align:start position:0%
version of the program that they were
 
00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:15.500 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing that will
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
essentially create a base for the future
 
00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:21.620 align:start position:0%
without having to spend any more money
 
00:27:23.769 --> 00:27:23.779 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
follow up and then representative plate
 
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
just uh line 19 uh paragraph five uh
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
since I was co-sponsor of the original
 
00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:35.510 align:start position:0%
since I was co-sponsor of the original
bill

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
and I know that this was put in
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
specifically at the request of numerous
 
00:27:42.769 --> 00:27:42.779 align:start position:0%
individuals you're not telling me that
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
one hundred dollars
 
00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
one hundred dollars
yeah

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what happened unless
 
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
do you have a question at least one
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
individual feels strongly enough that
 
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
they dedicate a lot of their time to
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
going out and getting people to provide
 
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
contributions they don't do it yeah
 
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you manager um representative
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I understand this is
 
00:28:15.169 --> 00:28:15.179 align:start position:0%
essentially a housekeeping Bill to
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
continue review okay good
 
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
um you raise my eyebrows with a Seabrook
 
00:28:21.289 --> 00:28:21.299 align:start position:0%
fund I thought that was at a federal
 
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
level uh so uh there are two funds One
 
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
Federal one state on well the state was
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
responsible as I I mean this was this
 
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
was back about 10 years ago when we
 
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
discussed this so I'm not quite sure of
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
my facts but I think that this is the
 
00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
sole decommissioning fund and it is in
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
some way on the state's books
 
00:28:53.169 --> 00:28:53.179 align:start position:0%
and the state on assessed as I recall
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
on the nuclear plant for years and
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
probably still is assessing it a little
 
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.370 align:start position:0%
probably still is assessing it a little
um

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:03.649 --> 00:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there's sufficient
 
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
money in there to do the full
 
00:29:08.269 --> 00:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
decommissioning as has been done for
 
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:11.460 align:start position:0%
Vermont Yankee in the last few years
 
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:13.260 align:start position:0%
picked up a neck and my life has been in
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.889 --> 00:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions yes
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives Pillsbury
 
00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
so it
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
I think this is obvious I just want to
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
be absolutely sure there are only two
 
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
funds that this bill terminates
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
and that's in article four and five
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
those two other skills this year that's
 
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
the least we've had for quite a while
 
00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:42.539 align:start position:0%
actually okay so everything in our
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
sections one two and three is purely for
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose of exempting reporting
 
00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
requirements that's the thrust of the
 
00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.769 align:start position:0%
requirements that's the thrust of the
bill

00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
um when you do your Amendment
 
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
line 17
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
you could delete relative to where it
 
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
appears twice excuse me what was that
 
00:30:06.769 --> 00:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
because the amendment's already being
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
done yeah page two line 17 has a
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh oh relative to relative two yes it
 
00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.789 align:start position:0%
uh oh relative to relative two yes it
does

00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we can get that
 
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.490 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we can get that
deleted

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
deleted
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
I'll try thank you
 
00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:27.539 align:start position:0%
a question from me if you just just to
 
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
be sure this amendment will be
 
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
completely germane to the original Bill
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
oh yes great thank you definitely uh
 
00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:36.059 align:start position:0%
representative has a question yes thank
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you representative
 
00:30:40.909 --> 00:30:40.919 align:start position:0%
only just um understanding the liquor
 
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
lottery in University system are part of
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
this Exempted reporting because they're
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
doing their own audits anyway there's
 
00:30:48.049 --> 00:30:48.059 align:start position:0%
something about the fish and game in
 
00:30:48.059 --> 00:30:48.830 align:start position:0%
something about the fish and game in
there

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
um are they auditing themselves are they
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
doing audits as well because I see that
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
that's they're Exempted as well
 
00:30:59.930 --> 00:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
yeah and and this was done who who was
 
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
Exempted got pulled out of the files by
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
the Comptroller
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
the fishing game fund uh I would like to
 
00:31:12.289 --> 00:31:12.299 align:start position:0%
see their audits frankly I've never seen
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
a fishing game audit and they have a
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
very complicated series of Which is less
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
complicated than used to be of of sub
 
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:25.100 align:start position:0%
funds that we do get to take a look at
 
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:29.240 align:start position:0%
but or we have gotten to take a look at
 
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
but they have this General overall fund
 
00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:37.799 align:start position:0%
that I
 
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:42.260 align:start position:0%
do not I was on division one in finance
 
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
20 years ago something and
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
and we did have fish and game in our
 
00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:52.740 align:start position:0%
purview as I recall we certainly had to
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
fight about their bills and
 
00:31:59.570 --> 00:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
I don't remember us spending very much
 
00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:03.299 align:start position:0%
time on their fund at that point though
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
later on it turned out that fishing game
 
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
The Fish and Game fund was being very if
 
00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
the management was very difficult
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.529 --> 00:32:18.539 align:start position:0%
uh representative ulery if there are no
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.049 --> 00:32:24.059 align:start position:0%
let's go around first time first so
 
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm just trying to understand
 
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking at here in in on that
 
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
fish and game issue on line 10.
 
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
that's an account that where they put
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
money received from
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
fines and and
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
you know some kind of penalties
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
is the intent to eliminate that account
 
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
so that if somebody were to ask the
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
question you know how much revenue did
 
00:32:58.850 --> 00:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
you bring in from fines they would not
 
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
be able to answer that question
 
00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
um it does not eliminate the account
 
00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
what it does is it
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
says it will say with an asterisk the FI
 
00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:12.659 align:start position:0%
this is Exempted from the reporting and
 
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
review requirements of 612 e and 612j I
 
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
would have been uh
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
and 612 e and J are the dedicated fund
 
00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.190 align:start position:0%
and 612 e and J are the dedicated fund
review

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.220 align:start position:0%
where it is reviewed is as the fish and
 
00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
game fund inside of Finance
 
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
and the accounting that has to be done
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
separately by the Auditors that do the
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
cat I think the Auditors that do the
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
kafir on continues and the finance
 
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
responsibility continues
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
but what the only thing that the
 
00:33:57.409 --> 00:33:57.419 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund committee has seen is the
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
zero zero zero charts
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
on because the fund is considered to be
 
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh yes so I I thought I said I
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
understood until you made that last
 
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.010 align:start position:0%
understood until you made that last
comment

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
so all of these These funds have
 
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
balances of zero or they at the end of
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
the year they have only for the
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds purposes
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
they are accounted for separately under
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
the state accounting system
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
and they are audited separately during
 
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
the um kafir audit
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
the the comprehensive Financial annual
 
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.310 align:start position:0%
the the comprehensive Financial annual
Financial

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
thank you review report whatever it is
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
any other first time questions
 
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none representative ulery
 
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
you may uh former representative Ober
 
00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:14.390 align:start position:0%
you may uh former representative Ober
Rand

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
Rand
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
because the Liquor Commission didn't
 
00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:20.099 align:start position:0%
bother to do any accounting
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh in essence uh I don't think it was
 
00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:26.579 align:start position:0%
that bad was it yeah I I'm trying to
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
remember it took that subpoena from the
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
commission to get them to to give us any
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
information because they said they
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
but that's one of the reasons that the
 
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
this was put in there are you now saying
 
00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
that they are under the reorganization
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
actually providing uh information
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh in an accounting fashion that can be
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
seen either by the public or legislators
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
well I'm saying that they are providing
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
no information to the dedicated funds
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
committee commission what I need here is
 
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
the Comptroller to explain herself
 
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if we'd want to call
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
her for a work session
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
it might be good to all right yeah that
 
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
might be helpful to do a follow-up on
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you thank
 
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
are there any other pink cards for house
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
bill 297.
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
could I just make a comment this is just
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
the most questions I think we have ever
 
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.770 align:start position:0%
the most questions I think we have ever
had

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
okay we're some of us are still learning
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
about this so we'll do a little work
 
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
session as a full committee to learn a
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
this representative Ames before you
 
00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
close this uh
 
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
I think maybe a word needs to be said
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
that all the work that representative
 
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
almi has done over the years has been
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
complemented and she's been in
 
00:36:59.530 --> 00:36:59.540 align:start position:0%
partnership with representative major
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
who together they've done extraordinary
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
work in pulling together uh information
 
00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
that just wasn't attended to in the past
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
and cleaning up
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
uh you know a series of accounts that
 
00:37:13.849 --> 00:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
needed to be cleaned up so that's I
 
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
think that should be on the record thank
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%

00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:08.099 align:start position:0%

profits tax BPT
 
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
for those new to some of the issues that
 
00:39:14.089 --> 00:39:14.099 align:start position:0%
come before this committee the net
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
operating loss made its appearance here
 
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
last session historically in 2014 a
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
commission to study business taxes was
 
00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
formed that included the study of the
 
00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
carryover and deductions of the net
 
00:39:29.089 --> 00:39:29.099 align:start position:0%
operating loss to assess its tax policy
 
00:39:31.849 --> 00:39:31.859 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain a balance between
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
competitiveness and Revenue
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
the three criteria used to measure the
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
competitiveness of each State's
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
corporate tax base are given equal
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
weight one the availability of certain
 
00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
credits deductions and exemptions to the
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
ability of taxpayers to deduct their net
 
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
operating loss and three a host of
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
smaller tax-based issues the federal
 
00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
corporate income tax and New Hampshire's
 
00:39:59.569 --> 00:39:59.579 align:start position:0%
business profits tax is designed to tax
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
only the profits of a corporation
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
however a yearly profit snapshot may not
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
fully capture a corporation's true
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
profitability for example a corporation
 
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
in a highly cyclical industry may look
 
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
very profitable during the boom years
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
but lose substantial
 
00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
amounts during the bust years when
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
examined over the entire business cycle
 
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
the corporation may actually have an
 
00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
average profit margin examples of
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
cyclical Industries those are things you
 
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
can live with or without or travel
 
00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
construction hotels luxury goods
 
00:40:39.849 --> 00:40:39.859 align:start position:0%
Airlines Etc the non-cyclical industries
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
things you probably always need are
 
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
utilities Health Care Consumer Staples
 
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
like toothpaste soap Etc
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
the deduction for net operating loss
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
helps ensure that over time the
 
00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099 align:start position:0%
corporate income tax is a tax on the
 
00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
average of profitability
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
this is especially true for New
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses that suffer losses
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
either from starting up or during tough
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
Economic Times without the nol deduction
 
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
corporations and a cyclical industry
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
Industries pay much higher taxes than
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
those in stable Industries even assuming
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
identical average profits over time
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
simply put the nol deduction helps to
 
00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
level the playing field among cyclical
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
and non-cyclical industries
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
we here in the new in the house Ways and
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
Means have tried to provide an Optimum
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
business tax climate for New Hampshire
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
in the past few years there have been a
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
lot of tax legislation all under the
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
heading to promote our New Hampshire tax
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
advantage and improve our business
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
climate and the examples include a
 
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
decrease in business tax rates single

00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
I have heard members of our legislature
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
speak ill of the tax laws made in
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
Washington D.C that affect our residents
 
00:42:07.849 --> 00:42:07.859 align:start position:0%
and businesses the tax Foundation has
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
rated the New Hampshire business tax
 
00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:12.380 align:start position:0%
climate concerning the New Hampshire nol
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
as some of the worst in the nation as to
 
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
corporate taxes
 
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
here we are trying to promote the New
 
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tax advantage yet in 20
 
00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
21 through 2022 session the legislature
 
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
voted to only allow up to 80 percent of
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
the federal taxable income as the cap on
 
00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:37.220 align:start position:0%
nol deductions by conforming to section
 
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
172 of the IRC in effect on or after
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
December 31st 2018.
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
this change is not a great this change
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
is not a great climate for small
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
businesses or startup businesses that
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
often lose money in the first few years
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
we are taxing them with the bet
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
but now are also limiting their nol
 
00:43:05.809 --> 00:43:05.819 align:start position:0%
deductions which can have devastating
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
effect in their short and long-term
 
00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.730 align:start position:0%
effect in their short and long-term
viability

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:10.740 align:start position:0%

businesses of New Hampshire are crucial
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
the dra interprets the change to the
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
eighty percent limitation of the nol as
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
follows a reduction in net operating
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
loss deduction taken by the taxpayer
 
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
increases tax revenues for the state
 
00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:54.740 align:start position:0%
I see this as a tax and a tax increase
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
upon the taxpayer the businesses of New
 
00:43:58.319 --> 00:43:59.150 align:start position:0%
upon the taxpayer the businesses of New
Hampshire

00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
the solution to this tax increase is
 
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
that the house Ways and Means Committee
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
should not force the New Hampshire
 
00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:07.859 align:start position:0%
business Community especially the small
 
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
businesses and the startups to pay their
 
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
BPT before they fully utilize their nol
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
deduction carry forwards as has been
 
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
allowed by the law up until 2022.
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
this bill for BPT purposes does not
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
change the carry forward of 10 years
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
which Most states allow 20 years
 
00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
and secondly the amount of nol generated
 
00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:36.839 align:start position:0%
in a tax year that can be carried
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
forward may not exceed 10 million
 
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
this bill only asks at the nol deduction
 
00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
up to 80 percent of taxable income be
 
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.809 align:start position:0%
up to 80 percent of taxable income be
changed

00:44:47.809 --> 00:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:50.099 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let the next expert handle
 
00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
the technical questions I sure are going
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
to be coming
 
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
from this group and that's Jim ucelo
 
00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.220 align:start position:0%

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
cards so if they're out there please
 
00:45:08.329 --> 00:45:08.339 align:start position:0%

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
out for me uh may I ask you a question
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
though Madam chair you can always ask
 
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
her thank you so much
 
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
um we I have requested some legislative
 
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
history from our researcher but can you
 
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell explain where did this
 
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
bill get passed was it is a house bill a
 
00:45:25.370 --> 00:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
Senate bill when did it happen because
 
00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
if this never made it to my radar the
 
00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
change to conform with IRC
 
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I have a little story to
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
tell you okay
 
00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
first it was voted and approved here to
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
have the change and I was the only
 
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
representative that voted against it
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
it then moved forward to the house
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
and it was almost the last bill of the
 
00:45:48.599 --> 00:45:49.609 align:start position:0%
and it was almost the last bill of the
day

00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
back in May or June I believe and
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
I had made my presentation the
 
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
opposition came up and said it's a 19-1
 
00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:02.839 align:start position:0%
vote let's vote
 
00:46:08.329 --> 00:46:08.339 align:start position:0%
and I did make this presentation
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
during that time period
 
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.010 align:start position:0%
during that time period
so

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
that's when it happened and you were in
 
00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:17.180 align:start position:0%
the front row I think somewhere
 
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:20.700 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much you're welcome
 
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
well good morning my name is Jim uselio
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
I live in Hollis and as um
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative said I think I'm really
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
here to help illustrate the issue and
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
you know give you technical guidance
 
00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.190 align:start position:0%
you know give you technical guidance
um

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how much history you want
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
on this issue or just jump into the
 
00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.589 align:start position:0%
on this issue or just jump into the
example

00:47:00.589 --> 00:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:47:00.599 --> 00:47:01.190 align:start position:0%
example
um

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
I think I probably should take a few
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
minutes to go over the history just a
 
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
tad so again when we say net operating
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
loss that's a business's deductions over
 
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
their income and so often what happens
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
is a business will either during a Downy
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
or recession or maybe in a startup yeah
 
00:47:20.329 --> 00:47:20.339 align:start position:0%
they often lose money so they may have a
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
loss in one year and incoming in next
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
year and so when a business files a tax
 
00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
return again they pay taxes on their
 
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
income and so this net operating loss
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
deduction under the Internal Revenue
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
code and I think probably every state
 
00:47:36.609 --> 00:47:36.619 align:start position:0%
has one is really a means to kind of
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
take into account that businesses income
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
goes up some years and down some years
 
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
and so the nol is meant to kind of
 
00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
smooth that over and so
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
this I'll call it a glitch if you will
 
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
um you may know that under the BBT we
 
00:47:53.809 --> 00:47:53.819 align:start position:0%
use our reference to the Internal
 
00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
Revenue code changes every few years and
 
00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
right now we use the 18 code and that's
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
in figuring out gross business profits
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
the Nano and the gross business profits
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
is before the net operating loss
 
00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:08.220 align:start position:0%
deduction so you start out with gross
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
business profits you have some
 
00:48:11.329 --> 00:48:11.339 align:start position:0%
adjustments you will push in your income
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
and then you basically layer in the net
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
operating loss deduction and so the net
 
00:48:18.589 --> 00:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
operating loss deduction had always been
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
well at least since 1996 it was tied to
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
the 96 section 172 which basically just
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
meant when you when you a business
 
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
calculates their income in New Hampshire
 
00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
they follow the 18 code for the gross
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
business profits but then in this quote
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
one that's a net operating loss
 
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
deduction they follow the 96 code which
 
00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
again just says basically you can deduct
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
your nol
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
um and so excuse me last year
 
00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.829 align:start position:0%
um and so excuse me last year
when

00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:46.910 align:start position:0%
when
um

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
this reference to in 7784
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 13.
 
00:48:55.609 --> 00:48:55.619 align:start position:0%
it used to say that the um as you can
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
see in the bill
 
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
it references 172 in the eternal revenue
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
code it used to say 172
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
um in effect in 1996. and that's
 
00:49:07.609 --> 00:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
important because under the tax cuts and
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
jobs act in 2017 when under the um
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
federal law we had a whole bunch of tax
 
00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.410 align:start position:0%
federal law we had a whole bunch of tax
cuts

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
cuts
 
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
one of the one I call a revenue raiser
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
was limiting the amount of the net
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
operating loss under federal law and so
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
basically what that meant was a business
 
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
that has nll is that they used to be
 
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
able to utilize against their income
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
they now had this cap they just put in
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
the 80 cap and so
 
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
by us adopting for 172 purposes the 18
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
code we've now conformed to that
 
00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.190 align:start position:0%
code we've now conformed to that
provision

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
and so we are stuck with that unless we
 
00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:43.740 align:start position:0%
kind of decide we don't want that
 
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
anymore and again that could change if
 
00:49:47.569 --> 00:49:47.579 align:start position:0%
the federal government says well we're
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
going to cap it at 50 we'd be tied to
 
00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
the Internal Revenue code so it's really
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
what you want to do
 
00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:53.750 align:start position:0%
what you want to do
[Music]

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.349 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
I'll also say under the same tax cuts
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
and jobs act in 2017 when they put in
 
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
this 80 cap they also changed the carry
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
forward period
 
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
how long a business can use their net
 
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
operating losses from 20 years to an
 
00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
indefinite carry forward provision and
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
so that's important at least they did
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
that right they put in a cap but they
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
said we'll let businesses carry forward
 
00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
their nols indefinitely
 
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
we would have adopted that as well
 
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
because we're adopting the 18 code for
 
00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:26.099 align:start position:0%
172 purposes but the reason why we don't
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
adopt that provision is when you look at
 
00:50:31.849 --> 00:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
our statute under 77 A4 Roman numeral 13
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
we explicitly have a 10-year carry
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
forward period as well as we have a 10
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
million dollar cap so we have these
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
other I'll call
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
less than favorable issues
 
00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
and so at least under the federal law
 
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
not that I would Advocate it but again
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
when they put in this 80 cap again they
 
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
changed the carry forward from 20 years
 
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
to indefinite we can't we don't adopt
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
that because we explicitly have a
 
00:50:57.950 --> 00:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
10-year carry forward so we're not only
 
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
getting stuck with the 80 limitation we
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
still have this 10-year carry forward
 
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
and we still have a 10 million dollar
 
00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:05.579 align:start position:0%
cap so that's really just some context
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
that I think is important
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
um but I don't want to kind of lose
 
00:51:12.849 --> 00:51:12.859 align:start position:0%
sight of the big picture here which is
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
how this law is going to work going
 
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.190 align:start position:0%
how this law is going to work going
forward

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.089 align:start position:0%
forward
um

00:51:17.089 --> 00:51:17.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
it so I think the best thing to do is
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
let me walk you through an example and I
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
think it'll help illustrate the issue
 
00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:26.339 align:start position:0%
and so my example it's pretty basic but
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
I really wanted to drive home the point
 
00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
here excuse me so if you have a business
 
00:51:33.049 --> 00:51:33.059 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and in year one maybe
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's a startup company or not but if if
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
you have a business it could be small or
 
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
large and it loses money so my example I
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
have two examples I should say the first
 
00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:44.220 align:start position:0%
example is how the law used to walk
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
right up into 2022 so it changes in
 
00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
2022. and then the second example is how
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
it now works going forward
 
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
and so if you have a company that loses
 
00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
300 000 in my example in year one and
 
00:51:59.690 --> 00:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
then make 150 000 over the next three
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
years you can see cumulatively that they
 
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
would make 150 000 Over a four-year
 
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.470 align:start position:0%
would make 150 000 Over a four-year
period

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
now just kind of step back and so what
 
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
the yellow deduction is meant to do is
 
00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:13.020 align:start position:0%
it says okay in year one my business
 
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
loses money it could lose a hundred
 
00:52:16.609 --> 00:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or 300 000 whatever the
 
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
number is and then you get two it starts
 
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:20.220 align:start position:0%
to turn the corner things get better so
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
it makes a little bit of money so it
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
makes a hundred fifty thousand dollars
 
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
so what the law had always been was okay
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
well will that because income goes up
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
and down we'll let that business take
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
that 300 000 loss and carry forward
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
until they use it and then they'll stop
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
paying taxes and so in 2022 under my
 
00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
example they can use 150 of that 300 000
 
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
loss next year they make another 150. so
 
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
as of the end of three years they break
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
even they use the remainder of that loss
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
150 000. now they have no more nol
 
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
deduction left and then whatever they
 
00:52:56.809 --> 00:52:56.819 align:start position:0%
make they pay taxes on so they make 150
 
00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
in 2024 and they stop paying taxes
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the big picture and
 
00:53:04.609 --> 00:53:04.619 align:start position:0%
to me that makes sense because that
 
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
business isn't starting to pay taxes and
 
00:53:07.609 --> 00:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
still they've stopped making a
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
cumulative amount of money I mean it
 
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
would be really unfair that you sit
 
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
there and say okay well if you lose 300
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
000 in the year one and you make 150 000
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
in year two you're still down you still
 
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:19.740 align:start position:0%
lost money since you've been in business
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
but we're going to make you pay taxes
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's what the law change does and you
 
00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
can see that in the second example what
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
now happens and you can see under
 
00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
example two I put it in bold the less of
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
those are the key words
 
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
that same business loses 300 000 in the
 
00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
year two it starts to make some money so
 
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
it makes 150. now unlike the first
 
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:41.210 align:start position:0%
it makes 150. now unlike the first
example

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:43.740 align:start position:0%
they can only deduct that deduction is
 
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
limited to the lesson of the carryover
 
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
so 300 000 or 80 percent of their income
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
in that year so eighty percent of the
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
income in 2022 is 120 000 so the lesson
 
00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
of is a hundred and twenty thousand
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
dollars so they can only deduct 120 000
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
even though they have a 300 000 and a
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
while sitting on their books they can
 
00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
only because the government said we're
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
going to put eighty percent of the cap
 
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
they can only deduct 120. so they end up
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
paying tax on thirty thousand dollars in
 
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
year two
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
again you have a business that it could
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
have lost a million dollars in year one
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
make fifty thousand dollars in the year
 
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:19.980 align:start position:0%
two this is going to make them stop
 
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
paying taxes in year two even though
 
00:54:23.809 --> 00:54:23.819 align:start position:0%
they just lost a million dollars and
 
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
they make fifty thousand dollars in year
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
two because they have this cap and so if
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
you just do that math across in year
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
three again so now they had a 300 000
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
nol they used 120 that leaves 180 same
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
thing the less of 120 or 180 well it's
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
120 so then they pay taxes again so at
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
the end of year three they've only
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
broken even yet they've paid taxes on
 
00:54:46.849 --> 00:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollars their income and
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
then in the year four they use the
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
remainder and the remained is 60 and
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
because 60 is the lesser of the the cap
 
00:54:56.089 --> 00:54:56.099 align:start position:0%
of 120 in my example then they get to
 
00:54:58.089 --> 00:54:58.099 align:start position:0%
use it all so you can kind of just see
 
00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
in both examples they use the three
 
00:55:03.230 --> 00:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars but it's capped
 
00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.099 align:start position:0%
in the second example so they have to
 
00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
use it over a long period of time they
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
start paying taxes earlier so that's
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
really the takeaway here that
 
00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.410 align:start position:0%
really the takeaway here that
um

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
I guess it's kind of a fundamental
 
00:55:17.089 --> 00:55:17.099 align:start position:0%
question is that what we want that a
 
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
business loses money and then it can
 
00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
lose a million dollars and then it makes
 
00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars the next year
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to pay taxes on
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
that ten thousand dollars because they
 
00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
can't use all their nol and so again it
 
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839 align:start position:0%
could change it's 80 now it's a
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
government if the IRS says it's 50 to 90
 
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
would be tied to it so the bill
 
00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
basically just strikes this limitation
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
and goes back to the way it used to be
 
00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
um I also just wanted to point out and I
 
00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
let the dra speak to the fiscal note but
 
00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:48.059 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how the dra calculated
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
and again I don't want to speak for them
 
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
and they can clarify it but
 
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:55.140 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if they took like the total
 
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
amount of nols on their books and then
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
multiply times 80 and and use that as
 
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
kind of a base but to me there's no
 
00:56:04.849 --> 00:56:04.859 align:start position:0%
issue here at all really I mean I know
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
I know maybe it's prudent to try to have
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
a worst case fiscal note
 
00:56:11.089 --> 00:56:11.099 align:start position:0%
but I don't even think and I would
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
understand that but I don't think it's
 
00:56:14.569 --> 00:56:14.579 align:start position:0%
realistic at all because
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
if you just think about it first of all
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
I think the dra would agree this is the
 
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
cap so of the population of nols in the
 
00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:22.549 align:start position:0%
cap so of the population of nols in the
state

00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of businesses this isn't even
 
00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
going to matter because they're going to
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
be under the cap if a business loses 50
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
000 in year one and it makes 500 000 a
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
year too they're going to be under the
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
cap the Cap's not going to apply because
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
80 of 500 000 is 400 000 so they're
 
00:56:39.410 --> 00:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
going to be well under the cap so by
 
00:56:41.329 --> 00:56:41.339 align:start position:0%
just looking at the NLOS on the on the
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
dra's books
 
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
some population isn't even going to be
 
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
affected by that at all because they're
 
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
already under the cap it's only if
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
they're if they're subject to the cap
 
00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
because of the where the income is
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
like my example and in that case it's
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
just a timing issue you can see how it
 
00:56:58.970 --> 00:56:58.980 align:start position:0%
just plays out it's whether you use it
 
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
until you stop making money again or you
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
just put a cap on it and you stretch it
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
out longer so it's a timing issue it's
 
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
not a permanent issue and again I know
 
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
no one can project taxable income and
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
all that it's kind of a shot in a dock
 
00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
but it it's not a prominent issue that's
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
really the key Point here it's a timing
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
issue it's when the state's allowing a
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
business to take their nols under
 
00:57:23.329 --> 00:57:23.339 align:start position:0%
example one how it used to be or now to
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
this cap
 
00:57:26.329 --> 00:57:26.339 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
I think that's really everything that I
 
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:29.640 align:start position:0%
had and I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
technical questions or any questions at
 
00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.270 align:start position:0%
technical questions or any questions at
all

00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
I actually have a question because we
 
00:57:35.809 --> 00:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
don't operate in a vacuum here in New
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so what are other states doing
 
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
did everyone else take a line with the
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
IRC new IRC code or yeah it's a good
 
00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
question thank you I it's I would say
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's all over the place I mean again we
 
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
we we're tied to the 18 code many states
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
have a low income for me so they're tied
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
to the most recent code so this is at
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
the 18. there's been changes since the
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
18 code we had the chaos activists
 
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
change things
 
00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.870 align:start position:0%
change things
um

00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
but again
 
00:58:06.829 --> 00:58:06.839 align:start position:0%
so that's one factor that tied to
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
different codes I'd say
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
um some states are adopting it and then
 
00:58:13.849 --> 00:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
some states are not adopting a
 
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
decoupling from it I'd also say that
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
again other states don't have a 10
 
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
million cap they also don't have a
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
10-year carry forward so if they're
 
00:58:25.730 --> 00:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
going to adopt the 80 Captain they're
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
probably adopting the
 
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
um indefinite carry forward provision
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
because it's part of the same section
 
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
172 under the 2018 code it's the same
 
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
thing so so it kind of is all over the
 
00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:38.690 align:start position:0%
thing so so it kind of is all over the
place

00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
I see some hands up over here
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
representative Ames did you have a
 
00:58:42.599 --> 00:58:45.589 align:start position:0%
representative Ames did you have a
question

00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for your
 
00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.530 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for your
testimony

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering also
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
um sort of it's this is a follow-up from
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
the chairs question
 
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering also about what
 
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
Congress said when they chose to provide
 
00:59:05.569 --> 00:59:05.579 align:start position:0%
for an indefinite period as well as an
 
00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
80 limitation
 
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
um in support there's there's usually a
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
committee report on changes like this
 
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
and whether you've seen that whether you
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
could provide that to us it would be
 
00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:19.700 align:start position:0%
helpful to have background on why
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
they made these choices
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
right I don't I can't speak to that
 
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
maybe I can find a committee report
 
00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:28.609 align:start position:0%
maybe I can find a committee report
um

00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
right I I again my own kind of what I've
 
00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
read is basically many people saw that
 
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
as a revenue raiser because the tax cuts
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
and jobs Act of 2017 logically decreased
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
taxes and so this raised Revenue
 
00:59:43.559 --> 00:59:45.170 align:start position:0%
taxes and so this raised Revenue
um

00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
again it I guess it stabilizes the
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
revenue social Mr state right because if
 
00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
you look at my example again everything
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
else being equal it's great for the
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
state because they get this profit
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
coming in taxes being paid a lot earlier
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
than it would otherwise be be paid and
 
01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:01.740 align:start position:0%
so that's really to me the fundamental
 
01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:03.900 align:start position:0%
question you can see in the year two in
 
01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.349 align:start position:0%
question you can see in the year two in
2022

01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
you're making this business pay taxes on
 
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand dollars even though
 
01:00:12.049 --> 01:00:12.059 align:start position:0%
cumulatively over the two years they've
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
lost money that's kind of the
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
fundamental question the state will
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise get it just it's just a matter
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
of when it's after they used a net
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
operating losses in order versus having
 
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
this cap
 
01:00:24.049 --> 01:00:24.059 align:start position:0%
um yeah and it's right with the
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
indefinite carry forward Parisian again
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
I'll see what I can find my my kind of
 
01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
take on that was It was kind of
 
01:00:32.049 --> 01:00:32.059 align:start position:0%
part and parcel that
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
they put a cap on it but they they
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
loosen their 20 to carry forward to
 
01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:38.089 align:start position:0%
loosen their 20 to carry forward to
indefinite

01:00:38.089 --> 01:00:38.099 align:start position:0%
indefinite
 
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
again we would have otherwise adopted
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
that but we have a specific provision
 
01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
that only says a 10-year carry forward
 
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.190 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
spilsbury
 
01:00:51.049 --> 01:00:51.059 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that Congress has made
 
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
further changes in the Internal Revenue
 
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
code since 2018 but have they made any
 
01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:02.339 align:start position:0%
changes regarding the nols
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
I mean they have yes and no it's it's
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
so the 70 is still what they did
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
basically was we they put this in place
 
01:01:16.849 --> 01:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
as a 2017 so it was going to be the law
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
as of 18 but then we had the pandemic
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
and so when the epidemic hit they had
 
01:01:23.890 --> 01:01:23.900 align:start position:0%
the cares act and so for 18 19 and 20
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
they they
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
um temporarily suppress the 80
 
01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
limitation they said it was 100 again
 
01:01:33.049 --> 01:01:33.059 align:start position:0%
for those three years now in 2021
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
forward it's back to 80 percent so
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
so the law currently is the same as what
 
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
we've adopted last year by conforming to
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
the 18th vote right so right so now
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much for your
 
01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.730 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much for your
testimony

01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:01:57.049 --> 01:01:57.059 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative
 
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
um Do You Remember
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
this came from the Senate
 
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
do you remember how they were uh why
 
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
they were
 
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
defending this in particular and or how
 
01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
they did it here which I'm afraid I've
 
01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:21.950 align:start position:0%
they did it here which I'm afraid I've
forgotten

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
forgotten
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
so so I'm I'm gonna go on and I'm here
 
01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
so what I recall was right so this was
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 435.
 
01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
um so this was the bill that fixed the
 
01:02:34.609 --> 01:02:34.619 align:start position:0%
apportionment issue which was a great
 
01:02:34.619 --> 01:02:35.809 align:start position:0%
apportionment issue which was a great
fix

01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:35.819 align:start position:0%
fix
 
01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:36.470 align:start position:0%
fix
um

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
in that when that build language changed
 
01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
I think I don't know maybe it just
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
inadvertently they just they saw a 1996
 
01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
reference date to section 172 and they
 
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
just someone just Struck it
 
01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.049 align:start position:0%
just someone just Struck it
um

01:02:51.049 --> 01:02:51.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
and that had an impact maybe it wasn't
 
01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
recognized immediately but anytime you
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
change the reference to the Internal
 
01:02:59.030 --> 01:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue code it's going to have an
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
impact and so that was kind of a call a
 
01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
lesser Fallout
 
01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:06.299 align:start position:0%
and so it it just wasn't the focus of
 
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
the bill the focus of the bill was to
 
01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
on just to the chair and I remember
 
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
having this particular argument last
 
01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
time and then 19 of us voted the way it
 
01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:25.849 align:start position:0%
time and then 19 of us voted the way it
went

01:03:25.849 --> 01:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
went
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
on I don't remember any more than that
 
01:03:31.069 --> 01:03:31.079 align:start position:0%
if we have records
 
01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
that we could look at or if somebody
 
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
behind us is going to talk to that that
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
would be helpful
 
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
absolutely we will ask for that
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so much I don't have any more
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
pink cards we do have someone here from
 
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
the dra did anyone want to ask Keen Wong
 
01:03:50.089 --> 01:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
yes um if you just think fill out a pin
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Keane mingual
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
tax policy Council from the Department
 
01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
of Revenue we prepared the fiscal note
 
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
for this bill and the department does
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
not have a position on this Bill I'm
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
here to answer any questions that the
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
committee may have
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative fellows has a question
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
um when I look at this
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
you know I'm new on this committee I
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
don't know very hardly anything about
 
01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
this but it seems to me just logically
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
the reason for having a cap of 80
 
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
percent or some kind of cap has to do
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
with trying to manage your revenue
 
01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
streams because that prevents
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
with the 80 percent uh cap in there it
 
01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.170 align:start position:0%
with the 80 percent uh cap in there it
prevents

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:24.180 align:start position:0%
prevents
 
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
your revenues from taking a really
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
drastic dip in some year that where many
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
of the businesses might be impacted you
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
know covet or you it didn't turn out
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
that way with covid but something could
 
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
happen that would cause that is is that
 
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:45.059 align:start position:0%
the rationale that would be used to have
 
01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:48.380 align:start position:0%
a cap versus no cap
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
about the period just the cap yeah I
 
01:05:53.809 --> 01:05:53.819 align:start position:0%
believe that that could be a reasonable
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
reason for that because as you as you
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
explained it when there's an 80 cap um
 
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
as the previous testimony as well the
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
businesses will not be able to claim the
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
maximum 100 for that particular year uh
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
that remaining um carry the remaining
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
unclaimed NL that does not claim for
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
that particular year will be carried
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
over to the next year for claim if
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
there's taxable income in that for that
 
01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
next year so in that first year the
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
impact on revenues for uh for for the
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
state would not be as stressed yes
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
representative only has a question
 
01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you so given what actually
 
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
happened where the federal government
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
bailed us all out and on
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
business most businesses got back on
 
01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
their feet a lot faster than we were
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
anticipating the did this 80 percent
 
01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
would have artificially increased our
 
01:06:57.539 --> 01:07:01.609 align:start position:0%
would have artificially increased our
revenues

01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:01.619 --> 01:07:03.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:06.299 align:start position:0%
I I wouldn't I'm not because that 80 is
 
01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
for tax years 22 onwards so that impact
 
01:07:13.309 --> 01:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
has not been seen yet though
 
01:07:13.319 --> 01:07:15.950 align:start position:0%
has not been seen yet though
uh

01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
represents Pillsbury
 
01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
would you agree that the effect of the
 
01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
80 percent limit
 
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
is basically to help smooth out the
 
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
cyclicality of uh both the tax burden of
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
the corporate taxpayer as well as the
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
um I believe that it's more of the
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
latter like like what representative
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
fellows was alluding to that it sort of
 
01:07:58.130 --> 01:07:58.140 align:start position:0%
smoothens out the uh the effects on the
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
Rev on the state revenue side but um as
 
01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony mentioned I think
 
01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
uh since the if the on the business side
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
if the taxpayers were able to claim uh
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
the full amount for that first year
 
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
they'll just claim the full amount for
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
the first year so there's probably no
 
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
um I guess
 
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
um and that 80 would stretch it out in
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:27.769 --> 01:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much okay and I just
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
also wanted to point out
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
um during our fiscal note when we
 
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:33.660 align:start position:0%
prepared it uh just wanted to point out
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
that um if this bill was to pass there
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
was some uh language in there that we
 
01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:40.380 align:start position:0%
felt that um
 
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
to apply the uh the 80 uh the removal of
 
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
the 80 limitation to other business
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
organizations other than the C uh other
 
01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
than the C Corp so I think that
 
01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
additional language needed to be
 
01:08:55.309 --> 01:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
included in in the uh in the bill as
 
01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:56.090 align:start position:0%
included in in the uh in the bill as
well

01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
so that all business organizations no
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
matter what form would enjoy that um
 
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
that uh elimination of the the income
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.530 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
taking our question so um
 
01:09:16.729 --> 01:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
you are saying right now the way the
 
01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
bill is written it's not covering all
 
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
businesses uh that is our read on the on
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
the current bill yes it's only for a c
 
01:09:30.169 --> 01:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
corpse right now and then follow up
 
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
that was my fault okay good awesome
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
all right yeah representative Morris
 
01:09:37.849 --> 01:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question so with this change
 
01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:43.259 align:start position:0%
does it impact taxpayers that do not own
 
01:09:43.259 --> 01:09:47.470 align:start position:0%
does it impact taxpayers that do not own
businesses

01:09:47.470 --> 01:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
so right now as it's written it's only
 
01:09:53.209 --> 01:09:53.219 align:start position:0%
for C corpse so um right but I'm saying
 
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
does this shift what I'm asking is does
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
it shift the tax burden in any way
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
it does not shift the text burden no
 
01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
it's okay it's only
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
um so it's so each particular taxpayer
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
would have their liability and it won't
 
01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
shift that burden to another
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayer I'm not sure if I'm
 
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
answering your question no you've
 
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
answered it thank you
 
01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:18.780 align:start position:0%
representative Albi
 
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you but if you're a startup and
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
you registered as a C Corp and you lose
 
01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.050 align:start position:0%
you registered as a C Corp and you lose
300

01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
300
 
01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:29.300 align:start position:0%
000 the first year
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
on and the second year you make the 150
 
01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.490 align:start position:0%
on and the second year you make the 150
and

01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:36.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
Celia's uh
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh example
 
01:10:42.850 --> 01:10:42.860 align:start position:0%
and you have to pay
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand in on thirty thousand in
 
01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.470 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand in on thirty thousand in
taxes

01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
on hasn't that shifted a burden to you
 
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
because you're going to have to borrow
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
that money too if you're still starting
 
01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.570 align:start position:0%
that money too if you're still starting
up

01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
I I guess
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
um in in my mind the shifting of burden
 
01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
is Shifting the tax burden from one
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayer to another taxpayer I think in
 
01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
your example representative there's only
 
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
one taxpayer there's no shifting of
 
01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
Burden from one taxpayer to another
 
01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
taxpayer so I'm just not okay my
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much I see a
 
01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
researcher here were you able to look up
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
the history the legislative recent
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.729 --> 01:11:37.739 align:start position:0%
can we put it on the record would you
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
mind coming up and so we can hear you a
 
01:11:43.490 --> 01:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
the bill that passed last year was SB
 
01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
435 relative to the net operating loss
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
carryover under the business profits tax
 
01:11:52.189 --> 01:11:52.199 align:start position:0%

along with the majority of minority
 
01:12:03.169 --> 01:12:03.179 align:start position:0%
reports that I could produce copies for
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
the whole committee if that would be
 
01:12:04.679 --> 01:12:05.630 align:start position:0%
the whole committee if that would be
helpful

01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you that would be helpful for us
 
01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
to just refresh our memories and what
 
01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.950 align:start position:0%
to just refresh our memories and what
happened

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.570 align:start position:0%
happened
okay

01:12:11.570 --> 01:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.320 align:start position:0%

01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
the former senator
 
01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
committee for the record uh Peter
 
01:12:34.729 --> 01:12:34.739 align:start position:0%
Bragdon recovering state senator uh here
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
representing the greater Nashua Chamber
 
01:12:39.649 --> 01:12:39.659 align:start position:0%
of Commerce of which Mr siglio is is a
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
member and just for some background of
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
the discussion prompted this in me that
 
01:12:45.649 --> 01:12:45.659 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill 435 was an important
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
business Bill last year that dealt with
 
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
a double apportionment issue which I
 
01:12:53.450 --> 01:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
don't fully recollect and understand I
 
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
understood it at the time I do not now
 
01:12:57.530 --> 01:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
but I do recall it was a significant hit
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
to businesses that were basically paying
 
01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
more than they should have to pay so the
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
key thing for all business groups
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
including the Nashua chamber was the
 
01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
double apportionment issue and so when
 
01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
it was discovered at some point in the
 
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
process that by switching to the 2018
 
01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
code it also affects this carry forward
 
01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
that Jim explained
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
um it was kind of like almost like it
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
was too late you know we don't want to
 
01:13:23.209 --> 01:13:23.219 align:start position:0%
stop this train because it's so
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
important to fix the double
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
apportionment problem
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
um and that was part of the reason I
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
think it was just it was so close close
 
01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
to the end so the the underlying bill I
 
01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
think it was Senate Bill 435 was a very
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
important business bill and we all
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
supported it but it seems to have this
 
01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
uh other consequence as well which is
 
01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
being addressed now so I hope that helps
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
provide some context
 
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
so just declare be clear uh does the
 
01:13:48.169 --> 01:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
chamber support this bill as is or would
 
01:13:50.209 --> 01:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
you also recommend that we extend the
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
10-year extend the cap
 
01:13:54.649 --> 01:13:54.659 align:start position:0%
uh the chamber is taking no position on
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
possible changes to it
 
01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
um so definitely supportive of the bill
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
and I think it was pointed out it may
 
01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
only apply to certain companies and
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
obviously would want it to apply to any
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
company so
 
01:14:07.669 --> 01:14:07.679 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
represent uh all me and then ulery
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
it's very helpful you've triggered some
 
01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.030 align:start position:0%
it's very helpful you've triggered some
memory

01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
memory
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:22.940 align:start position:0%
on do you remember some kind of faint uh
 
01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
idea of uh leaving this part of it in
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
would reduce our Revenue hit
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
no my recollection was oh we didn't
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
realize that was included as part of
 
01:14:37.729 --> 01:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and but it's too late
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
to fix it and we don't want to we don't
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
want to derail the train
 
01:14:43.970 --> 01:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
which I I completely understand that it
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
was a very important change that was
 
01:14:45.239 --> 01:14:46.310 align:start position:0%
was a very important change that was
made

01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative ulery
 
01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question Senator the
 
01:14:55.070 --> 01:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
under this bill it would look like a
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
startup business
 
01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
or actually any business that would have
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
a net operating loss
 
01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
would be hit with a tax burden when they
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
were least capable of meeting that tax
 
01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.610 align:start position:0%
were least capable of meeting that tax
burden

01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
burden
 
01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
and yet the Chamber of Commerce
 
01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
is in favor of hurting businesses
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I understand the
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
question uh representative that the
 
01:15:23.209 --> 01:15:23.219 align:start position:0%
chamber supports this bill good thank
 
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
you man
 
01:15:27.050 --> 01:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
well the way this bill looks is that if
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
they have a net operating loss in the
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
first year
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
then they have a net operating loss in
 
01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
the second year as well as they're
 
01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
developing their business or they're
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
recovering from a downturn in business
 
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
cycle for for whatever reason
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
they would still be only able to apply a
 
01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
certain amount of their money up to the
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
cap and then would be held liable for
 
01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
their a tax burden on top of that even
 
01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
though there was no real
 
01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
profitability of the company
 
01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh if I'm reading this uh I do not read
 
01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
it that way I read it as a company will
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
not have to pay uh taxes on profits
 
01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
until such time as they actually make a
 
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
profit cumulatively it's more of a cash
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
flow issue for especially small
 
01:16:17.689 --> 01:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
companies and to be able to uh to have
 
01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
to pay taxes earlier
 
01:16:22.970 --> 01:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
um hurts the small businesses so I I
 
01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
don't agree with your understanding of
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
the bill although I am not an accountant
 
01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh I'm like Mr yoseglio but that's my
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
understanding and that's the chamber's
 
01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.430 align:start position:0%
understanding and that's the chamber's
understanding

01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%

counselor for the Department of Revenue

Administration the department does not
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
have a position on this bill the
 
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:48.780 align:start position:0%

um on that do you want to just give us a
 
01:19:58.729 --> 01:19:58.739 align:start position:0%

sure thank you as we understand this
 
01:20:05.630 --> 01:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
bill is to treat the uh single member
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
LLCs and sole proprietorships as not
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
business organizations and therefore
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
exempting those two types from
 
01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
um BPT as well as bet the department
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
prepared a fiscal note impact on this uh
 
01:20:24.649 --> 01:20:24.659 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
has not performed a detailed analysis on
 
01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:32.219 align:start position:0%
the constitutionality on this this bill
 
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
but uh initial thoughts uh it could be
 
01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional in terms of treating uh
 
01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative ulery
 
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
um just for the education this is the
 
01:20:50.689 --> 01:20:50.699 align:start position:0%
beginning of the the term and there are
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
some individuals could you refresh my
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
memory on the deduction or the filing
 
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
point the threshold of filing for the
 
01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:04.260 align:start position:0%

01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
person LLC
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh for New Hampshire business taxes
 
01:21:11.689 --> 01:21:11.699 align:start position:0%
there is no distinction between uh the
 
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
filing threshold for uh for a single
 
01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:17.100 align:start position:0%

business income and for tax years 23
 
01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
through 24 because of the uh
 
01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
inflation adjustment that's that's done
 
01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:42.900 align:start position:0%

01:21:47.630 --> 01:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and then for business
 
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:52.020 align:start position:0%

the Enterprise Value tax base for tax
 
01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:03.179 align:start position:0%

01:22:06.290 --> 01:22:06.300 align:start position:0%
years from uh 23 through 24 also with
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
the CBI adjustment is 281 thousand
 
01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:09.830 align:start position:0%
the CBI adjustment is 281 thousand
dollars

01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
a little follow-up follow-up all right
 
01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
and that also applies to a sole
 
01:22:18.370 --> 01:22:18.380 align:start position:0%
proprietor yes
 
01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
anyone who's doing business in New
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has that entry threshold that
 
01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
is correct thank you sir I appreciate
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
that you're welcome representative
 
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:31.490 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Wong I asked I sent you a request
 
01:22:36.719 --> 01:22:38.450 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Wong I asked I sent you a request
for

01:22:38.450 --> 01:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
um information on what your what you you
 
01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
did as a fiscal note was solely on the
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
bet I believe uh the fiscal note was
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
done solely on uh 11 10 40 NH 1040
 
01:22:59.630 --> 01:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
filers because the way the
 
01:23:01.850 --> 01:23:01.860 align:start position:0%
the way to file is the business
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
the way uh taxpayers need file their
 
01:23:06.410 --> 01:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
returns their business tax returns in
 
01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if uh it depends on the uh
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
for for single member llc's anyway
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
um so for sole proprietorship sales file
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
a 1040 NH 1040 for for BPT and then uh
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
for uh for their bad returns for smlcs
 
01:23:25.490 --> 01:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
it depends on the member the type of the
 
01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
member so if the single member LLC the
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
single member is a partnership
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
then that smlc will file a NH 1065.
 
01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
there's no checkbox to say okay to
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
identify that this return is a single
 
01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
member LLC filer
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
and then if um then if the member the
 
01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
sole member of the smlc is an individual
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
then the return that's going to be filed
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
will be at NH 1040 and once again
 
01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
there's no check box to indicate on that
 
01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:00.530 align:start position:0%
there's no check box to indicate on that
return

01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
so that's why the fiscal mode is only
 
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
limited to NH 1040s
 
01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
all right follow-up but does that mean
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
that we don't have information on
 
01:24:13.970 --> 01:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
whether these same individuals earned
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
enough profit that they are also paying
 
01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.169 align:start position:0%
enough profit that they are also paying
BPT

01:24:18.169 --> 01:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
BPT
 
01:24:21.649 --> 01:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
for um for the um
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
the question that you asked was um
 
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
earlier in the email was uh for bet
 
01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
filers were they also following BPT and
 
01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:35.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
like 2500 of those bet filers who are
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
sole Proprietors
 
01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
out of the Thirteen thousand
 
01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
yeah so you're now saying I was sorry
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh you're now saying it was 20
 
01:25:01.090 --> 01:25:01.100 align:start position:0%
only 25 people had a BPT liability
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:08.810 --> 01:25:08.820 align:start position:0%
that that isn't
 
01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
clear I think in your response to the
 
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
email which I I've copied to everybody
 
01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:15.910 align:start position:0%

BPT tax due
 
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
only twenty five hundred of that had a
 
01:25:40.810 --> 01:25:40.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%

take a little bit of a break before we
 
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
go into exec session so we can get a
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
little bit organized so why don't we
 
01:26:06.649 --> 01:26:06.659 align:start position:0%

01:38:14.450 --> 01:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 60 and the chair will
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%

01:38:18.770 --> 01:38:18.780 align:start position:0%

yes thank you madam chair
 
01:38:30.290 --> 01:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
I think on this bill we need a little
 
01:38:34.970 --> 01:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
more time there was a
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
the day it was introduced the
 
01:38:42.530 --> 01:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
author mentioned that a constituent was
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
not available so we don't have all that
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
testimony and um and I think there's
 
01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
also we need to just look at how this
 
01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
could affect the state does this affect
 
01:38:58.610 --> 01:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
tourism in some way yes other states do
 
01:39:00.610 --> 01:39:00.620 align:start position:0%
have different fees for different
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
whether someone's out of state but does
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
that mean New Hampshire needs to follow
 
01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
suit is that what we want to do so we
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
need more time to study this
 
01:39:13.729 --> 01:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%

to your motion yes thank you on this
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
bill could be extraordinarily important
 
01:41:44.290 --> 01:41:44.300 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and for
 
01:41:50.649 --> 01:41:50.659 align:start position:0%
for the country uh eventually on but we
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
need the results of what's going to
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
happen in the commission that has been
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
delayed by not being properly staffed
 
01:42:06.169 --> 01:42:06.179 align:start position:0%
yet we need the Staffing to be completed
 
01:42:08.209 --> 01:42:08.219 align:start position:0%
quickly and then to allow that
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
commission to go to work over this
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
summer so that we will be able to tell
 
01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
exactly on what it well
 
01:42:19.970 --> 01:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
we will be able to estimate what it does
 
01:42:22.370 --> 01:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:42:28.189 --> 01:42:28.199 align:start position:0%
our our states on economy and to our
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
state's tax system thank you
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
all the discussion representative Ames
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:36.719 --> 01:42:37.609 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:42:37.609 --> 01:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
you mentioned with respect to their bill
 
01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
we just retained uh Hospital 60 I think
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
that we'd return to retain bills like Ed
 
01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
in the fall I just I understand that but
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
I I suggest in this case it would be
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
well to revisit uh what's happening
 
01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:58.850 align:start position:0%
well to revisit uh what's happening
um

01:42:58.850 --> 01:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
before the summer so that if they're
 
01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
continue to be delays in the work that I
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
think most of us feels feel needs to be
 
01:43:10.330 --> 01:43:10.340 align:start position:0%
done to dig into this complicated issue
 
01:43:13.490 --> 01:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
will at least know that it's not going
 
01:43:16.129 --> 01:43:16.139 align:start position:0%
where it should be going or it is
 
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
um before it gets to be too late
 
01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg and then
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:26.570 --> 01:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
well thank you madam chair
 
01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:27.910 align:start position:0%
well thank you madam chair
um

01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
some of you may find what I'm going to
 
01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
say is confusing as I am part of the
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting Commission
 
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
and Prime sponsor of House Bill 121
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
which I presented to this house Ways and
 
01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
Means Committee on January 17th my
 
01:43:45.649 --> 01:43:45.659 align:start position:0%
position on this bill is counter to what
 
01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
was discussed about retaining House Bill
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
121 to let the commission do its
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
research and hear the Public
 
01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
Presentation by experts on both sides of
 
01:43:55.669 --> 01:43:55.679 align:start position:0%
the issue and listen to the domestic
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
company's views about advantages and
 
01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.810 align:start position:0%
company's views about advantages and
disadvantages

01:43:59.810 --> 01:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
disadvantages
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
this position I'm taking on this bill
 
01:44:03.709 --> 01:44:03.719 align:start position:0%
today is not a reflection on my good
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
friend from Charleston serving as chair
 
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
of this commission who has undertaken
 
01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
trying to populate and move this
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
commission forward
 
01:44:15.229 --> 01:44:15.239 align:start position:0%
even before representative spilsbury was
 
01:44:16.609 --> 01:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
elected chair of the honorable Patrick
 
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
abrami who was elected as the first
 
01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
chair but was unfortunately unseated in
 
01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire as a New Hampshire
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
state representative in the last general
 
01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
election made many efforts to populate
 
01:44:32.890 --> 01:44:32.900 align:start position:0%
this commission per RSA 78-a colon
 
01:44:32.900 --> 01:44:34.810 align:start position:0%
this commission per RSA 78-a colon
23-b

01:44:34.810 --> 01:44:34.820 align:start position:0%
23-b
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%
representative abrami spent two months
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
trying to initiate the formulation of
 
01:44:42.169 --> 01:44:42.179 align:start position:0%
prospects for this commission though it
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
was not his responsibility
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
even though the effective date to report
 
01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
the commission results to the
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
legislature is November 1st 2023 there
 
01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
are still six unpopulated seats to fill
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
on this commission none of these empty
 
01:44:58.430 --> 01:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
commission seats is the responsibility
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
of the new chair of the commission for
 
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:03.300 align:start position:0%
the past six months there has been no
 
01:45:06.109 --> 01:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
movement by those responsible to
 
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
nominate and populate the commission as
 
01:45:10.669 --> 01:45:10.679 align:start position:0%
a member of Ways and Means Committee and
 
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor of this bill I take this
 
01:45:15.050 --> 01:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
position very seriously when it comes to
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
tax policies by just allowing the
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
uncertainty of populating these seats on
 
01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
the commission to drag on I don't want
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
the general public or the New Hampshire
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
business Community to question our
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
motivation as Ways and Means members if
 
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:31.980 align:start position:0%
a tax policy that is presently in place
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
is fair and on a Level Playing Field it
 
01:45:36.649 --> 01:45:36.659 align:start position:0%
has been months since the worldwide
 
01:45:38.570 --> 01:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
combined reporting commission was formed
 
01:45:40.729 --> 01:45:40.739 align:start position:0%
and is still a struggle to motivate
 
01:45:44.330 --> 01:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
parties to populate this commission I
 
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
find myself concerned about the process
 
01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
of determining whether those responsible
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
for populating this commission are
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
serious of investigating this particular
 
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
tax policy
 
01:45:58.370 --> 01:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
from 1986. that is why I feel I must
 
01:46:00.290 --> 01:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
vote against retaining this bill so that
 
01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
an open approach on the concerns raised
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
by the prime sponsor in this bill can be
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
undertaken in a timely fashion thank you
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:46:13.250 --> 01:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey
 
01:46:15.890 --> 01:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Schomburg
 
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
I will defer to um
 
01:46:22.010 --> 01:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
Terry um
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
representative spillsworth
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
action is being taken to populate the
 
01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:29.990 align:start position:0%
action is being taken to populate the
committee

01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure exactly where we are as
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
far as some of the uh other individuals
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
but I am aware that
 
01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
um seats are being filled because I just
 
01:46:43.629 --> 01:46:43.639 align:start position:0%
filled one
 
01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:45.659 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:46:48.709 --> 01:46:48.719 align:start position:0%
spilsbury thank you madam chairman
 
01:46:51.010 --> 01:46:51.020 align:start position:0%
um I understand and sympathize with
 
01:46:54.050 --> 01:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg's frustration
 
01:46:57.169 --> 01:46:57.179 align:start position:0%
uh the good news is that speaker Packard
 
01:46:59.810 --> 01:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
has in fact filled the vacancy in the
 
01:47:02.689 --> 01:47:02.699 align:start position:0%
house with representative ulery who I
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
welcome to the commission
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
and I would just suggest that the
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
primary reason for retaining is not the
 
01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
vacancies or the delay it's simply that
 
01:47:16.729 --> 01:47:16.739 align:start position:0%
the commission was set on a timetable of
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
reporting by November 1st so retaining
 
01:47:21.229 --> 01:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
this bill sinks
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
this committee with the commission's
 
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
ultimate work product
 
01:47:28.370 --> 01:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
and I think that's worth doing
 
01:47:30.350 --> 01:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
and I think we would be doing it even if
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
the commission was fully populated at
 
01:47:34.850 --> 01:47:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet did you have a
 
01:47:39.770 --> 01:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
okay sing oops sorry there you are sorry
 
01:47:45.770 --> 01:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
representative liebly thank you
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
um I just want to uh uh ask a question
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
if I understand there's a deadline in
 
01:47:56.590 --> 01:47:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:59.450 --> 01:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
timeline to which we might we think that
 
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
the commission might start their work
 
01:48:02.570 --> 01:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
because I understand it's a very
 
01:48:03.890 --> 01:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
complicated issue and it might be
 
01:48:05.450 --> 01:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
representative Spielberg could probably
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
answer that question for you
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
sure good question as I had mentioned
 
01:48:13.490 --> 01:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
when I testified on the bill with the
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
work load that the committee has in
 
01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
terms of Revenue estimates and Bill flow
 
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
there is really no point not to mention
 
01:48:25.729 --> 01:48:25.739 align:start position:0%
the vacancies in trying to have the
 
01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
commission meet much before the end of
 
01:48:30.649 --> 01:48:30.659 align:start position:0%
March with crossover coming about April
 
01:48:34.129 --> 01:48:34.139 align:start position:0%
6th so I would look for some progress in
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
terms of our meeting to occur in the
 
01:48:39.290 --> 01:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
April May time frame and then to be very
 
01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:42.659 align:start position:0%
much On Target most commissions
 
01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
are formed with passage of a bill in the
 
01:48:47.689 --> 01:48:47.699 align:start position:0%
spring and a due date of that November
 
01:48:49.850 --> 01:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
it just basically puts us back on that
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
any other comments for discussion okay
 
01:48:58.850 --> 01:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh the motion before us is
 
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
to retain House Bill 121 the clerk will
 
01:49:23.209 --> 01:49:23.219 align:start position:0%

uh this was a law that was passed last
session

03:17:52.190 --> 03:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:17:52.200 --> 03:17:52.849 align:start position:0%
session
um

03:17:52.849 --> 03:17:52.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:52.859 --> 03:17:54.349 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:17:54.349 --> 03:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:17:57.710 --> 03:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
it has been brought to my attention that
 
03:18:00.410 --> 03:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
we're now collect people are not allowed
 
03:18:02.630 --> 03:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
to register their vehicles if they owe
 
03:18:06.349 --> 03:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:06.359 --> 03:18:07.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:18:07.010 --> 03:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:08.750 --> 03:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of problems with this
 
03:18:12.830 --> 03:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
it creates a hardship on those uh folks
 
03:18:15.469 --> 03:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
they have to take time out of work now
 
03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
that they're not allowed to register a
 
03:18:19.370 --> 03:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
vehicle or they didn't even realize that
 
03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
they owe tolls until they went to
 
03:18:22.969 --> 03:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
register the vehicle and now how are you
 
03:18:24.050 --> 03:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
how are they going to get to another
 
03:18:27.050 --> 03:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
state how are they going to get back and
 
03:18:29.030 --> 03:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
forth to work
 
03:18:32.990 --> 03:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
you know we have other states that
 
03:18:34.969 --> 03:18:34.979 align:start position:0%
there's no monetary way and then we're
 
03:18:36.830 --> 03:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
relying on the Postal Service to make
 
03:18:39.710 --> 03:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
sure they get these notifications
 
03:18:42.230 --> 03:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
and just in New Hampshire
 
03:18:44.210 --> 03:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
there are folks when they try and call
 
03:18:47.269 --> 03:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
Easy Pass it's hours on the phone or if
 
03:18:49.910 --> 03:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
they go down to the Easy Pass
 
03:18:52.010 --> 03:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
um place
 
03:18:55.010 --> 03:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
the office it's a you know minimum
 
03:18:58.010 --> 03:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
usually an hour just to get heard
 
03:19:00.290 --> 03:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
if someone's working a regular nine to
 
03:19:02.330 --> 03:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
five job you're talking taking a full
 
03:19:05.269 --> 03:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
day off work losing a day's wages to
 
03:19:07.429 --> 03:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
deal with some of these issues that's
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
just in New Hampshire
 
03:19:10.969 --> 03:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
imagine these people having to go to
 
03:19:13.610 --> 03:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
another state to fix these problems and
 
03:19:15.830 --> 03:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
then once the problem is fixed then they
 
03:19:18.110 --> 03:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
have to go to Concord New Hampshire to
 
03:19:20.450 --> 03:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
get their registration released even if
 
03:19:21.950 --> 03:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
it's already all their tolls have been
 
03:19:21.960 --> 03:19:23.330 align:start position:0%
it's already all their tolls have been
paid

03:19:23.330 --> 03:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
paid
 
03:19:25.130 --> 03:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
okay that is what's happening in New
 
03:19:26.809 --> 03:19:26.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't know how it works in
 
03:19:29.809 --> 03:19:29.819 align:start position:0%
other states but I would say that we are
 
03:19:31.610 --> 03:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
much more efficient here than other the
 
03:19:33.170 --> 03:19:33.180 align:start position:0%
larger States
 
03:19:35.090 --> 03:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
and if we're experiencing that here with
 
03:19:37.670 --> 03:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
our own constituency in this state what
 
03:19:39.230 --> 03:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
do these people what is happening to
 
03:19:40.910 --> 03:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
people in other states
 
03:19:42.769 --> 03:19:42.779 align:start position:0%
we don't collect sales tax for other
 
03:19:45.290 --> 03:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
states we don't do a lot of things but
 
03:19:47.690 --> 03:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
yet we're going to collect tolls and
 
03:19:49.010 --> 03:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to tell people that they
 
03:19:50.750 --> 03:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
can't register their vehicles their only
 
03:19:52.790 --> 03:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
means of transportation to get in back
 
03:19:54.530 --> 03:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
and forth to work
 
03:19:57.889 --> 03:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
transporting their children to school
 
03:20:02.030 --> 03:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
this is just wrong on so many levels
 
03:20:05.690 --> 03:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:05.700 --> 03:20:07.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:20:07.790 --> 03:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:20:09.290 --> 03:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:20:10.969 --> 03:20:10.979 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:20:14.410 --> 03:20:14.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm just trying to think of the
 
03:20:17.150 --> 03:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
potential unintended consequences I mean
 
03:20:19.550 --> 03:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
we do other states
 
03:20:21.710 --> 03:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
help us out whereby what if we can't
 
03:20:24.230 --> 03:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
collect tolls from somebody
 
03:20:24.240 --> 03:20:25.790 align:start position:0%
collect tolls from somebody
um

03:20:25.790 --> 03:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:28.910 --> 03:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that backwards it's we're I
 
03:20:31.730 --> 03:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
mean as soon as we stop doing that we're
 
03:20:33.290 --> 03:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
going to have the same problem from the
 
03:20:34.790 --> 03:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
other states not
 
03:20:36.889 --> 03:20:36.899 align:start position:0%
uh letting us know if
 
03:20:38.510 --> 03:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
people from New Hampshire aren't paying
 
03:20:40.849 --> 03:20:40.859 align:start position:0%
their tolls uh thank you representative
 
03:20:44.090 --> 03:20:44.100 align:start position:0%

03:20:45.830 --> 03:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
would say to you our responsibility is
 
03:20:47.870 --> 03:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
to our citizens of New Hampshire
 
03:20:53.570 --> 03:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:54.950 --> 03:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
other questions from the Committees
 
03:20:57.050 --> 03:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:20:59.570 --> 03:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm trying to get um a better
 
03:21:01.790 --> 03:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
handle on exactly what the problem is
 
03:21:03.830 --> 03:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
like who who are the people that are
 
03:21:07.550 --> 03:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
having this issue are they people
 
03:21:09.590 --> 03:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
who live in New Hampshire
 
03:21:13.610 --> 03:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
that drive their vehicles through the
 
03:21:15.950 --> 03:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
Easy Pass in other states when they
 
03:21:18.849 --> 03:21:18.859 align:start position:0%
don't have a transponder
 
03:21:21.050 --> 03:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative fellows for
 
03:21:23.450 --> 03:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
the question so not everyone has an Easy
 
03:21:25.670 --> 03:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
Pass not everyone in the state has a
 
03:21:27.410 --> 03:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
bank account so they can't have an Easy
 
03:21:27.420 --> 03:21:28.610 align:start position:0%
bank account so they can't have an Easy
Pass

03:21:28.610 --> 03:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
Pass
 
03:21:31.610 --> 03:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
but if you're driving in another state
 
03:21:34.070 --> 03:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's no way for you to pay a toll
 
03:21:35.809 --> 03:21:35.819 align:start position:0%
unless they take a picture of your
 
03:21:35.819 --> 03:21:37.670 align:start position:0%
unless they take a picture of your
vehicle

03:21:37.670 --> 03:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
03:21:39.530 --> 03:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
well then we're relying on the mail to
 
03:21:42.349 --> 03:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
get that to you and if it doesn't get to
 
03:21:44.030 --> 03:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
you in a timely manner then you're
 
03:21:47.510 --> 03:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
tasked with all these excess fees
 
03:21:50.690 --> 03:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
so you're creating a burden on people if
 
03:21:50.700 --> 03:21:51.469 align:start position:0%
so you're creating a burden on people if
someone

03:21:51.469 --> 03:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
someone
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
they take the picture and if someone
 
03:21:55.130 --> 03:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
moved and didn't change get a chance to
 
03:21:57.290 --> 03:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
change your license is that bill gonna
 
03:21:58.790 --> 03:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
ever find how long is it going to take
 
03:22:02.389 --> 03:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:22:06.769 --> 03:22:06.779 align:start position:0%
follow up so so I I could be wrong
 
03:22:08.570 --> 03:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
because I didn't look it up
 
03:22:11.570 --> 03:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
but my recollection because I actually
 
03:22:13.730 --> 03:22:13.740 align:start position:0%
had a constituent that had an issue like
 
03:22:13.740 --> 03:22:15.050 align:start position:0%
had a constituent that had an issue like
this

03:22:15.050 --> 03:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:22:19.010 --> 03:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
um is that if you move you're supposed
 
03:22:21.010 --> 03:22:21.020 align:start position:0%
to notify
 
03:22:25.309 --> 03:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
DMV within I think it's 60 days but it
 
03:22:28.250 --> 03:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
could be only 30. so they would have
 
03:22:31.070 --> 03:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
your new address so you would get that
 
03:22:31.080 --> 03:22:33.050 align:start position:0%
your new address so you would get that
notification

03:22:33.050 --> 03:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
notification
 
03:22:35.090 --> 03:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows for
 
03:22:37.969 --> 03:22:37.979 align:start position:0%
that yes but if that bill is due in 10
 
03:22:40.670 --> 03:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
days now you're you're tasked with
 
03:22:45.469 --> 03:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:46.429 --> 03:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
let's see some other hands that
 
03:22:48.469 --> 03:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
representative all me
 
03:22:51.950 --> 03:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair on it does not
 
03:22:54.230 --> 03:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
seem to me that we're talking about the
 
03:22:56.389 --> 03:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
toll practices of the State of New
 
03:22:58.130 --> 03:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are talking about the toll
 
03:23:01.370 --> 03:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
practices of the States of uh
 
03:23:06.230 --> 03:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Vermont Rhode Island Maybe
 
03:23:09.849 --> 03:23:09.859 align:start position:0%
Florida for all I know probably Florida
 
03:23:13.210 --> 03:23:13.220 align:start position:0%
on and
 
03:23:17.170 --> 03:23:17.180 align:start position:0%
they should be on
 
03:23:20.510 --> 03:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
applying the law in
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
in a way that does not overly burden the
 
03:23:26.809 --> 03:23:26.819 align:start position:0%
person that ran their toll booths
 
03:23:26.819 --> 03:23:28.969 align:start position:0%
person that ran their toll booths
on

03:23:28.969 --> 03:23:28.979 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
and if they are not we can't do much
 
03:23:36.410 --> 03:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
about it except to extinguish the entire
 
03:23:39.769 --> 03:23:39.779 align:start position:0%
network of collaboration
 
03:23:42.710 --> 03:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh isn't it so that's what you're asking
 
03:23:46.670 --> 03:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
for between the states which allows us
 
03:23:50.690 --> 03:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
to stop people from on running our toll
 
03:23:53.990 --> 03:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
booths with impunity which they would be
 
03:23:58.070 --> 03:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
able and know how to do if we pass this
 
03:24:00.170 --> 03:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
bill isn't that so
 
03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the quest question
 
03:24:05.510 --> 03:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative Ami I am not sure I mean
 
03:24:07.969 --> 03:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
I understand that there are people out
 
03:24:07.979 --> 03:24:08.870 align:start position:0%
I understand that there are people out
there

03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:24:11.570 --> 03:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
that willfully break the law every day
 
03:24:13.790 --> 03:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
and that is their intent
 
03:24:15.889 --> 03:24:15.899 align:start position:0%
and if that's their intent they have no
 
03:24:18.050 --> 03:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
intention of paying any tolls whether
 
03:24:19.910 --> 03:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
they have to register a vehicle or not
 
03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking about those people I'm
 
03:24:25.130 --> 03:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
talking about law-abiding citizens that
 
03:24:27.530 --> 03:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
we're putting an undue hardship on that
 
03:24:29.269 --> 03:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
are trying to provide for their families
 
03:24:34.070 --> 03:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
that have no recourse How do they
 
03:24:37.610 --> 03:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
satisfy something if they have a problem
 
03:24:40.670 --> 03:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
in as you said Florida do they have to
 
03:24:42.410 --> 03:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
go to I mean I'm not sure what the
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
recourse is but I know here in New
 
03:24:47.590 --> 03:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is long Waits on the phone
 
03:24:51.050 --> 03:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
and a long wait at the office
 
03:24:54.050 --> 03:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
and not only that is even if you do pay
 
03:24:56.170 --> 03:24:56.180 align:start position:0%
your tolls and you are paid up to date
 
03:24:58.849 --> 03:24:58.859 align:start position:0%
you then do not just have your vehicle
 
03:25:01.370 --> 03:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
registration reinstated you then have to
 
03:25:03.050 --> 03:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
go to Concord DMV
 
03:25:05.510 --> 03:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
and wait in line again
 
03:25:10.370 --> 03:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
so I ask you I think this affects
 
03:25:11.990 --> 03:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
the people
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:19.070 --> 03:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
03:25:20.450 --> 03:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
all right follow up but then we're going
 
03:25:22.250 --> 03:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
to try to get some new other faces okay
 
03:25:23.210 --> 03:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
03:25:25.490 --> 03:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
um brief follow-up done but your doesn't
 
03:25:29.150 --> 03:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
your bill will do the opposite of this
 
03:25:32.110 --> 03:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
it says that we should not
 
03:25:35.929 --> 03:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
comply with requests to block
 
03:25:38.809 --> 03:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
registrations from other states that
 
03:25:39.910 --> 03:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
have been
 
03:25:43.790 --> 03:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
treating the the people that used to
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
live in them or that drove through them
 
03:25:47.040 --> 03:25:49.790 align:start position:0%
live in them or that drove through them
badly

03:25:49.790 --> 03:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:52.010 --> 03:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
represent only I'm having a little bit
 
03:25:53.389 --> 03:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
of hard time could you just repeat that
 
03:25:55.849 --> 03:25:55.859 align:start position:0%
question for me please yes
 
03:25:55.859 --> 03:25:57.110 align:start position:0%
question for me please yes
um

03:25:57.110 --> 03:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:59.389 --> 03:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
what you're asking here
 
03:26:03.590 --> 03:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
is that the commissioner shall not
 
03:26:06.469 --> 03:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
suspend any of the registrations of
 
03:26:09.469 --> 03:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
owners in violation of reciprocal toll
 
03:26:11.870 --> 03:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
collection enforcement agreements that
 
03:26:15.769 --> 03:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
means that you are asking him to not
 
03:26:18.309 --> 03:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
deny the registration
 
03:26:23.150 --> 03:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
on for people who committed violations
 
03:26:27.170 --> 03:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
in other states not in ours that is so
 
03:26:29.330 --> 03:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people who had Pro
 
03:26:32.030 --> 03:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
have problems in other states not in
 
03:26:34.550 --> 03:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
ours that is correct this has nothing to
 
03:26:37.010 --> 03:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
do if you owe tolls to the state of New
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens owing tolls to the
 
03:26:39.769 --> 03:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that is
 
03:26:41.269 --> 03:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct
 
03:26:43.130 --> 03:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:26:45.290 --> 03:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
oh representative Platt yes
 
03:26:46.969 --> 03:26:46.979 align:start position:0%
representative comp toy thank you for
 
03:26:49.070 --> 03:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question if I mispronounce
 
03:26:51.229 --> 03:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
your last name you know it'll get me
 
03:26:53.269 --> 03:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
perfectly you pronounced it perfectly
 
03:26:56.090 --> 03:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
okay thank you what if people don't pay
 
03:26:58.010 --> 03:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
their tolls here
 
03:27:01.010 --> 03:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
do they get notices in the mail do they
 
03:27:03.650 --> 03:27:03.660 align:start position:0%
and do they have to go to clean it up
 
03:27:05.210 --> 03:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
before they get registered here they
 
03:27:06.950 --> 03:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
have to go to Concord
 
03:27:09.830 --> 03:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yes they do
 
03:27:12.710 --> 03:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
they do have to go to not only clean up
 
03:27:15.110 --> 03:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
their tolls here but then they do have
 
03:27:16.670 --> 03:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
to go to Concord to get their vehicle
 
03:27:18.830 --> 03:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
registration reinstated
 
03:27:22.070 --> 03:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
and as I said we're relying on the mail
 
03:27:24.110 --> 03:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure people are getting these
 
03:27:29.150 --> 03:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:31.790 --> 03:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
representative Spielberg has a question
 
03:27:33.349 --> 03:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
I think this follows up very much from
 
03:27:37.910 --> 03:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative plett's question
 
03:27:37.920 --> 03:27:39.410 align:start position:0%
representative plett's question
given

03:27:39.410 --> 03:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
given
 
03:27:42.650 --> 03:27:42.660 align:start position:0%
the arguments you've made which I
 
03:27:44.809 --> 03:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
totally sympathize with
 
03:27:46.969 --> 03:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
uh why are we making a distinction
 
03:27:46.979 --> 03:27:48.590 align:start position:0%
uh why are we making a distinction
between

03:27:48.590 --> 03:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:27:50.690 --> 03:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
those tolls that have been incurred
 
03:27:52.130 --> 03:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
while driving through another state
 
03:27:55.910 --> 03:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
versus those tolls that are not paid at
 
03:27:55.920 --> 03:27:56.710 align:start position:0%
versus those tolls that are not paid at
home

03:27:56.710 --> 03:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
home
 
03:27:59.690 --> 03:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
so I mean just speaking for myself I
 
03:28:02.469 --> 03:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
voted against this bill in the last term
 
03:28:06.469 --> 03:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
but you're only trying to reverse a
 
03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
portion of the problem and how do we
 
03:28:10.849 --> 03:28:10.859 align:start position:0%
make that distinction thank you
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
representative spillsberry my original
 
03:28:16.250 --> 03:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
intent was to reverse it all but I was
 
03:28:17.630 --> 03:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
told that if I did that I would
 
03:28:20.210 --> 03:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
dismantle the Easy Pass system so I
 
03:28:21.590 --> 03:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
figured that probably wouldn't be very
 
03:28:21.600 --> 03:28:23.630 align:start position:0%
figured that probably wouldn't be very
popular

03:28:23.630 --> 03:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
popular
 
03:28:24.530 --> 03:28:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:28:27.110 --> 03:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy has a question
 
03:28:28.429 --> 03:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:28:30.889 --> 03:28:30.899 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm if you could
 
03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
please help me understand your
 
03:28:36.849 --> 03:28:36.859 align:start position:0%
definition of timely manner
 
03:28:41.210 --> 03:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Malloy well
 
03:28:44.090 --> 03:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
if you have a toll
 
03:28:46.849 --> 03:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
say coming from Massachusetts
 
03:28:49.729 --> 03:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
and you know the toll has to be paid
 
03:28:52.969 --> 03:28:52.979 align:start position:0%
within 14 days
 
03:28:54.830 --> 03:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
and you're relying on the mail and you
 
03:28:56.929 --> 03:28:56.939 align:start position:0%
don't pay that toll in 14 days then
 
03:28:59.210 --> 03:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
you're charged late fees
 
03:29:02.809 --> 03:29:02.819 align:start position:0%
and other fees and say you never got
 
03:29:04.250 --> 03:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
that mail because somebody else you
 
03:29:05.929 --> 03:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
didn't even realize that maybe someone
 
03:29:07.370 --> 03:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
borrowed your car and they went through
 
03:29:08.929 --> 03:29:08.939 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts it wasn't even you driving
 
03:29:10.849 --> 03:29:10.859 align:start position:0%
so you just didn't even pay attention to
 
03:29:10.859 --> 03:29:11.870 align:start position:0%
so you just didn't even pay attention to
it

03:29:11.870 --> 03:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:29:13.610 --> 03:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
then you go to register your vehicle in
 
03:29:14.870 --> 03:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire where you
 
03:29:14.880 --> 03:29:15.889 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire where you
live

03:29:15.889 --> 03:29:15.899 align:start position:0%
live
 
03:29:17.630 --> 03:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
where you've been abiding by everything
 
03:29:20.030 --> 03:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
and you find out you can't register your
 
03:29:22.490 --> 03:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
vehicle for an unpaid toll in another
 
03:29:22.500 --> 03:29:27.469 align:start position:0%
vehicle for an unpaid toll in another
state

03:29:27.469 --> 03:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:27.479 --> 03:29:30.889 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:29:30.889 --> 03:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:33.110 --> 03:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
ugh drawing a blank on how to say it a
 
03:29:35.630 --> 03:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
Rochford thank you thank you thank you
 
03:29:37.670 --> 03:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
madam chair and and I thank you
 
03:29:39.229 --> 03:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative I think you may have
 
03:29:41.450 --> 03:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
answered my question
 
03:29:41.460 --> 03:29:42.410 align:start position:0%
answered my question
um

03:29:42.410 --> 03:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:45.469 --> 03:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
going back this really kind of getting a
 
03:29:47.389 --> 03:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
better understanding of reciprocity so
 
03:29:50.210 --> 03:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
the way I'm understanding this is you've
 
03:29:51.590 --> 03:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
got somebody in New Hampshire that
 
03:29:54.349 --> 03:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
breaks a law in Florida
 
03:29:56.150 --> 03:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
but they're being punished in New
 
03:29:57.889 --> 03:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a law being broken in
 
03:29:57.899 --> 03:29:59.870 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a law being broken in
Florida

03:29:59.870 --> 03:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
Florida
 
03:30:03.769 --> 03:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
um so thank you representative for that
 
03:30:05.269 --> 03:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
and yes that is exactly what is
 
03:30:06.889 --> 03:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
happening so if I could follow up on
 
03:30:06.899 --> 03:30:07.969 align:start position:0%
happening so if I could follow up on
that

03:30:07.969 --> 03:30:07.979 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:30:11.690 --> 03:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
so we're speaking about tolls here are
 
03:30:14.570 --> 03:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
there any other examples where New
 
03:30:17.170 --> 03:30:17.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens can be I mean
 
03:30:19.610 --> 03:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
obviously you can
 
03:30:21.710 --> 03:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
you know commit a felony but I'm
 
03:30:24.110 --> 03:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
thinking you go through a stop sign in
 
03:30:25.490 --> 03:30:25.500 align:start position:0%
Florida and they take a picture of your
 
03:30:29.389 --> 03:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
license plate are are those instances
 
03:30:32.510 --> 03:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
do do people in New Hampshire run the
 
03:30:34.490 --> 03:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
risk of losing the ability to register a
 
03:30:37.849 --> 03:30:37.859 align:start position:0%
vehicle in New Hampshire for other types
 
03:30:40.030 --> 03:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
of reciprocity
 
03:30:42.590 --> 03:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
Arrangements uh thank you for the
 
03:30:44.929 --> 03:30:44.939 align:start position:0%
question uh honestly I can't answer that
 
03:30:47.630 --> 03:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
question and the reason this bill was on
 
03:30:50.750 --> 03:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
my radar was when it passed last year of
 
03:30:53.630 --> 03:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
which I also voted against
 
03:30:55.370 --> 03:30:55.380 align:start position:0%
um and I just thought it was egregious
 
03:30:57.410 --> 03:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
that we would do this to our own
 
03:30:57.420 --> 03:31:00.050 align:start position:0%
that we would do this to our own
citizenry

03:31:00.050 --> 03:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
citizenry
 
03:31:02.690 --> 03:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
representative Schoenberg
 
03:31:05.090 --> 03:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I when I was
 
03:31:07.550 --> 03:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the Dre fiscal note is the
 
03:31:09.530 --> 03:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
number correct down there that
 
03:31:12.050 --> 03:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
there were just 88 vehicles
 
03:31:17.710 --> 03:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:19.969 --> 03:31:19.979 align:start position:0%
reciprocity agreement last year or the
 
03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
year before or
 
03:31:25.190 --> 03:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative chamber I'm
 
03:31:27.229 --> 03:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
not sure you know dra has a better
 
03:31:31.849 --> 03:31:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:34.490 --> 03:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
first time questions no more first time
 
03:31:35.929 --> 03:31:35.939 align:start position:0%
representative all me did you want to
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
ask a question again okay could I just
 
03:31:40.550 --> 03:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
make a mention to the chair this is not
 
03:31:43.010 --> 03:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
a dra fiscal note this is a
 
03:31:45.229 --> 03:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
transportation and safety fiscal note
 
03:31:47.389 --> 03:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
because they are the ones who keep that
 
03:31:47.399 --> 03:31:49.190 align:start position:0%
because they are the ones who keep that
data

03:31:49.190 --> 03:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
data
 
03:31:50.750 --> 03:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
and just so you know we have a
 
03:31:51.769 --> 03:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
representative from the New Hampshire
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
dot who will be speaking to us that
 
03:31:55.969 --> 03:31:55.979 align:start position:0%
maybe can answer some questions and
 
03:31:57.469 --> 03:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
hands up on this side yes representative
 
03:31:57.479 --> 03:31:58.729 align:start position:0%
hands up on this side yes representative
spilsbury

03:31:58.729 --> 03:31:58.739 align:start position:0%
spilsbury
 
03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
so a different angle on the reciprocity
 
03:32:02.399 --> 03:32:03.830 align:start position:0%
so a different angle on the reciprocity
um

03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:06.530 --> 03:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
what does New Hampshire do when a
 
03:32:08.750 --> 03:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
Florida resident driving a car with
 
03:32:11.330 --> 03:32:11.340 align:start position:0%
Florida plates goes through a toll and
 
03:32:13.570 --> 03:32:13.580 align:start position:0%
doesn't pay in New Hampshire
 
03:32:16.309 --> 03:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
ripens feels very honestly I do not know
 
03:32:18.290 --> 03:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
I wasn't looking into what happens to a
 
03:32:19.910 --> 03:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
Florida resident I'm only concerned with
 
03:32:27.969 --> 03:32:27.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:30.050 --> 03:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
03:32:32.690 --> 03:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:32:34.969 --> 03:32:34.979 align:start position:0%
okay well now represent recognize
 
03:32:44.269 --> 03:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:47.150 --> 03:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon representatives for the
 
03:32:49.010 --> 03:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
record representative Hull serving the
 
03:32:50.870 --> 03:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
towns of Dunbarton hooks at Allenstown
 
03:32:52.309 --> 03:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
and epsom
 
03:32:55.130 --> 03:32:55.140 align:start position:0%
here before you to support House Bill
 
03:32:55.140 --> 03:32:57.889 align:start position:0%
here before you to support House Bill
486

03:32:57.889 --> 03:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
486
 
03:33:00.050 --> 03:33:00.060 align:start position:0%
and I guess
 
03:33:02.809 --> 03:33:02.819 align:start position:0%
although there's there's context
 
03:33:07.670 --> 03:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
relative to 260 RSA 263 56-f
 
03:33:09.110 --> 03:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
I think it makes sense to have a little
 
03:33:10.670 --> 03:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
bit of an understanding of what happens
 
03:33:12.530 --> 03:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
when your vehicle registration
 
03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
privileges have been suspended and
 
03:33:18.769 --> 03:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
in part two the it goes on the director
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
shall pursue into RSA 541 right create
 
03:33:24.650 --> 03:33:24.660 align:start position:0%
rules regarding reinstatement privileges
 
03:33:27.530 --> 03:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
250 dollars is the first fine
 
03:33:29.809 --> 03:33:29.819 align:start position:0%
it goes up for a second offense at 500
 
03:33:31.250 --> 03:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
and then a thousand dollars for a third
 
03:33:32.870 --> 03:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
and subsequent offenses
 
03:33:35.050 --> 03:33:35.060 align:start position:0%
so what we're talking about is
 
03:33:37.790 --> 03:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
potentially denying someone the ability
 
03:33:39.530 --> 03:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
to register a car
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
and then New Hampshire enforcing a
 
03:33:45.469 --> 03:33:45.479 align:start position:0%
penalty at 250 dollars from potentially
 
03:33:48.170 --> 03:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
something as simple as a mist or failure
 
03:33:50.929 --> 03:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
to read of an Easy Pass going down while
 
03:33:53.630 --> 03:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
you're visiting some other state
 
03:33:56.809 --> 03:33:56.819 align:start position:0%
our constitution is pretty clear under
 
03:33:59.389 --> 03:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
part first article 18 penalties to be
 
03:34:02.330 --> 03:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
proportional to the offenses
 
03:34:05.030 --> 03:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure a we should be the toll
 
03:34:06.650 --> 03:34:06.660 align:start position:0%
collection agency for the rest of the
 
03:34:09.050 --> 03:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
country but more importantly if we are
 
03:34:11.030 --> 03:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
the penalty section should be more in
 
03:34:13.070 --> 03:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
line with the offense
 
03:34:16.130 --> 03:34:16.140 align:start position:0%
than they are today and I think that's
 
03:34:18.410 --> 03:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
the root cause here is we're suspending
 
03:34:21.170 --> 03:34:21.180 align:start position:0%
the the registration privileges
 
03:34:23.090 --> 03:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
potentially denying someone the ability
 
03:34:25.429 --> 03:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
to get to work I would consider that an
 
03:34:27.469 --> 03:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
overly harsh penalty
 
03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
for something as simple as a missed fine
 
03:34:33.410 --> 03:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
here's a good example you're coming home
 
03:34:35.630 --> 03:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
um from Maine over the weekend your
 
03:34:37.250 --> 03:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
transponder seems to be working fine and
 
03:34:38.990 --> 03:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
you miss the tolls sorry you missed the
 
03:34:41.330 --> 03:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
exit to get on 101 headed west and lo
 
03:34:42.830 --> 03:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
and behold you're now into headed into
 
03:34:42.840 --> 03:34:45.170 align:start position:0%
and behold you're now into headed into
Massachusetts

03:34:45.170 --> 03:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
03:34:46.849 --> 03:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
um and you end up racking up a couple
 
03:34:48.530 --> 03:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
other tolls but one of those doesn't
 
03:34:50.630 --> 03:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
read you don't realize it doesn't read
 
03:34:53.570 --> 03:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
your battery on your 14 year old guilty
 
03:34:53.580 --> 03:34:55.130 align:start position:0%
your battery on your 14 year old guilty
transponder

03:34:55.130 --> 03:34:55.140 align:start position:0%
transponder
 
03:34:58.190 --> 03:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
um has finally died and although it
 
03:34:59.750 --> 03:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
didn't happen in Massachusetts it did
 
03:35:02.690 --> 03:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
happen in New Hampshire a few times
 
03:35:02.700 --> 03:35:04.070 align:start position:0%
happen in New Hampshire a few times
um

03:35:04.070 --> 03:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:07.010 --> 03:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
they fail to notify you
 
03:35:08.090 --> 03:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if any of you are
 
03:35:10.309 --> 03:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
getting house calendars late my last one
 
03:35:13.250 --> 03:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
was five days after it was sent out I
 
03:35:15.429 --> 03:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
only live 11 miles from here okay
 
03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
relying on the United States Postal
 
03:35:19.849 --> 03:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
System to deliver mail in a timely
 
03:35:22.670 --> 03:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
manner is not a given although it is a
 
03:35:24.410 --> 03:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement it is not a
 
03:35:28.370 --> 03:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
given thing that we can trust in 2023
 
03:35:32.090 --> 03:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
so I would ask that you see that their
 
03:35:34.190 --> 03:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
true cost right yes there's a revenue
 
03:35:35.870 --> 03:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
impact to this bill that's why it's here
 
03:35:38.090 --> 03:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
and not in transportation but more
 
03:35:38.100 --> 03:35:39.349 align:start position:0%
and not in transportation but more
importantly

03:35:39.349 --> 03:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
importantly
 
03:35:41.750 --> 03:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
this is about proportional penalties
 
03:35:43.849 --> 03:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
relative to the offense and I think the
 
03:35:45.769 --> 03:35:45.779 align:start position:0%
proportional penalties right right now
 
03:35:47.929 --> 03:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
of denying someone the ability to
 
03:35:49.370 --> 03:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
register a car
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
and then forcing them to spend 250
 
03:35:53.410 --> 03:35:53.420 align:start position:0%
dollars to get their registration back
 
03:35:57.769 --> 03:35:57.779 align:start position:0%
is way out of line relative to someone
 
03:36:01.309 --> 03:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
failing to make right to pay a fine
 
03:36:03.469 --> 03:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
let's say it's malicious I'll go to the
 
03:36:05.870 --> 03:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
corner case that they maliciously they
 
03:36:09.410 --> 03:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
knowingly drove to DC and back and chose
 
03:36:11.150 --> 03:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
not to leave their transponder in their
 
03:36:13.190 --> 03:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
window and they racked up thirty dollars
 
03:36:15.530 --> 03:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
worth of charges both ways for all the
 
03:36:18.610 --> 03:36:18.620 align:start position:0%
tolls and they tell everybody from
 
03:36:20.809 --> 03:36:20.819 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts all the way down we're
 
03:36:22.490 --> 03:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
just not going to pay it
 
03:36:25.130 --> 03:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
I don't even think in that case for the
 
03:36:27.590 --> 03:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
sixty dollars of failed tolls our
 
03:36:30.290 --> 03:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
current punishment makes sense
 
03:36:32.150 --> 03:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
I think there needs to be a better way
 
03:36:34.070 --> 03:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do reciprocity between
 
03:36:35.990 --> 03:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
states that's fine
 
03:36:37.550 --> 03:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that we should be the
 
03:36:38.929 --> 03:36:38.939 align:start position:0%
business in the business of collecting
 
03:36:40.429 --> 03:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
tolls for the rest of the country nor
 
03:36:41.690 --> 03:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
should they be in the business of
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
collecting our tolls I think
 
03:36:45.710 --> 03:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
fundamentally we've created a problem by
 
03:36:47.510 --> 03:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
this interstate agreement I would ask
 
03:36:50.269 --> 03:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
that you would support this bill to stop
 
03:36:51.950 --> 03:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
this thank you
 
03:36:54.170 --> 03:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
would you be open to questions sure do
 
03:36:56.929 --> 03:36:56.939 align:start position:0%
my best other questions over here
 
03:36:56.939 --> 03:37:01.849 align:start position:0%
my best other questions over here
representatively

03:37:01.849 --> 03:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:05.570 --> 03:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:07.550 --> 03:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you could just help me
 
03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
understand your testimony I'm looking at
 
03:37:14.929 --> 03:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:14.939 --> 03:37:17.090 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:37:17.090 --> 03:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:19.670 --> 03:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
so it says the director shall notify the
 
03:37:22.429 --> 03:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
owner in writing by first class mail
 
03:37:24.050 --> 03:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
that the owner's Motor Vehicle
 
03:37:26.690 --> 03:37:26.700 align:start position:0%
Registration privileges for the vehicle
 
03:37:30.469 --> 03:37:30.479 align:start position:0%
driven in violation of RSA 23631 are
 
03:37:33.050 --> 03:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
suspended as of the date which is 30
 
03:37:35.929 --> 03:37:35.939 align:start position:0%
days from the date of notification
 
03:37:38.330 --> 03:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
and less the toll in any administrative
 
03:37:39.950 --> 03:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
fees assessed by the Department of
 
03:37:42.290 --> 03:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
Transportation are paid So currently
 
03:37:46.670 --> 03:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
that fee is 250 no
 
03:37:50.870 --> 03:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
so that fee kicks in after the
 
03:37:53.330 --> 03:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
registration has been suspended
 
03:37:53.340 --> 03:37:57.290 align:start position:0%
registration has been suspended
so

03:37:57.290 --> 03:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:00.590 --> 03:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
if header they have failed to pay a toll
 
03:38:03.830 --> 03:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
and they respond by paying the toll and
 
03:38:06.590 --> 03:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
any administrative fees then they're all
 
03:38:08.210 --> 03:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
set they don't lose their registration
 
03:38:13.309 --> 03:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
so it correct if the if if that was the
 
03:38:14.990 --> 03:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
important element in that sentence if
 
03:38:17.929 --> 03:38:17.939 align:start position:0%
they received a notification
 
03:38:20.870 --> 03:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
given that we're still relying on the
 
03:38:22.429 --> 03:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
United States Postal System to deliver
 
03:38:24.650 --> 03:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
some of this because that is the system
 
03:38:27.530 --> 03:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
of record right now and there is not
 
03:38:29.210 --> 03:38:29.220 align:start position:0%
certain it's not like it's a registered
 
03:38:30.410 --> 03:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
mail or something that's going to be
 
03:38:32.750 --> 03:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
traceable this is typically sent through
 
03:38:36.469 --> 03:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
first class mail by another state to us
 
03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
it may or may not get to the right
 
03:38:40.849 --> 03:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
address they may or may have may or may
 
03:38:43.130 --> 03:38:43.140 align:start position:0%
not have an accurate record in their
 
03:38:45.769 --> 03:38:45.779 align:start position:0%
database right Easy Pass may have
 
03:38:47.929 --> 03:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
outdated information there's I could
 
03:38:49.790 --> 03:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
think of a lot of reasons why that that
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
particular letter does not arrive at the
 
03:38:54.650 --> 03:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
individual so now not only have they
 
03:38:56.389 --> 03:38:56.399 align:start position:0%
missed the first letter notifying them
 
03:38:58.370 --> 03:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
that they missed a toll then they get a
 
03:39:00.050 --> 03:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
second letter that says you've missed a
 
03:39:02.210 --> 03:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
toll and you've been assessed this
 
03:39:03.950 --> 03:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
additional fine and penalty for failing
 
03:39:05.990 --> 03:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
to pay the first time
 
03:39:09.050 --> 03:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
it now kicks it back to New Hampshire so
 
03:39:11.090 --> 03:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
failure to communicate shouldn't be a
 
03:39:14.830 --> 03:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
punishment at the 250 level if it was
 
03:39:18.650 --> 03:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
something like the they were they were
 
03:39:21.290 --> 03:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
it was a a registered lever letter where
 
03:39:23.330 --> 03:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
there was right they had to sign the
 
03:39:24.889 --> 03:39:24.899 align:start position:0%
letter to acknowledge receipt then we
 
03:39:26.570 --> 03:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
started the Rules start to change at
 
03:39:27.889 --> 03:39:27.899 align:start position:0%
least the person is aware of what's
 
03:39:34.929 --> 03:39:34.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:37.070 --> 03:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative rodford
 
03:39:40.010 --> 03:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:39:41.690 --> 03:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get if you could help me
 
03:39:44.150 --> 03:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
with this so what I'm understanding is
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't pay a toll in Mass a
 
03:39:49.550 --> 03:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
dollar 75 toll in Massachusetts right
 
03:39:51.229 --> 03:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
blow it off intentionally or
 
03:39:51.239 --> 03:39:53.389 align:start position:0%
blow it off intentionally or
unintentionally

03:39:53.389 --> 03:39:53.399 align:start position:0%
unintentionally
 
03:39:56.690 --> 03:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
so that reciprocity means they can't
 
03:39:58.969 --> 03:39:58.979 align:start position:0%
register a car in New Hampshire so that
 
03:40:01.010 --> 03:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
takes away their ability to register in
 
03:40:02.389 --> 03:40:02.399 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire misses out on
 
03:40:04.610 --> 03:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
revenue from car registrations yeah
 
03:40:07.250 --> 03:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
right so would you agree with me that
 
03:40:09.349 --> 03:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
we're actually the state enhancer is the
 
03:40:11.210 --> 03:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
bigger biggest loser in this
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
So based on the possibly right based on
 
03:40:16.969 --> 03:40:16.979 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that's in the bill it
 
03:40:18.710 --> 03:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
looks like we might not collect thirty
 
03:40:21.050 --> 03:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars assuming that the
 
03:40:23.570 --> 03:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
dot captured their information correctly
 
03:40:25.190 --> 03:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm reading the fiscal note right we
 
03:40:27.410 --> 03:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
may be a lot of loss where other states
 
03:40:30.590 --> 03:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
are helping us Force collections but at
 
03:40:32.570 --> 03:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
the end of the day
 
03:40:35.210 --> 03:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
um it might affect a car registration it
 
03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
might affect someone's ability to drive
 
03:40:38.690 --> 03:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
a car and we have an obligation to make
 
03:40:41.030 --> 03:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
sure our punishments that we hand out
 
03:40:43.370 --> 03:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
here within the state are somewhat
 
03:40:46.550 --> 03:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
compliant with the Constitution and this
 
03:40:49.010 --> 03:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
is definitely not proportional to the
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
dollar 75 toll where you're you're
 
03:40:53.870 --> 03:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
revoking someone's ability to
 
03:40:55.729 --> 03:40:55.739 align:start position:0%
potentially drive to work the next day
 
03:40:58.370 --> 03:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
that could be problematic and it kicks
 
03:41:00.170 --> 03:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
off another series of events right once
 
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
you've gone down this path
 
03:41:04.729 --> 03:41:04.739 align:start position:0%
now you don't have a registered car and
 
03:41:06.650 --> 03:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
you get pulled over for a police by a
 
03:41:08.389 --> 03:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
police officer now you're driving an
 
03:41:10.010 --> 03:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
unregistered vehicle so this just
 
03:41:13.370 --> 03:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
snowballs into a series of problems over
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
a toll that is was supposed to be
 
03:41:17.870 --> 03:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
collected in another state
 
03:41:19.490 --> 03:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
we're not in the business of doing the
 
03:41:21.170 --> 03:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
work for the other states as far as I
 
03:41:23.090 --> 03:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
know we don't really get paid to do the
 
03:41:24.590 --> 03:41:24.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement for work for the other
 
03:41:24.600 --> 03:41:25.610 align:start position:0%
enforcement for work for the other
states

03:41:25.610 --> 03:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:41:27.469 --> 03:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
I understand the desire to have a
 
03:41:29.030 --> 03:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
reciprocal agreement between States
 
03:41:30.410 --> 03:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
because it makes it a little bit more
 
03:41:32.750 --> 03:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
convenient but convenience is not why
 
03:41:34.969 --> 03:41:34.979 align:start position:0%
we're here we should in fact be
 
03:41:37.490 --> 03:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
enforcing our laws on our citizens and
 
03:41:39.530 --> 03:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
not trying to enforce the loss of other
 
03:41:44.170 --> 03:41:44.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:48.650 --> 03:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:51.889 --> 03:41:51.899 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm here
 
03:41:51.899 --> 03:41:53.389 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm here
um

03:41:53.389 --> 03:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:55.309 --> 03:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you mentioned uh an
 
03:41:58.610 --> 03:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
interstate agreement and uh I don't know
 
03:42:01.729 --> 03:42:01.739 align:start position:0%
whether you meant by that that there is
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
such a thing but if there is
 
03:42:05.870 --> 03:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
um maybe you could tell us about about
 
03:42:09.950 --> 03:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
it and uh then sort of related to that
 
03:42:13.010 --> 03:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
question is what you know about what
 
03:42:15.349 --> 03:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
other states have
 
03:42:17.690 --> 03:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
put into their laws in terms of
 
03:42:19.910 --> 03:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement that might be parallel
 
03:42:22.250 --> 03:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
consistent way they're inconsistent with
 
03:42:24.889 --> 03:42:24.899 align:start position:0%
what's in this bill and I will say that
 
03:42:28.450 --> 03:42:28.460 align:start position:0%
you would make a a good point about the
 
03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
disproportionality of the punishment
 
03:42:33.110 --> 03:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's in here
 
03:42:35.389 --> 03:42:35.399 align:start position:0%
um whether it's unconstitutional or not
 
03:42:37.849 --> 03:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
that's a different question but uh yeah
 
03:42:41.570 --> 03:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
right so by no means an expert on the
 
03:42:43.610 --> 03:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
toll collection systems for the other 49
 
03:42:43.620 --> 03:42:46.370 align:start position:0%
toll collection systems for the other 49
states

03:42:46.370 --> 03:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:47.690 --> 03:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know that I could
 
03:42:49.130 --> 03:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
effectively answer
 
03:42:52.010 --> 03:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
or speak to that part of the question
 
03:42:55.610 --> 03:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
I do think right we as a legislature
 
03:42:57.349 --> 03:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
should be crafting laws about how we
 
03:42:59.750 --> 03:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
enforce our laws on our right relative
 
03:43:02.630 --> 03:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
to our citizens and if someone from
 
03:43:04.370 --> 03:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
Maine drives through New Hampshire to
 
03:43:06.650 --> 03:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and fails to pay our tolls
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
right we may have our only recourse may
 
03:43:11.330 --> 03:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
be the next time they're on the roads
 
03:43:14.210 --> 03:43:14.220 align:start position:0%
and an officer spots them and realizes
 
03:43:16.550 --> 03:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
that plate hasn't been
 
03:43:20.929 --> 03:43:20.939 align:start position:0%
is owing it owes money that right when
 
03:43:22.130 --> 03:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
they pull them over right they were
 
03:43:23.389 --> 03:43:23.399 align:start position:0%
speeding they pull them over and say oh
 
03:43:25.429 --> 03:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
you're owing money now now that's now
 
03:43:27.290 --> 03:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
it's time to collect that fee that might
 
03:43:29.929 --> 03:43:29.939 align:start position:0%
be the only recourse available it's very
 
03:43:31.849 --> 03:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
difficult to enforce our laws on State
 
03:43:33.889 --> 03:43:33.899 align:start position:0%
on residents who spend a very limited
 
03:43:35.570 --> 03:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
amount of time traveling through the
 
03:43:35.580 --> 03:43:38.690 align:start position:0%
amount of time traveling through the
state

03:43:38.690 --> 03:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:40.849 --> 03:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
you're okay with more questions sure
 
03:43:42.650 --> 03:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
okay representative Platt has a question
 
03:43:46.790 --> 03:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
yes what is the cost to the DMV
 
03:43:49.550 --> 03:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
to suspend registration
 
03:43:52.610 --> 03:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
and then to re uh activate the
 
03:43:55.190 --> 03:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
registration is is that anywhere near
 
03:43:58.370 --> 03:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
250 do you know uh I do not that's a
 
03:44:00.229 --> 03:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
great question I I would ask that you
 
03:44:02.030 --> 03:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
would ask the person who signed up from
 
03:44:03.950 --> 03:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
the dot to speak that's supposed to
 
03:44:05.330 --> 03:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
speak after me that same question
 
03:44:07.969 --> 03:44:07.979 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what the cost is it
 
03:44:09.710 --> 03:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
does seem like that's a that's a fairly
 
03:44:12.170 --> 03:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
Hefty fine relative to what we're
 
03:44:13.729 --> 03:44:13.739 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative elberger has a question
 
03:44:19.130 --> 03:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:44:22.729 --> 03:44:22.739 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious about who sets the fees
 
03:44:24.290 --> 03:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
for penalties
 
03:44:27.410 --> 03:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
and why we're not talking to them about
 
03:44:31.550 --> 03:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:31.560 --> 03:44:33.050 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:44:33.050 --> 03:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:39.229 --> 03:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
in RSA 263 56 Dash F right we set the
 
03:44:41.929 --> 03:44:41.939 align:start position:0%
penalties for a suspended registration
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
in Roman numeral two sections one two
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
and three relative to the late payments
 
03:44:50.090 --> 03:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
and the penalties that I'd have to dig
 
03:44:54.050 --> 03:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
into I'm sure we probably established a
 
03:44:56.269 --> 03:44:56.279 align:start position:0%
maximum penalty somewhere in statute or
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
gave authority via rules to the
 
03:45:01.490 --> 03:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
department to be able to do this for
 
03:45:03.889 --> 03:45:03.899 align:start position:0%
assigning penalties for late payment
 
03:45:06.410 --> 03:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
and I don't know what the current one is
 
03:45:09.469 --> 03:45:09.479 align:start position:0%
um I I had a similar experience when I
 
03:45:11.929 --> 03:45:11.939 align:start position:0%
had to deal with a transponder that was
 
03:45:13.610 --> 03:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
14 years old I was one of the early
 
03:45:16.070 --> 03:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
adopters and it recently died about last
 
03:45:18.429 --> 03:45:18.439 align:start position:0%
last year the year before and there was
 
03:45:22.130 --> 03:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
something like 30 charges that had
 
03:45:24.110 --> 03:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
racked up in a month because the
 
03:45:26.030 --> 03:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
responder wasn't working and I drove up
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
to Concord and spent a fair amount of
 
03:45:29.090 --> 03:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
time and straightened it all out
 
03:45:31.610 --> 03:45:31.620 align:start position:0%
there was some penalty associated with
 
03:45:35.150 --> 03:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
it because their data was old and they
 
03:45:36.530 --> 03:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
said you know we should just give you
 
03:45:38.630 --> 03:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
new transponders for all your cars
 
03:45:39.830 --> 03:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
because you're bound to have this
 
03:45:42.110 --> 03:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
problem on your other vehicles in a
 
03:45:44.210 --> 03:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
relatively short period of time so I
 
03:45:45.889 --> 03:45:45.899 align:start position:0%
ended up getting four new transponders
 
03:45:47.210 --> 03:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
for our family
 
03:45:50.269 --> 03:45:50.279 align:start position:0%
I I don't know who sets it but typically
 
03:45:53.030 --> 03:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
in statute there is a we the legislature
 
03:45:55.010 --> 03:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
sets a maximum I just think that the
 
03:45:57.290 --> 03:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
maximum for this particular section is
 
03:45:59.150 --> 03:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
wrong and I don't think we should be
 
03:46:02.530 --> 03:46:02.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:05.090 --> 03:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
are we okay representative Olney has a
 
03:46:05.100 --> 03:46:06.710 align:start position:0%
are we okay representative Olney has a
question

03:46:06.710 --> 03:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:46:09.650 --> 03:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you on
 
03:46:12.769 --> 03:46:12.779 align:start position:0%
if we passed this
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
we would be relieving
 
03:46:18.050 --> 03:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
our citizens of
 
03:46:24.229 --> 03:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
on paying penalties on their violations
 
03:46:27.349 --> 03:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
in other states but not within our own
 
03:46:27.359 --> 03:46:28.490 align:start position:0%
in other states but not within our own
state

03:46:28.490 --> 03:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
which you've been using as an example of
 
03:46:35.690 --> 03:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
unreasonableness on
 
03:46:39.410 --> 03:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
why would we want to do that just to
 
03:46:42.889 --> 03:46:42.899 align:start position:0%
leave it to the other state ones so
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
let's start with not being the law
 
03:46:47.870 --> 03:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency for the other 49
 
03:46:50.750 --> 03:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
states and then while this bill is in
 
03:46:52.670 --> 03:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
this committee maybe the right thing to
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
do after you speak to the member
 
03:46:57.889 --> 03:46:57.899 align:start position:0%
speaking after me is readjust the
 
03:46:59.570 --> 03:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
penalties so they're more in line with
 
03:47:00.889 --> 03:47:00.899 align:start position:0%
something that would be reasonable
 
03:47:03.290 --> 03:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
because I could make a convincing
 
03:47:05.150 --> 03:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
argument that we should truncate the
 
03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
last zero for all the current penalties
 
03:47:10.190 --> 03:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
from 25.50 to 100.
 
03:47:13.190 --> 03:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
um versus the current 250 500 and a
 
03:47:14.990 --> 03:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
thousand and it would be more in line
 
03:47:18.229 --> 03:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
with failure to make payment on a dollar
 
03:47:22.610 --> 03:47:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:24.950 --> 03:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative orrs has a question
 
03:47:26.750 --> 03:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam Karen thanks for taking
 
03:47:29.809 --> 03:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
my question so what a possible fix be to
 
03:47:32.389 --> 03:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
amend this bill so that we not only
 
03:47:34.130 --> 03:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
reduce the fees that you've just
 
03:47:36.590 --> 03:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned but also the start the clock
 
03:47:38.690 --> 03:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
when they've signed off on a registered
 
03:47:41.330 --> 03:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
letter notifying them that they have a
 
03:47:44.570 --> 03:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
deficiency I I I think that would be a
 
03:47:46.309 --> 03:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
great solution to some of the problems
 
03:47:49.250 --> 03:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing because failure to
 
03:47:51.410 --> 03:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
notify creates this

03:48:15.469 --> 03:48:15.479 align:start position:0%
days to get to my house
 
03:48:18.590 --> 03:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's a problem and uh recently I've
 
03:48:20.330 --> 03:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
gone through the toe boost before I got
 
03:48:23.269 --> 03:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
my little orange transponder and I got a
 
03:48:25.309 --> 03:48:25.319 align:start position:0%

work so yeah we do have some issues
 
03:48:31.200 --> 03:48:33.229 align:start position:0%
work so yeah we do have some issues
there

03:48:33.229 --> 03:48:33.239 align:start position:0%

03:49:01.370 --> 03:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and members
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
03:49:04.969 --> 03:49:04.979 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system operates as an
 
03:49:06.889 --> 03:49:06.899 align:start position:0%
Enterprise fund when all the revenue
 
03:49:08.990 --> 03:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
collected in the system must be used on
 
03:49:10.130 --> 03:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
a system
 
03:49:13.070 --> 03:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
the revenue is collected to pay for our
 
03:49:14.809 --> 03:49:14.819 align:start position:0%
operation and maintenance our debt
 
03:49:16.670 --> 03:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
service our renewal and replacement
 
03:49:18.769 --> 03:49:18.779 align:start position:0%
program and our Capital program which
 
03:49:21.290 --> 03:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
follows the state's 10-year program
 
03:49:23.510 --> 03:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
all revenue on the system is put back
 
03:49:25.790 --> 03:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
into the system reduction in Revenue
 
03:49:27.830 --> 03:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
ends up creating delays in our Capital
 
03:49:27.840 --> 03:49:30.349 align:start position:0%
ends up creating delays in our Capital
program

03:49:30.349 --> 03:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:49:32.870 --> 03:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
as you've heard we we operate on the
 
03:49:35.330 --> 03:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
Easy Pass system the Easy Pass system
 
03:49:38.389 --> 03:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
consists of 35 toll agencies through 19
 
03:49:38.399 --> 03:49:39.710 align:start position:0%
consists of 35 toll agencies through 19
States

03:49:39.710 --> 03:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
States
 
03:49:43.130 --> 03:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
this provides a seamless efficient
 
03:49:45.650 --> 03:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
effective way to collect tolls for
 
03:49:48.410 --> 03:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
in-state and out-of-state
 
03:49:48.420 --> 03:49:50.389 align:start position:0%
in-state and out-of-state
residents

03:49:50.389 --> 03:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
residents
 
03:49:52.969 --> 03:49:52.979 align:start position:0%
the users on the system are supposed to
 
03:49:55.610 --> 03:49:55.620 align:start position:0%
pay the toll at the time as the time
 
03:49:57.229 --> 03:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
they pass through the toll there are a
 
03:49:59.150 --> 03:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
variety of options they can pay the toll
 
03:50:01.070 --> 03:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
when they are fail the paid at all
 
03:50:03.050 --> 03:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
incurs enough significant number of
 
03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
violations they are faced with
 
03:50:06.650 --> 03:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
suspension of their registration
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
this is the total enforcement
 
03:50:11.870 --> 03:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
method of in place and it is infected
 
03:50:11.880 --> 03:50:13.309 align:start position:0%
method of in place and it is infected
effective

03:50:13.309 --> 03:50:13.319 align:start position:0%
effective
 
03:50:15.769 --> 03:50:15.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents are faced the
 
03:50:18.050 --> 03:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
constant consequences of suspension of
 
03:50:19.490 --> 03:50:19.500 align:start position:0%
the vehicle registration
 
03:50:22.070 --> 03:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
for failure to pay tolls and mass in
 
03:50:25.309 --> 03:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
Maine are also are faced with the
 
03:50:27.710 --> 03:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle suspension for fail to pay New
 
03:50:29.150 --> 03:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tolls
 
03:50:31.130 --> 03:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
we were able to collect
 
03:50:33.290 --> 03:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
from the mass and Main violators because
 
03:50:35.389 --> 03:50:35.399 align:start position:0%
of this reciprocity or I'm sorry
 
03:50:39.050 --> 03:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
respical toll agreement we have in place
 
03:50:43.010 --> 03:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
the department opposes HB 486 which will
 
03:50:44.750 --> 03:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate the reciprocity toll
 
03:50:46.190 --> 03:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
collection enforcement agreement with
 
03:50:48.290 --> 03:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
mass of Maine which has been in place
 
03:50:50.450 --> 03:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
since 2011.
 
03:50:52.250 --> 03:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
this presents a problem for the toll
 
03:50:54.950 --> 03:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
system of enforcement of toll violators
 
03:50:57.590 --> 03:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
from Maine and mass in other words we
 
03:50:59.570 --> 03:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
will not be able to collect tolls from
 
03:51:01.969 --> 03:51:01.979 align:start position:0%
Main and mass and they will just be able
 
03:51:06.229 --> 03:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
to ride through through our system free
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
to try to explain how this process works
 
03:51:10.809 --> 03:51:10.819 align:start position:0%
from the lane
 
03:51:13.490 --> 03:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
as a person passes through electronic
 
03:51:16.070 --> 03:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
tolling without a transponder our
 
03:51:17.690 --> 03:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
violation system takes a picture of
 
03:51:19.190 --> 03:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
their license plate
 
03:51:23.150 --> 03:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
the transactions and images from the
 
03:51:26.210 --> 03:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
from the lane system go to our Easy Pass
 
03:51:28.130 --> 03:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
back office vendor
 
03:51:30.229 --> 03:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
they go through and they view the images
 
03:51:32.450 --> 03:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
and they get the plate State the plate
 
03:51:34.429 --> 03:51:34.439 align:start position:0%
number and the plate type
 
03:51:36.530 --> 03:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
and what that allows them to do is we
 
03:51:39.950 --> 03:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
send out a file to the DMVs mass in
 
03:51:41.809 --> 03:51:41.819 align:start position:0%
Maine New Hampshire and five other
 
03:51:44.950 --> 03:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
states to get the owner of the vehicles
 
03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
name address
 
03:51:49.969 --> 03:51:49.979 align:start position:0%
so we can send them an invoice
 
03:51:52.490 --> 03:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
we typically send first invoice we sent
 
03:51:54.769 --> 03:51:54.779 align:start position:0%
out they have 30 days to pay
 
03:51:57.290 --> 03:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
if they don't pay that invoice they get
 
03:51:59.929 --> 03:51:59.939 align:start position:0%
a second invoice and they have another
 
03:52:02.510 --> 03:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
30 days to pay that invoice is actually
 
03:52:04.849 --> 03:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
pink so it stands out more to get their
 
03:52:04.859 --> 03:52:05.929 align:start position:0%
pink so it stands out more to get their
attention

03:52:05.929 --> 03:52:05.939 align:start position:0%
attention
 
03:52:08.090 --> 03:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
and if they don't pay that invoice we
 
03:52:10.250 --> 03:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
sent out a violation notice which they
 
03:52:13.309 --> 03:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
have another 30 days to pay
 
03:52:15.530 --> 03:52:15.540 align:start position:0%
now before we can put somebody in DMV
 
03:52:18.050 --> 03:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
hold the suspension of the registration
 
03:52:21.530 --> 03:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
they have to collect up to there has to
 
03:52:23.570 --> 03:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
be 10 transactions where they were at a
 
03:52:26.330 --> 03:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
violation level notice we can't just do
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
it on one transaction they have to have
 
03:52:29.990 --> 03:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
up to 10.
 
03:52:32.570 --> 03:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
and before we even send somebody to DMV
 
03:52:34.910 --> 03:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
hold we reach out to the customer again
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
in a letter from the Department of
 
03:52:40.490 --> 03:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
Transportation and offering them a
 
03:52:42.710 --> 03:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
settlement to pay before we send them to
 
03:52:44.630 --> 03:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
DMV which they would get their
 
03:52:47.570 --> 03:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
registration suspended they get 30 days
 
03:52:49.610 --> 03:52:49.620 align:start position:0%
to pay that settlement if they don't pay
 
03:52:52.910 --> 03:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
then we get we send them to the DMV and
 
03:52:55.550 --> 03:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
DMV puts the registration in suspension
 
03:52:59.150 --> 03:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
or potential suspension DMV sends them
 
03:53:01.490 --> 03:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
out a letter and gives them 30 days to
 
03:53:01.500 --> 03:53:02.410 align:start position:0%
out a letter and gives them 30 days to
pay

03:53:02.410 --> 03:53:02.420 align:start position:0%
pay
 
03:53:04.610 --> 03:53:04.620 align:start position:0%
and then if they don't pay the
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:11.750 --> 03:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
the registration owner of these vehicles
 
03:53:14.150 --> 03:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
gets several notices
 
03:53:16.429 --> 03:53:16.439 align:start position:0%
we're typically not dealing with people
 
03:53:19.130 --> 03:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
with 10 transactions we're dealing with
 
03:53:22.309 --> 03:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
several hundreds of transactions people
 
03:53:25.610 --> 03:53:25.620 align:start position:0%
over 500 in tolls
 
03:53:28.130 --> 03:53:28.140 align:start position:0%
um these obituary offenders get a lot of
 
03:53:31.190 --> 03:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
mail and they get every they get first
 
03:53:33.290 --> 03:53:33.300 align:start position:0%
invoice second device violation for
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
every time we're sending these out to
 
03:53:34.800 --> 03:53:36.590 align:start position:0%
every time we're sending these out to
them

03:53:36.590 --> 03:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:53:38.510 --> 03:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
um to give you an idea of how many
 
03:53:40.849 --> 03:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
images are back office vendor is
 
03:53:44.150 --> 03:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
reviewing in November there was 1.3
 
03:53:46.729 --> 03:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
million images that they reviewed of
 
03:53:49.010 --> 03:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
license plates of vehicles who went
 
03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
through the toll plaza where we didn't
 
03:53:52.969 --> 03:53:52.979 align:start position:0%
have we didn't collect an Easy Pass
 
03:53:52.979 --> 03:53:54.710 align:start position:0%
have we didn't collect an Easy Pass
transponder

03:53:54.710 --> 03:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
transponder
 
03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
of those images 51 of New Hampshire 24
 
03:54:01.490 --> 03:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
were mass and seven percent were mean
 
03:54:04.250 --> 03:54:04.260 align:start position:0%
out of the other states it was that went
 
03:54:09.290 --> 03:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
from 1.3 percent to to almost nothing
 
03:54:11.210 --> 03:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
um and that's why we have the
 
03:54:13.130 --> 03:54:13.140 align:start position:0%
reciprocity agreements which is mass and
 
03:54:14.570 --> 03:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
Maine our neighboring states because
 
03:54:17.210 --> 03:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
they're the majority of the customers
 
03:54:20.690 --> 03:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
who fail to pay their toll
 
03:54:22.790 --> 03:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
and presently our DMV whole process with
 
03:54:25.130 --> 03:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
mass and Maine we are only limit to send
 
03:54:28.309 --> 03:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
20 holds a month to them and that's
 
03:54:31.250 --> 03:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
because it's a manual effort
 
03:54:33.889 --> 03:54:33.899 align:start position:0%
um currently the hold files have
 
03:54:36.530 --> 03:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
increased over the past three years due
 
03:54:38.870 --> 03:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
to covid and also electric electronic
 
03:54:38.880 --> 03:54:40.269 align:start position:0%
to covid and also electric electronic
tolling

03:54:40.269 --> 03:54:40.279 align:start position:0%
tolling
 
03:54:44.030 --> 03:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
for Mass they are the more I'll say we
 
03:54:46.429 --> 03:54:46.439 align:start position:0%
have more holes with mass than Maine
 
03:54:50.090 --> 03:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
and in 2020 there were 9 000 holds
 
03:54:50.100 --> 03:54:52.030 align:start position:0%
and in 2020 there were 9 000 holds
created

03:54:52.030 --> 03:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
created
 
03:54:56.229 --> 03:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
2022 there were 14 000 holds created
 
03:54:59.590 --> 03:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
of those three years we had an average
 
03:55:02.689 --> 03:55:02.699 align:start position:0%
paid about 2500 paid and that was
 
03:55:04.250 --> 03:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
approximately eighty thousand dollars in
 
03:55:04.260 --> 03:55:06.229 align:start position:0%
approximately eighty thousand dollars in
tolls

03:55:06.229 --> 03:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
tolls
 
03:55:08.630 --> 03:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
um still outstanding in mass and a
 
03:55:10.610 --> 03:55:10.620 align:start position:0%
three-year average is like 11 000 holds
 
03:55:13.910 --> 03:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
and that's about 228 000 dollars in
 
03:55:16.370 --> 03:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
tolls that is mainly because we have
 
03:55:19.490 --> 03:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
that 20 20 per month limit
 
03:55:22.429 --> 03:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
Maine is a little less main we have
 
03:55:27.550 --> 03:55:27.560 align:start position:0%
around 2500 holds in 2020 up to
 
03:55:30.590 --> 03:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
3500 in 2022.
 
03:55:34.429 --> 03:55:34.439 align:start position:0%
the average for those three years we had
 
03:55:36.769 --> 03:55:36.779 align:start position:0%
500 holds paid and there was about 11
 
03:55:38.750 --> 03:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
000 tolls
 
03:55:40.849 --> 03:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
um and then the outstanding holds for
 
03:55:42.530 --> 03:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
them is around three thousand it's only
 
03:55:46.309 --> 03:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
ninety five thousand dollars in tolls
 
03:55:48.530 --> 03:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
um we are working with mass and Main to
 
03:55:50.330 --> 03:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
try to automate the system instead of
 
03:55:52.490 --> 03:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
making it manual so we could send more
 
03:55:56.570 --> 03:55:56.580 align:start position:0%
holds out and go after the the ones that
 
03:55:58.790 --> 03:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
are still outstanding
 
03:56:00.110 --> 03:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
for the reasons above the department
 
03:56:02.929 --> 03:56:02.939 align:start position:0%
opposes the HBO 486 for this
 
03:56:04.610 --> 03:56:04.620 align:start position:0%
discontinuation so the risk processity
 
03:56:05.750 --> 03:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
agreements with mass and Maine
 
03:56:08.150 --> 03:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
especially due to the loss of Revenue
 
03:56:10.670 --> 03:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
and not treating New Hampshire residents
 
03:56:12.410 --> 03:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
similar to the violators from other
 
03:56:14.450 --> 03:56:14.460 align:start position:0%
neighboring states with the suspension
 
03:56:15.950 --> 03:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
of registration
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony and I'm
 
03:56:20.990 --> 03:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
03:56:22.010 --> 03:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:56:22.020 --> 03:56:23.570 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
representative

03:56:23.570 --> 03:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:56:25.250 --> 03:56:25.260 align:start position:0%
yes do you have that testimony in
 
03:56:25.260 --> 03:56:27.110 align:start position:0%
yes do you have that testimony in
writing

03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
writing
 
03:56:30.889 --> 03:56:30.899 align:start position:0%
um no these are my notes we can
 
03:56:33.530 --> 03:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
would you be kind enough to share those
 
03:56:35.809 --> 03:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
notes yes yes it was very helpful you
 
03:56:37.309 --> 03:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
gave us a lot of great data points that
 
03:56:39.950 --> 03:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
I think we'd like to think about
 
03:56:41.809 --> 03:56:41.819 align:start position:0%
uh I see a bunch of hands over here
 
03:56:43.250 --> 03:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy did you have a
 
03:56:44.990 --> 03:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
question okay representative Britain did
 
03:56:46.610 --> 03:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
03:56:48.290 --> 03:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
03:56:49.670 --> 03:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple couple of quick
 
03:56:51.170 --> 03:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
questions once what are the other five
 
03:56:53.389 --> 03:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
states that are included with mass Maine
 
03:56:54.830 --> 03:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire
 
03:56:56.809 --> 03:56:56.819 align:start position:0%
um we also do address lookup with uh
 
03:56:58.849 --> 03:56:58.859 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Vermont
 
03:57:03.729 --> 03:57:03.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:05.750 --> 03:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
also ask
 
03:57:07.729 --> 03:57:07.739 align:start position:0%
um what kind of punishments they might
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
do with shirkers of out-of-state tolls
 
03:57:13.790 --> 03:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
similar to New Hampshire or what
 
03:57:13.800 --> 03:57:15.590 align:start position:0%
similar to New Hampshire or what
um

03:57:15.590 --> 03:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:18.889 --> 03:57:18.899 align:start position:0%
the only only ones I know with is mass
 
03:57:20.389 --> 03:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
in Maine and New Hampshire were the ones
 
03:57:21.650 --> 03:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
who have the risk of process agreement
 
03:57:23.870 --> 03:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
where we're allowed to suspend the
 
03:57:23.880 --> 03:57:25.550 align:start position:0%
where we're allowed to suspend the
registrations

03:57:25.550 --> 03:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
registrations
 
03:57:27.290 --> 03:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
um like with New York if we send
 
03:57:29.269 --> 03:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
invoices out to them and if they don't
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
pay it just it just sits there we don't
 
03:57:34.450 --> 03:57:34.460 align:start position:0%
have a reciprocity agreement with them
 
03:57:36.650 --> 03:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
and typically
 
03:57:38.450 --> 03:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
it's just our neighboring states because
 
03:57:40.969 --> 03:57:40.979 align:start position:0%
they're the I'll say the the biggest
 
03:57:43.610 --> 03:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
customers who don't pay the toll
 
03:57:46.550 --> 03:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know the other states it's a lot
 
03:57:48.469 --> 03:57:48.479 align:start position:0%
lower are the invoices that we send out
 
03:57:48.479 --> 03:57:49.550 align:start position:0%
lower are the invoices that we send out
to

03:57:49.550 --> 03:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:57:51.670 --> 03:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
like somebody was talking about Florida
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
we don't go out and get sending voices
 
03:57:57.349 --> 03:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
to Florida sometimes it costs you more
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
money to just create that invoice and
 
03:58:02.689 --> 03:58:02.699 align:start position:0%
and pay for the DMV lookup and send it
 
03:58:05.150 --> 03:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
out to that customer in Florida
 
03:58:05.160 --> 03:58:06.530 align:start position:0%
out to that customer in Florida
oh

03:58:06.530 --> 03:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:58:08.269 --> 03:58:08.279 align:start position:0%
okay I think I saw more hands over here
 
03:58:10.429 --> 03:58:10.439 align:start position:0%
representative has a question thank you
 
03:58:11.870 --> 03:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
madam Chan thank you for taking my
 
03:58:11.880 --> 03:58:13.130 align:start position:0%
madam Chan thank you for taking my
question

03:58:13.130 --> 03:58:13.140 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:58:13.140 --> 03:58:13.849 align:start position:0%
question
um

03:58:13.849 --> 03:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:16.729 --> 03:58:16.739 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm I'm a little confused your
 
03:58:19.370 --> 03:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
testimony stated that if if this
 
03:58:21.769 --> 03:58:21.779 align:start position:0%
component and the way I read this
 
03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation it talks about the
 
03:58:26.929 --> 03:58:26.939 align:start position:0%
enforcement end of things relative to
 
03:58:29.450 --> 03:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
suspending a registration but you're
 
03:58:34.429 --> 03:58:34.439 align:start position:0%
saying in the reciprocity agreement that
 
03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
if we were to suspend this component we
 
03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to collect tolls from
 
03:58:42.170 --> 03:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
neighboring states with the Easy Pass
 
03:58:42.180 --> 03:58:44.750 align:start position:0%
neighboring states with the Easy Pass
transponder

03:58:44.750 --> 03:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
transponder
 
03:58:46.969 --> 03:58:46.979 align:start position:0%
um with any Easy Pass transponder we
 
03:58:49.130 --> 03:58:49.140 align:start position:0%
collect tolls it's the people who don't
 
03:58:51.229 --> 03:58:51.239 align:start position:0%
have a transponder who are going through
 
03:58:53.929 --> 03:58:53.939 align:start position:0%
you know with no
 
03:58:55.969 --> 03:58:55.979 align:start position:0%
um transponder and we're sending
 
03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
invoices to them we still the in the
 
03:59:01.189 --> 03:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
risk process agreement gives us the
 
03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement of DMV hold you know to
 
03:59:05.870 --> 03:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
suspend their registration so people
 
03:59:09.290 --> 03:59:09.300 align:start position:0%
will pay if you don't have that you know
 
03:59:12.410 --> 03:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
there's no strong arm behind that to get
 
03:59:14.269 --> 03:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
them to pay
 
03:59:17.269 --> 03:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
follow up just a follow-up I believe he
 
03:59:19.309 --> 03:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
testified that there were over a million
 
03:59:19.319 --> 03:59:20.210 align:start position:0%
testified that there were over a million
of

03:59:20.210 --> 03:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
of uh vehicles that went through the
 
03:59:25.370 --> 03:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
toll that did not have or did not
 
03:59:28.189 --> 03:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
register an easy pass those were there
 
03:59:31.550 --> 03:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
was a 1.3 million of images our vendor
 
03:59:33.830 --> 03:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
reviewed they usually get two images per
 
03:59:33.840 --> 03:59:34.990 align:start position:0%
reviewed they usually get two images per
transaction

03:59:34.990 --> 03:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
03:59:37.610 --> 03:59:37.620 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you some of those at
 
03:59:40.250 --> 03:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
least 50 percent of those images end up
 
03:59:43.490 --> 03:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
being come in image tolls and what that
 
03:59:44.809 --> 03:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
is that's
 
03:59:47.630 --> 03:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
um an Easy Pass account holder who might
 
03:59:50.150 --> 03:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
not have had their transponder mounted
 
03:59:50.160 --> 03:59:51.769 align:start position:0%
not have had their transponder mounted
or

03:59:51.769 --> 03:59:51.779 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:59:54.710 --> 03:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
um it may be the battery's dead and that
 
03:59:56.630 --> 03:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
we pick up their license plate and their
 
03:59:58.189 --> 03:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
license plate is a tie to their account
 
04:00:00.290 --> 04:00:00.300 align:start position:0%
so we charge their account still that
 
04:00:00.300 --> 04:00:01.010 align:start position:0%
so we charge their account still that
way

04:00:01.010 --> 04:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:00:03.889 --> 04:00:03.899 align:start position:0%
it's just all the images I was trying to
 
04:00:05.870 --> 04:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
explain that how many are from New
 
04:00:10.189 --> 04:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
and and not to belabor this but I I
 
04:00:14.150 --> 04:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
guess you'd have to look at the language
 
04:00:16.910 --> 04:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
of the reciprocity agreement but
 
04:00:20.750 --> 04:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
so is it your opinion and or a testimony
 
04:00:22.969 --> 04:00:22.979 align:start position:0%
that if
 
04:00:24.769 --> 04:00:24.779 align:start position:0%
we suspend
 
04:00:27.110 --> 04:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
this component here as far as suspending
 
04:00:30.490 --> 04:00:30.500 align:start position:0%
registrations that the other states
 
04:00:34.269 --> 04:00:34.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Maine would not
 
04:00:37.070 --> 04:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
assist the state of New Hampshire
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
DMV in collection of those outstanding
 
04:00:41.870 --> 04:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
calls or is there something in that
 
04:00:43.670 --> 04:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
language in that reciprocity agreement
 
04:00:46.250 --> 04:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
that allows for that or can you answer
 
04:00:46.260 --> 04:00:47.150 align:start position:0%
that allows for that or can you answer
that

04:00:47.150 --> 04:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:00:50.570 --> 04:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
the suspending the reciprocity agreement
 
04:00:52.809 --> 04:00:52.819 align:start position:0%
will still allow us to get address
 
04:00:57.469 --> 04:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
addresses from Mass and Main DMV to send
 
04:01:00.889 --> 04:01:00.899 align:start position:0%
out invoices to it's just after these
 
04:01:02.510 --> 04:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
people they get up to the violation
 
04:01:04.670 --> 04:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
notice and they still don't pay and
 
04:01:06.769 --> 04:01:06.779 align:start position:0%
there's up to 10 of them you know when
 
04:01:09.170 --> 04:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
it goes over 10 then we submit them in
 
04:01:11.710 --> 04:01:11.720 align:start position:0%
hold and that's sort of the strong arm
 
04:01:14.030 --> 04:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
so they can't read they have to register
 
04:01:15.170 --> 04:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
the vehicle
 
04:01:17.630 --> 04:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
they have to pay the Easy Pass tolls
 
04:01:17.640 --> 04:01:18.410 align:start position:0%
they have to pay the Easy Pass tolls
first

04:01:18.410 --> 04:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:01:21.710 --> 04:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:21.720 --> 04:01:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:01:23.510 --> 04:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:01:24.769 --> 04:01:24.779 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:01:27.830 --> 04:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question so the concern
 
04:01:30.229 --> 04:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
um earlier was that
 
04:01:32.809 --> 04:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
you could unknowingly you know
 
04:01:35.809 --> 04:01:35.819 align:start position:0%
get a toll that you didn't pay and then
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
suddenly you can't register your vehicle
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
but from what you're saying
 
04:01:41.450 --> 04:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
it's going to take at least 10
 
04:01:44.510 --> 04:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
of these non-paid tolls until it even
 
04:01:46.790 --> 04:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
registers until it becomes a problem you
 
04:01:48.229 --> 04:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
can't register your vehicle they'll
 
04:01:50.929 --> 04:01:50.939 align:start position:0%
become before that they have ability to
 
04:01:52.670 --> 04:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
go into DMV hold
 
04:01:55.370 --> 04:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
you know I'll tell you since the backlog
 
04:01:57.229 --> 04:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
um somebody with one DMV hold we
 
04:02:03.229 --> 04:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
are luckily going to touch them over the
 
04:02:06.349 --> 04:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
next couple years there's so much bigger
 
04:02:06.359 --> 04:02:07.210 align:start position:0%
next couple years there's so much bigger
um

04:02:07.210 --> 04:02:07.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:14.750 --> 04:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:16.370 --> 04:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
representative fellows has a question
 
04:02:18.050 --> 04:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:02:20.809 --> 04:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
um I just for people who have suppose
 
04:02:22.550 --> 04:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
somebody has a transponder and it's not
 
04:02:24.010 --> 04:02:24.020 align:start position:0%
working correctly
 
04:02:28.250 --> 04:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
in in their uh New Hampshire person and
 
04:02:32.990 --> 04:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
do what is the method that you would try
 
04:02:36.769 --> 04:02:36.779 align:start position:0%
to contact them by do you have emails or
 
04:02:38.570 --> 04:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
do you only have
 
04:02:42.889 --> 04:02:42.899 align:start position:0%
um post office addresses if
 
04:02:45.530 --> 04:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
if a New Hampshire customer is going
 
04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
through the toll plaza and say I was
 
04:02:52.490 --> 04:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
mentioning image image tolls if you get
 
04:02:56.570 --> 04:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
10 image tolls in a row we send out
 
04:02:59.689 --> 04:02:59.699 align:start position:0%
first we send out a text message if
 
04:03:01.969 --> 04:03:01.979 align:start position:0%
there's a cell phone on there we send an
 
04:03:04.670 --> 04:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
email out and then we send a letter out
 
04:03:07.969 --> 04:03:07.979 align:start position:0%
there's certain like it's I think it's
 
04:03:10.910 --> 04:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
15 days and 30 days and then
 
04:03:13.370 --> 04:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
up to 45 days
 
04:03:15.650 --> 04:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
um I can't as if that's the exact number
 
04:03:17.570 --> 04:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
but we tried to reach out to them to
 
04:03:19.790 --> 04:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
tell them and then we say that either
 
04:03:23.450 --> 04:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
your transponder is dying or you it's
 
04:03:25.849 --> 04:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
not mounted correctly and we remind them
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
too when it is an image toll they don't
 
04:03:30.530 --> 04:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
get the discount too
 
04:03:30.540 --> 04:03:33.229 align:start position:0%
get the discount too
so

04:03:33.229 --> 04:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:35.030 --> 04:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes do you have any comment about the
 
04:03:37.610 --> 04:03:37.620 align:start position:0%
250 dollar fine assume you're not that's
 
04:03:41.150 --> 04:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
DMV business that is DMV I I'm not
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:48.290 --> 04:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
04:03:50.330 --> 04:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
04:03:50.340 --> 04:03:51.590 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
um

04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:56.410 --> 04:03:56.420 align:start position:0%
which if any of these states uh
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
suspends the license of their drivers
 
04:04:06.650 --> 04:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:09.170 --> 04:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
um mass in Maine if
 
04:04:09.180 --> 04:04:09.950 align:start position:0%
um mass in Maine if
um

04:04:09.950 --> 04:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
if a person in mass is violating New
 
04:04:14.929 --> 04:04:14.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we get their license plate
 
04:04:17.809 --> 04:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
and send them all the invoices and stuff
 
04:04:21.110 --> 04:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned we send it to mass DMV
 
04:04:24.170 --> 04:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
and then they suspend their registration
 
04:04:26.689 --> 04:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
to pay New Hampshire tolls it's only
 
04:04:28.790 --> 04:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
mass and Maine that we're allowed to do
 
04:04:29.929 --> 04:04:29.939 align:start position:0%
that with
 
04:04:29.939 --> 04:04:32.870 align:start position:0%
that with
follow-up

04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
so from an enforcement perspective
 
04:04:40.010 --> 04:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a revenue perspective
 
04:04:42.349 --> 04:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
which do you think is more valuable to
 
04:04:45.110 --> 04:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
you your Department's objectives
 
04:04:48.950 --> 04:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
to induce those other states to suspend
 
04:04:51.050 --> 04:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
their drivers who are violating while
 
04:04:52.969 --> 04:04:52.979 align:start position:0%
traveling on our roads
 
04:04:55.849 --> 04:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
or to suspend our drivers when they're
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:01.439 --> 04:05:04.490 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:05:04.490 --> 04:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:07.670 --> 04:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
the whole re reciprocity enforcement is
 
04:05:09.889 --> 04:05:09.899 align:start position:0%
important to us just because and it's
 
04:05:12.170 --> 04:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
important to mass in Maine too because
 
04:05:16.370 --> 04:05:16.380 align:start position:0%
typically the highest violators are are
 
04:05:18.830 --> 04:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
your neighboring states who have tolling
 
04:05:21.530 --> 04:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
you know a tolling system like Vermont
 
04:05:23.210 --> 04:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
is not very high
 
04:05:26.090 --> 04:05:26.100 align:start position:0%
so it is important to us to be able to
 
04:05:28.370 --> 04:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
when somebody is violating a mass remain
 
04:05:30.050 --> 04:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
on our system
 
04:05:32.450 --> 04:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
you know New Hampshire tolls to allow us
 
04:05:36.010 --> 04:05:36.020 align:start position:0%
to go and do the registration suspension
 
04:05:39.530 --> 04:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
to mass and then they they do the
 
04:05:42.229 --> 04:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
similar thing is our New Hampshire does
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
sends out a letter to them and informs
 
04:05:45.410 --> 04:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
them and tells them it's New Hampshire
 
04:05:47.929 --> 04:05:47.939 align:start position:0%
tolls you've got to pay
 
04:05:50.510 --> 04:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
um and mass does the same thing mass
 
04:05:52.010 --> 04:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
remain does the same thing with New
 
04:05:53.870 --> 04:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire customers who are driving on
 
04:05:55.729 --> 04:05:55.739 align:start position:0%
their system
 
04:05:59.630 --> 04:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:01.490 --> 04:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I answered your question
 
04:06:01.500 --> 04:06:02.809 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I answered your question
or

04:06:02.809 --> 04:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:06:04.670 --> 04:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
I'll just characterize it as a
 
04:06:06.490 --> 04:06:06.500 align:start position:0%
frustrating answer
 
04:06:09.349 --> 04:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative has a question yes thank
 
04:06:10.849 --> 04:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:06:13.490 --> 04:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
explaining and I I do look forward to
 
04:06:16.130 --> 04:06:16.140 align:start position:0%
some some written information because
 
04:06:17.450 --> 04:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
you've you've provided a lot of
 
04:06:18.710 --> 04:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
information that I think will be very
 
04:06:21.410 --> 04:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
helpful to us one one of the things that
 
04:06:22.969 --> 04:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
you mentioned was that New Hampshire
 
04:06:25.429 --> 04:06:25.439 align:start position:0%
won't take action unless there's 10
 
04:06:28.969 --> 04:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
transactions or violations
 
04:06:31.849 --> 04:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
um so I'm assuming then that that's a
 
04:06:33.530 --> 04:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts vehicle that's coming here
 
04:06:35.630 --> 04:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
and violating 10 times before you would
 
04:06:39.110 --> 04:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
send a reciprocity type action
 
04:06:41.210 --> 04:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
how many violations does it take Maine
 
04:06:43.130 --> 04:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
or Massachusetts
 
04:06:45.229 --> 04:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
for them to take action against one of
 
04:06:47.929 --> 04:06:47.939 align:start position:0%
our drivers they have to follow the same
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
rules as us it's all ten we all agree to
 
04:06:53.210 --> 04:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
that it's all part of the reciprocity
 
04:06:53.220 --> 04:06:55.030 align:start position:0%
that it's all part of the reciprocity
agreement

04:06:55.030 --> 04:06:55.040 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative Saudi did you have a
 
04:06:56.880 --> 04:06:58.010 align:start position:0%
representative Saudi did you have a
question

04:06:58.010 --> 04:06:58.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:07:00.050 --> 04:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um if I understand
 
04:07:01.849 --> 04:07:01.859 align:start position:0%
correctly there's there's nowhere in the
 
04:07:03.710 --> 04:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
process of getting letters do they get a
 
04:07:06.290 --> 04:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
certified registered letter saying that
 
04:07:07.550 --> 04:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
hey wake up
 
04:07:10.729 --> 04:07:10.739 align:start position:0%
pay this no it's all first class mail no
 
04:07:16.969 --> 04:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:16.979 --> 04:07:18.229 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:07:18.229 --> 04:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:07:20.510 --> 04:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative then representatively
 
04:07:23.269 --> 04:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
after that why can't we read a SunPass
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
or a gold pass from Louisiana or
 
04:07:25.199 --> 04:07:27.290 align:start position:0%
or a gold pass from Louisiana or
whatever

04:07:27.290 --> 04:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:07:29.090 --> 04:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
um we can
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
um Florida which is the sun pass they
 
04:07:34.790 --> 04:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
are part of the Easy Pass system now so
 
04:07:38.090 --> 04:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
we can read them and we do get told we
 
04:07:39.710 --> 04:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
collect toll from them
 
04:07:43.070 --> 04:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
through the Easy Pass transponder
 
04:07:45.349 --> 04:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
and now you can travel
 
04:07:47.150 --> 04:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire all the way down the
 
04:07:52.670 --> 04:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:56.150 --> 04:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative lippley thank you
 
04:07:58.490 --> 04:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
um so if I understand your testimony
 
04:08:02.150 --> 04:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
correctly someone who violates
 
04:08:05.630 --> 04:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
ten times will get a letter with a
 
04:08:05.640 --> 04:08:07.250 align:start position:0%
ten times will get a letter with a
30-day

04:08:07.250 --> 04:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
30-day
 
04:08:10.309 --> 04:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
period within which they can pay a
 
04:08:12.830 --> 04:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
second letter with another 30 days a
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
third letter with another 30 days
 
04:08:18.290 --> 04:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
um they'll get a letter of settlement
 
04:08:20.809 --> 04:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
saying hey you should pay this and if
 
04:08:22.670 --> 04:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
you pay this now you know maybe you'll
 
04:08:24.650 --> 04:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
only have to pay X
 
04:08:27.110 --> 04:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
um that also has 30 days and then you
 
04:08:28.550 --> 04:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
send them
 
04:08:30.650 --> 04:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
um onto the DMV
 
04:08:32.510 --> 04:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
and then they get a letter from the DMV
 
04:08:35.269 --> 04:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
which gives them 30 days to pay
 
04:08:37.849 --> 04:08:37.859 align:start position:0%
so they have 150 days to pay basically
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
before their registration is suspended
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
um and these letters I'm assuming are
 
04:08:47.769 --> 04:08:47.779 align:start position:0%
you're sending them to an address
 
04:08:50.570 --> 04:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
because the person has registered their
 
04:08:52.849 --> 04:08:52.859 align:start position:0%
vehicle with their state
 
04:08:55.250 --> 04:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
and so their address is on on file with
 
04:08:57.050 --> 04:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
our state so it would only be going to
 
04:08:58.969 --> 04:08:58.979 align:start position:0%
an incorrect address
 
04:09:02.929 --> 04:09:02.939 align:start position:0%
if they weren't registered properly with
 
04:09:05.630 --> 04:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
the state and failed to have their mail
 
04:09:07.429 --> 04:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
forwarded for example
 
04:09:10.250 --> 04:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
yes yes you're correct that's how the
 
04:09:13.130 --> 04:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
process is now thank you there are times
 
04:09:15.229 --> 04:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
where we'll get
 
04:09:15.239 --> 04:09:16.070 align:start position:0%
where we'll get
um

04:09:16.070 --> 04:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:18.110 --> 04:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
you know say the person no longer lives
 
04:09:22.010 --> 04:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
there they return mail we do not carry
 
04:09:24.110 --> 04:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
that forward so we wouldn't put anybody
 
04:09:27.889 --> 04:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
in hold or send out additional
 
04:09:30.290 --> 04:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
um invoices or violation if
 
04:09:36.170 --> 04:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:38.809 --> 04:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
that was very helpful thank you anyone
 
04:09:40.790 --> 04:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
else before we yeah representative
 
04:09:43.849 --> 04:09:43.859 align:start position:0%
Spielberg if I make one more
 
04:09:43.859 --> 04:09:44.929 align:start position:0%
Spielberg if I make one more
um

04:09:44.929 --> 04:09:44.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:48.410 --> 04:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
roughly what percentage of the state's
 
04:09:51.110 --> 04:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
roads and I don't just mean State
 
04:09:53.630 --> 04:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
highways I mean roads
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
including locally controlled are covered
 
04:10:02.510 --> 04:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:04.790 --> 04:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire Turnpike system
 
04:10:07.910 --> 04:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's only 83 miles of the turnpike
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
system and that starts it's on in
 
04:10:15.469 --> 04:10:15.479 align:start position:0%
Concord Exit 14 93 and it goes all the
 
04:10:18.650 --> 04:10:18.660 align:start position:0%
way down south to 293 through Manchester
 
04:10:22.370 --> 04:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
to Effie Evert to the mass border and
 
04:10:23.929 --> 04:10:23.939 align:start position:0%
then the
 
04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
um that's called the central Turnpike
 
04:10:28.250 --> 04:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
the blue star is over on the Spalding
 
04:10:29.570 --> 04:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
which is like
 
04:10:32.689 --> 04:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm sorry I-95 which is like 16
 
04:10:35.269 --> 04:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
miles it goes from Mass to Maine then
 
04:10:38.689 --> 04:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
the Spalding Turnpike goes from like
 
04:10:40.849 --> 04:10:40.859 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth Circle it's also known as
 
04:10:45.229 --> 04:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
like Route 16 and it goes up to Milton
 
04:10:47.389 --> 04:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
exit so you're confirming my
 
04:10:47.399 --> 04:10:49.309 align:start position:0%
exit so you're confirming my
understanding

04:10:49.309 --> 04:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:10:52.090 --> 04:10:52.100 align:start position:0%
which is that it's an almost
 
04:10:55.210 --> 04:10:55.220 align:start position:0%
infinitesimally small percentage of the
 
04:10:58.070 --> 04:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
miles I understand they're significant
 
04:11:00.410 --> 04:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
roads and they're well traveled
 
04:11:04.010 --> 04:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
so I think the thrust of this bill
 
04:11:06.290 --> 04:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the notices and
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
the fines it has to do with whether
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
suspension and revocation of a driver's
 
04:11:11.040 --> 04:11:12.410 align:start position:0%
suspension and revocation of a driver's
license

04:11:12.410 --> 04:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:11:15.790 --> 04:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable or a disproportionate
 
04:11:18.650 --> 04:11:18.660 align:start position:0%
penalty device
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
so somebody who violates a toll
 
04:11:25.969 --> 04:11:25.979 align:start position:0%
on that little tiny portion of our
 
04:11:28.969 --> 04:11:28.979 align:start position:0%
roadways effectively is denied the
 
04:11:31.250 --> 04:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to drive on any of our
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
roadways or to drive at all is there a
 
04:11:37.790 --> 04:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
question there I'm sorry uh am I
 
04:11:41.330 --> 04:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
the registration gets suspended yes
 
04:11:44.510 --> 04:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:47.750 --> 04:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
if they don't pay uh yeah
 
04:11:50.210 --> 04:11:50.220 align:start position:0%
do you have a little bit more time yes
 
04:11:52.010 --> 04:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
okay I see a few more hands and I see
 
04:11:53.630 --> 04:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
his hands over here
 
04:11:55.370 --> 04:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
did you have any more questions yes
 
04:11:57.950 --> 04:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative Almy has a question thank
 
04:12:01.550 --> 04:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
you uh what percentage of the revenues
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
that come into the turnpike system are
 
04:12:04.800 --> 04:12:07.130 align:start position:0%
that come into the turnpike system are
tolls

04:12:07.130 --> 04:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
tolls
 
04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:14.210 --> 04:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
and how much
 
04:12:14.220 --> 04:12:19.130 align:start position:0%
and how much
that

04:12:19.130 --> 04:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:21.410 --> 04:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
our bun
 
04:12:24.229 --> 04:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
our bond payments right now this is um
 
04:12:26.510 --> 04:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's around 40 million
 
04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
that we're paying each year
 
04:12:33.050 --> 04:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
um toll Revenue in fiscal year 20
 
04:12:37.490 --> 04:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
um two was around 122 million
 
04:12:37.500 --> 04:12:40.610 align:start position:0%
um two was around 122 million
oh

04:12:40.610 --> 04:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:43.370 --> 04:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
and then with that we're paying for all
 
04:12:47.389 --> 04:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
the operation maintenance and projects
 
04:12:47.399 --> 04:12:48.590 align:start position:0%
the operation maintenance and projects
follow-up

04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:12:52.849 --> 04:12:52.859 align:start position:0%
so on all of the maintenance and
 
04:12:55.910 --> 04:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
extension of the of the turnpike system
 
04:12:58.670 --> 04:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
is from the toll money yes everything's
 
04:13:01.130 --> 04:13:01.140 align:start position:0%

six nine
 
04:15:48.050 --> 04:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
um which I'm sponsor of
 
04:15:49.729 --> 04:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:15:51.530 --> 04:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
I really want to
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
well first you you have papers in front
 
04:15:57.170 --> 04:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
of you that I've handed out there should
 
04:16:01.610 --> 04:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
be three different items I'll point to
 
04:16:01.620 --> 04:16:03.050 align:start position:0%
be three different items I'll point to
them

04:16:03.050 --> 04:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:16:03.060 --> 04:16:03.769 align:start position:0%
them
um

04:16:03.769 --> 04:16:03.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:06.590 --> 04:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
and one of the items is what is
 
04:16:08.389 --> 04:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
basically the notes that I'll follow in
 
04:16:10.610 --> 04:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
trying to present this bill the key
 
04:16:12.130 --> 04:16:12.140 align:start position:0%
elements of
 
04:16:15.650 --> 04:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
569. what I really want to say at the
 
04:16:19.090 --> 04:16:19.100 align:start position:0%
very outset is that this bill is
 
04:16:23.290 --> 04:16:23.300 align:start position:0%
essentially the same as with updates
 
04:16:28.370 --> 04:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
as House Bill 504 from the previous uh
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
two-year session and that bill went
 
04:16:35.150 --> 04:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
through review before this committee was
 
04:16:37.729 --> 04:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
retained I went through an interim
 
04:16:40.910 --> 04:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
interim study process and came out at
 
04:16:44.210 --> 04:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
the end with a uh what's the right
 
04:16:45.790 --> 04:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
wording that
 
04:16:49.250 --> 04:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
a favorable report shall we say
 
04:16:50.630 --> 04:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
ought to be considered for future
 
04:16:50.640 --> 04:16:53.290 align:start position:0%
ought to be considered for future
legislation

04:16:53.290 --> 04:16:53.300 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:16:56.030 --> 04:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
with a unanimous report from this
 
04:17:01.550 --> 04:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.570 --> 04:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
last year also uh get rid of this one
 
04:17:08.809 --> 04:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
piece of paper for you or put it in its
 
04:17:13.389 --> 04:17:13.399 align:start position:0%
place uh at that during that process
 
04:17:17.630 --> 04:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
the committee heard from uh William
 
04:17:21.530 --> 04:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
Arden Bill ardinger he's a well-known
 
04:17:24.189 --> 04:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
tax attorney and constitutional
 
04:17:24.199 --> 04:17:26.229 align:start position:0%
tax attorney and constitutional
lawyer

04:17:26.229 --> 04:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
04:17:28.189 --> 04:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:17:32.330 --> 04:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
uh I had actually worked with him on the
 
04:17:32.340 --> 04:17:33.309 align:start position:0%
uh I had actually worked with him on the
uh

04:17:33.309 --> 04:17:33.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
what was it called the school funding
 
04:17:37.910 --> 04:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
commission he was the governor's
 
04:17:39.889 --> 04:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
appointee and I was appointed by the
 
04:17:43.370 --> 04:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
speaker along with others and uh he and
 
04:17:45.469 --> 04:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
I both being lawyers work closely
 
04:17:48.830 --> 04:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
together I admire the work he does and
 
04:17:50.990 --> 04:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
within the purview of that commission
 
04:17:52.790 --> 04:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
was this question of the Statewide
 
04:17:55.210 --> 04:17:55.220 align:start position:0%
education property tax which this bill
 
04:17:59.389 --> 04:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
addresses and he felt strongly that as
 
04:18:03.229 --> 04:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
it stands now it's uh it violates the
 
04:18:05.929 --> 04:18:05.939 align:start position:0%
Constitution and he felt it important to
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
come to a hearing on this bill and
 
04:18:12.110 --> 04:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
testified to that effect submitting this
 
04:18:15.370 --> 04:18:15.380 align:start position:0%
letter which I have distributed to you
 
04:18:17.870 --> 04:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
at the time I spoke with him just
 
04:18:21.130 --> 04:18:21.140 align:start position:0%
yesterday and he could not be here
 
04:18:23.750 --> 04:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
regretted that because he feels he does
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
really feel strongly about this issue
 
04:18:28.189 --> 04:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
and ask that I present this letter again
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:37.130 --> 04:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
the committee report from last year by
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
the way is at the tail end of this
 
04:18:42.650 --> 04:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
two-page document my I've just reprinted
 
04:18:45.410 --> 04:18:45.420 align:start position:0%
it down at the bottom so you can look at
 
04:18:47.210 --> 04:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
that if you will
 
04:18:47.220 --> 04:18:47.990 align:start position:0%
that if you will
um

04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:52.370 --> 04:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
the the bill itself I'd say is is best
 
04:18:57.170 --> 04:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
considered in in three pieces one is uh
 
04:19:00.189 --> 04:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
the the part that uh
 
04:19:03.950 --> 04:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
that is an essential reform of the
 
04:19:06.469 --> 04:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax the
 
04:19:08.450 --> 04:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
second piece reforms the low and
 
04:19:08.460 --> 04:19:09.349 align:start position:0%
second piece reforms the low and
moderate

04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
moderate
 
04:19:13.210 --> 04:19:13.220 align:start position:0%
uh income homeowner income
 
04:19:16.689 --> 04:19:16.699 align:start position:0%
property tax relief peace
 
04:19:19.610 --> 04:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
that was originally put into the law as
 
04:19:21.349 --> 04:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
part of the enactment of the Statewide
 
04:19:23.210 --> 04:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
education property tax so there's a
 
04:19:27.130 --> 04:19:27.140 align:start position:0%
reform to the taxpayer relief program
 
04:19:29.510 --> 04:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's associated with Statewide
 
04:19:31.670 --> 04:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
education property tax and that's the
 
04:19:34.010 --> 04:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
second piece of this bill and the third
 
04:19:36.469 --> 04:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
is a study committee to look at how
 
04:19:39.889 --> 04:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
those tax relief Provisions might be
 
04:19:41.809 --> 04:19:41.819 align:start position:0%
extended so that they would benefit
 
04:19:41.819 --> 04:19:45.229 align:start position:0%
extended so that they would benefit
renters

04:19:45.229 --> 04:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:47.510 --> 04:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and also to look at other questions
 
04:19:50.689 --> 04:19:50.699 align:start position:0%
that are noted in the bill itself so
 
04:19:53.450 --> 04:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
three pieces so picking up on the first
 
04:19:53.460 --> 04:19:54.889 align:start position:0%
three pieces so picking up on the first
one

04:19:54.889 --> 04:19:54.899 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:19:56.689 --> 04:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
um the Statewide education property tax
 
04:20:00.110 --> 04:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
itself and the reform that's proposed
 
04:20:02.150 --> 04:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
first thing to note is that there's no
 
04:20:04.510 --> 04:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
change here in the rate
 
04:20:07.849 --> 04:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
the rate currently
 
04:20:10.790 --> 04:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
well now say if the rate for
 
04:20:14.469 --> 04:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 the next fiscal year
 
04:20:18.650 --> 04:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
reverts to the statutory rate that has
 
04:20:21.290 --> 04:20:21.300 align:start position:0%
been in place for a long time which
 
04:20:23.030 --> 04:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
requires that the commissioner of
 
04:20:25.570 --> 04:20:25.580 align:start position:0%
Revenue set the rate Statewide rate
 
04:20:29.290 --> 04:20:29.300 align:start position:0%
equalized at a level sufficient to raise
 
04:20:31.790 --> 04:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
363 million dollars
 
04:20:34.689 --> 04:20:34.699 align:start position:0%
and um and then there's a rounding
 
04:20:38.689 --> 04:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
allowance so we can set the rate at uh I
 
04:20:41.210 --> 04:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
think a quarter of Penny
 
04:20:41.220 --> 04:20:41.929 align:start position:0%
think a quarter of Penny
um

04:20:41.929 --> 04:20:41.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:44.630 --> 04:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
yeah quarter Cent
 
04:20:44.640 --> 04:20:45.950 align:start position:0%
yeah quarter Cent
um

04:20:45.950 --> 04:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:49.070 --> 04:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
and so the amount that's raised
 
04:20:52.550 --> 04:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
tends to be just above 363 million
 
04:20:52.560 --> 04:20:54.110 align:start position:0%
tends to be just above 363 million
dollars

04:20:54.110 --> 04:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:20:58.150 --> 04:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
um and uh I I
 
04:21:01.090 --> 04:21:01.100 align:start position:0%
have to say this for fiscal year 24
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
because this year it's 263 million
 
04:21:07.670 --> 04:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
dollars and that's a temporary provision
 
04:21:11.389 --> 04:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
that was put into the budget last uh two
 
04:21:15.950 --> 04:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
years ago and uh and so for the year
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're currently in the tax bills were
 
04:21:22.610 --> 04:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
based on the need to raise 263 million
 
04:21:25.670 --> 04:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
instead of 363 million dollars and your
 
04:21:28.990 --> 04:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
bills reflected that uh going back to
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
363 million dollars means about a dollar
 
04:21:35.469 --> 04:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
44 equalized
 
04:21:38.510 --> 04:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
across the state of course The Equalizer
 
04:21:40.010 --> 04:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
rate is not what you see in your bill
 
04:21:43.130 --> 04:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
because each town has slightly different
 
04:21:47.530 --> 04:21:47.540 align:start position:0%
Fair variances from the equalized level
 
04:21:51.110 --> 04:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
so no no change in the rate in this bill
 
04:21:54.650 --> 04:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
that stays the same remittance to the
 
04:21:58.210 --> 04:21:58.220 align:start position:0%
state however is changed and this bill
 
04:22:01.849 --> 04:22:01.859 align:start position:0%
requires that all collections at the
 
04:22:03.950 --> 04:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
immune the municipalities will continue
 
04:22:06.590 --> 04:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
to collect the tax but the collected
 
04:22:08.290 --> 04:22:08.300 align:start position:0%
money will be
 
04:22:11.030 --> 04:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
remitted to the state
 
04:22:15.590 --> 04:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
but after a hold back of three percent
 
04:22:18.469 --> 04:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
of what is collected by the municipality
 
04:22:22.070 --> 04:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
to cover costs of collection and costs
 
04:22:26.349 --> 04:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
of promoting the taxpayer relief program
 
04:22:29.809 --> 04:22:29.819 align:start position:0%
and that's new the three percent hold
 
04:22:32.030 --> 04:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
back is new and the remission to the
 
04:22:34.309 --> 04:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
state is New
 
04:22:36.650 --> 04:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
um so first on on
 
04:22:40.309 --> 04:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
why remit to the state uh that's what uh
 
04:22:43.250 --> 04:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
Mr ardinger is concerned about the
 
04:22:47.290 --> 04:22:47.300 align:start position:0%
current retention of money locally
 
04:22:50.990 --> 04:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
under the current system
 
04:22:51.000 --> 04:22:52.189 align:start position:0%
under the current system
um

04:22:52.189 --> 04:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:55.610 --> 04:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
the money is retained locally and is
 
04:22:57.769 --> 04:22:57.779 align:start position:0%
passed on to the locals to the school
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
district or School District serving the
 
04:22:59.760 --> 04:23:01.309 align:start position:0%
district or School District serving the
town

04:23:01.309 --> 04:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:23:01.319 --> 04:23:01.990 align:start position:0%
town
um

04:23:01.990 --> 04:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:02.000 --> 04:23:03.710 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:23:03.710 --> 04:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
um the problem the Constitutional
 
04:23:09.229 --> 04:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
problem arises where the town collects
 
04:23:09.239 --> 04:23:10.630 align:start position:0%
problem arises where the town collects
more

04:23:10.630 --> 04:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:23:14.269 --> 04:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
then it's entitlement to adequate
 
04:23:15.889 --> 04:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
education money
 
04:23:19.189 --> 04:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
and the excess above that level these
 
04:23:20.330 --> 04:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
what we
 
04:23:23.330 --> 04:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
refer to as excess swept
 
04:23:28.969 --> 04:23:28.979 align:start position:0%
is also retained and kept and uh in most
 
04:23:32.990 --> 04:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
places is then sort of spent as part of
 
04:23:35.689 --> 04:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
the additional effort that's made on
 
04:23:40.870 --> 04:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
education by that local school district
 
04:23:43.969 --> 04:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
there are some places that have no
 
04:23:45.349 --> 04:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
additional effort because they really
 
04:23:48.110 --> 04:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
don't have any school kids they're small
 
04:23:51.769 --> 04:23:51.779 align:start position:0%
places and uh and in those those
 
04:23:54.050 --> 04:23:54.060 align:start position:0%
situations the money is kept and spent
 
04:23:56.630 --> 04:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
on whatever I don't really know
 
04:23:59.450 --> 04:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
um but they're they're small uh
 
04:23:59.460 --> 04:24:01.790 align:start position:0%
um but they're they're small uh
collections

04:24:01.790 --> 04:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
collections
 
04:24:06.229 --> 04:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
I gave you a handout a spreadsheet
 
04:24:06.239 --> 04:24:07.189 align:start position:0%
I gave you a handout a spreadsheet
um

04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:09.650 --> 04:24:09.660 align:start position:0%
and I'll just explain what's on there
 
04:24:12.050 --> 04:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
you have to take it away and look more
 
04:24:13.450 --> 04:24:13.460 align:start position:0%
closely I'm sure
 
04:24:16.790 --> 04:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
but uh this has all the towns on the
 
04:24:18.070 --> 04:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
left-hand side
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
and uh it also has the school membership
 
04:24:24.650 --> 04:24:24.660 align:start position:0%
on it the total number of pupils a
 
04:24:28.610 --> 04:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
trivia will are coming from each Town
 
04:24:33.050 --> 04:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
um and then what you'll see on here is
 
04:24:36.590 --> 04:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh a number of bars across the page
 
04:24:39.349 --> 04:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
those are the towns that have excess
 
04:24:39.359 --> 04:24:40.910 align:start position:0%
those are the towns that have excess
swept

04:24:40.910 --> 04:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
swept
 
04:24:43.610 --> 04:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
that are collecting more
 
04:24:45.950 --> 04:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
money through the Statewide education
 
04:24:49.189 --> 04:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
property tax then their adequate
 
04:24:49.199 --> 04:24:50.349 align:start position:0%
property tax then their adequate
education

04:24:50.349 --> 04:24:50.359 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:24:53.349 --> 04:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
grant would come to
 
04:24:57.170 --> 04:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
so Alton is the Delta show you on uh if
 
04:24:59.030 --> 04:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
you'll take a look at Alton the first
 
04:25:01.510 --> 04:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
town that you come to
 
04:25:05.110 --> 04:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
alphabetically on the front page
 
04:25:08.769 --> 04:25:08.779 align:start position:0%
you'll see right there in the middle
 
04:25:11.870 --> 04:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh that they've collected I need my
 
04:25:14.809 --> 04:25:14.819 align:start position:0%
glasses I can't even see it one one
 
04:25:17.590 --> 04:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
million thirty nine thousand
 
04:25:20.689 --> 04:25:20.699 align:start position:0%
795 have I got that right
 
04:25:20.699 --> 04:25:21.370 align:start position:0%
795 have I got that right
um

04:25:21.370 --> 04:25:21.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:25.790 --> 04:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
and that that is the balance that's left
 
04:25:29.330 --> 04:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
after what they collected was applied
 
04:25:29.340 --> 04:25:30.469 align:start position:0%
after what they collected was applied
against

04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
against
 
04:25:33.830 --> 04:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
the adequate education money that
 
04:25:36.290 --> 04:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to so they've paid for
 
04:25:37.849 --> 04:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
adequate education they still have
 
04:25:41.510 --> 04:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
leftover 1 million thirty nine thousand
 
04:25:46.969 --> 04:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
and that money is excess swept
 
04:25:49.070 --> 04:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
um that excess swept is retained by
 
04:25:51.830 --> 04:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
Alton I believe it's all applied to
 
04:25:55.910 --> 04:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
other educational costs and um
 
04:26:01.670 --> 04:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
and that's typical of most uh towns that
 
04:26:03.830 --> 04:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
receive excess swept but there are
 
04:26:05.809 --> 04:26:05.819 align:start position:0%
exceptions and again if I can see the
 
04:26:07.490 --> 04:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
darn thing
 
04:26:07.500 --> 04:26:11.510 align:start position:0%
darn thing
um

04:26:11.510 --> 04:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
if you go
 
04:26:14.399 --> 04:26:15.410 align:start position:0%
if you go
yeah

04:26:15.410 --> 04:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:26:19.010 --> 04:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
a good example would be on the next page
 
04:26:20.990 --> 04:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's any example on the
 
04:26:23.750 --> 04:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
first page on the next page let's take
 
04:26:31.189 --> 04:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:31.199 --> 04:26:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
Clarksville

04:26:34.790 --> 04:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:38.450 --> 04:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
no I prefer going to go down to dixville
 
04:26:41.570 --> 04:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
let's go down to Dick's film
 
04:26:43.910 --> 04:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
um you see that Dixfield doesn't have
 
04:26:46.429 --> 04:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
any school kids
 
04:26:50.590 --> 04:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
they're still assessing Swift
 
04:26:54.130 --> 04:26:54.140 align:start position:0%
and Dixfield is receiving 14
 
04:26:56.570 --> 04:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
591 dollars
 
04:27:00.469 --> 04:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:03.889 --> 04:27:03.899 align:start position:0%
um and it then has
 
04:27:07.490 --> 04:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
on its tax bill according to what uh the
 
04:27:10.729 --> 04:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
dra puts out each year
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
um a negative
 
04:27:16.550 --> 04:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
tax rate for its local education rate of
 
04:27:19.630 --> 04:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
52 cents per thousand
 
04:27:22.370 --> 04:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of information on this
 
04:27:25.130 --> 04:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
uh take a good look at it one other
 
04:27:26.809 --> 04:27:26.819 align:start position:0%
column that I should mention is the
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
three percent uh that's now going to be
 
04:27:31.910 --> 04:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
allowed If This Were to pass
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
um as a amount an amount retained at the
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
local level going back to Alton at the
 
04:27:40.969 --> 04:27:40.979 align:start position:0%
top you'll see that the uh the three
 
04:27:44.870 --> 04:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
percent retention is column K is a
 
04:27:46.969 --> 04:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
hundred and thirteen thousand dollars so
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
that would be new Revenue to to Alton
 
04:27:51.950 --> 04:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
that they didn't have before they would
 
04:27:54.050 --> 04:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
of course be giving up the excess swept
 
04:27:57.290 --> 04:27:57.300 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't really balance out
 
04:28:02.170 --> 04:28:02.180 align:start position:0%
um the the reason for pushing uh for
 
04:28:05.210 --> 04:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
remission of excess swept to the state
 
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
is really legal it is felt by
 
04:28:12.649 --> 04:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh lawyers who look at
 
04:28:16.010 --> 04:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
this not all I should say there's a
 
04:28:18.889 --> 04:28:18.899 align:start position:0%
disagreement on this but that this in
 
04:28:21.649 --> 04:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
effect the results in a disproportionate
 
04:28:25.670 --> 04:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
tax this is a Statewide tax and you have
 
04:28:28.490 --> 04:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
a town if a town is allowed to keep part
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
of it for reasons that are independent
 
04:28:36.250 --> 04:28:36.260 align:start position:0%
of any Statewide spending program
 
04:28:40.729 --> 04:28:40.739 align:start position:0%
then that becomes a disproportional tax
 
04:28:45.410 --> 04:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
and uh and uh and certainly jeopardizes
 
04:28:47.889 --> 04:28:47.899 align:start position:0%
its constitutionality
 
04:28:51.110 --> 04:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
the the question is now before the
 
04:28:53.990 --> 04:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
Superior Court in litigation that's
 
04:28:57.830 --> 04:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing it's called the Rand V State of
 
04:29:00.050 --> 04:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire case
 
04:29:00.060 --> 04:29:00.649 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire case
um

04:29:00.649 --> 04:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:03.769 --> 04:29:03.779 align:start position:0%
so the second part of the bill is uh is
 
04:29:05.630 --> 04:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
changing the
 
04:29:10.370 --> 04:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer uh refund system making it
 
04:29:11.809 --> 04:29:11.819 align:start position:0%
far more generous
 
04:29:15.349 --> 04:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
it makes it more generous but and and
 
04:29:17.990 --> 04:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
all of the refunds would be paid out of
 
04:29:21.469 --> 04:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
swept collections it uh
 
04:29:24.889 --> 04:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
it makes it far more generous by
 
04:29:24.899 --> 04:29:26.590 align:start position:0%
it makes it far more generous by
um

04:29:26.590 --> 04:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
extending the calculation of the tax
 
04:29:32.689 --> 04:29:32.699 align:start position:0%
that can be subject to a refund to the
 
04:29:34.689 --> 04:29:34.699 align:start position:0%
local education tax
 
04:29:38.929 --> 04:29:38.939 align:start position:0%
revenues as well as the swept revenues
 
04:29:41.149 --> 04:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
um so that for a particular taxpayer
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
they'd look at their tax Bill and they
 
04:29:46.849 --> 04:29:46.859 align:start position:0%
have the swept amount there and also
 
04:29:50.210 --> 04:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
this school tax amount and those
 
04:29:52.670 --> 04:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
together would be the amount that would
 
04:29:56.090 --> 04:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
be eligible for a consideration for a
 
04:29:58.130 --> 04:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
refund I'm not going to go through the
 
04:30:00.710 --> 04:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
detail but there there's sort of a
 
04:30:06.530 --> 04:30:06.540 align:start position:0%
laddered uh a sliding scale that that
 
04:30:08.929 --> 04:30:08.939 align:start position:0%
means that the low-income property
 
04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers get a get a hundred percent of
 
04:30:17.689 --> 04:30:17.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:20.929 --> 04:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
up up to up to a point it's kind of
 
04:30:22.550 --> 04:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
complicated I don't want to take up too
 
04:30:26.090 --> 04:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
much time here so I'm trying to do it
 
04:30:28.309 --> 04:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
without going into that detail but there
 
04:30:30.590 --> 04:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
is a sliding scale and you get more of
 
04:30:34.250 --> 04:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
your very low income and if you're
 
04:30:37.370 --> 04:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
sitting in a house that has uh some
 
04:30:39.070 --> 04:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
value to it
 
04:30:44.809 --> 04:30:44.819 align:start position:0%
and then it it go it goes down as you
 
04:30:47.389 --> 04:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
your income goes up to a point where you
 
04:30:49.309 --> 04:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
receive nothing you know no longer
 
04:30:49.319 --> 04:30:50.929 align:start position:0%
receive nothing you know no longer
eligible

04:30:50.929 --> 04:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
um so that's the second part of it you
 
04:30:54.830 --> 04:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
can look more closely at that I I think
 
04:30:57.410 --> 04:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
it's a good good set of numbers that are
 
04:31:00.050 --> 04:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
in that they're always there's always a
 
04:31:01.550 --> 04:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
better way to do it so I'm completely
 
04:31:04.849 --> 04:31:04.859 align:start position:0%
flexible on that part of the bill
 
04:31:07.790 --> 04:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
um and then the third part is uh is the
 
04:31:09.710 --> 04:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
study and uh you can look at the
 
04:31:12.290 --> 04:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
language of that again I won't
 
04:31:14.090 --> 04:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
bother you right now with going through
 
04:31:16.429 --> 04:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
that it's easy easy to read but it
 
04:31:19.610 --> 04:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
basically is trying to see if there
 
04:31:21.050 --> 04:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
isn't a way that we could be more
 
04:31:24.050 --> 04:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
helpful to tenants and of course their
 
04:31:27.550 --> 04:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
landlords uh in uh
 
04:31:31.010 --> 04:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
in a way that would be helpful to
 
04:31:34.550 --> 04:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
to everybody and maybe to our affordable
 
04:31:36.429 --> 04:31:36.439 align:start position:0%
housing problem
 
04:31:39.410 --> 04:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
so I think I I'll leave it at that I
 
04:31:41.450 --> 04:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
tried to rush through a pretty
 
04:31:44.210 --> 04:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
complicated Bill and I'm sorry for that
 
04:31:46.309 --> 04:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
but all the information is here
 
04:31:48.050 --> 04:31:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you that was a great high level
 
04:31:49.729 --> 04:31:49.739 align:start position:0%
overview and obviously there's a lot to
 
04:31:51.469 --> 04:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
read here so we will do that but would
 
04:31:53.210 --> 04:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
you entertain questions right now
 
04:31:55.849 --> 04:31:55.859 align:start position:0%
excellent representative Platt first one
 
04:31:57.889 --> 04:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
I have and I'll take my turn for future
 
04:32:01.309 --> 04:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
once is thank you for taking the
 
04:32:04.729 --> 04:32:04.739 align:start position:0%
question if the state is required to
 
04:32:06.710 --> 04:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
provide a hundred percent of an adequate
 
04:32:06.720 --> 04:32:08.090 align:start position:0%
provide a hundred percent of an adequate
education

04:32:08.090 --> 04:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
and you're taking three percent off
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
leaving 97 are we not only are we then
 
04:32:16.130 --> 04:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
only paying 97 percent of an adequate
 
04:32:16.140 --> 04:32:19.250 align:start position:0%
only paying 97 percent of an adequate
education

04:32:19.250 --> 04:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:20.929 --> 04:32:20.939 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question the the
 
04:32:24.830 --> 04:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh we're not subtracting at all from the
 
04:32:26.990 --> 04:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
grant adequate education grant the
 
04:32:30.050 --> 04:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
community will get its full Grant and
 
04:32:32.450 --> 04:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
they'll be paid by the state from funds
 
04:32:35.630 --> 04:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
that include swept funds and all also
 
04:32:38.450 --> 04:32:38.460 align:start position:0%
the many other sources of funds that the
 
04:32:38.460 --> 04:32:39.649 align:start position:0%
the many other sources of funds that the
state

04:32:39.649 --> 04:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:32:43.070 --> 04:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
um turns to when it uh when it
 
04:32:45.229 --> 04:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
determines what revenue is available to
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
pay for an adequate education so the
 
04:32:49.070 --> 04:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
same formula would apply the same
 
04:32:51.530 --> 04:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
calculation would be made they'd get the
 
04:32:55.070 --> 04:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
same amount and I have to add that it's
 
04:33:00.170 --> 04:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:03.649 --> 04:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
okay representative jinnegan
 
04:33:05.209 --> 04:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:33:06.769 --> 04:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:33:09.769 --> 04:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
um the part that deals with um low and
 
04:33:12.051 --> 04:33:12.061 align:start position:0%
moderate income tax
 
04:33:14.570 --> 04:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
um not income tax law and monitors uh
 
04:33:17.810 --> 04:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
income it's a mouthful
 
04:33:17.820 --> 04:33:21.349 align:start position:0%
income it's a mouthful
um

04:33:21.349 --> 04:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:24.230 --> 04:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
what actually now
 
04:33:26.330 --> 04:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
um not throwing myself off
 
04:33:26.340 --> 04:33:27.109 align:start position:0%
um not throwing myself off
um

04:33:27.109 --> 04:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:30.109 --> 04:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
oh who is who would audit that I mean is
 
04:33:31.970 --> 04:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
it each town to be responsible for
 
04:33:35.150 --> 04:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
figuring out if the person qualifies or
 
04:33:36.051 --> 04:33:36.061 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
down to the state level that's a good
 
04:33:39.949 --> 04:33:39.959 align:start position:0%
good question the administration of the
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
low and moderate income tax program is
 
04:33:46.029 --> 04:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
is uh the responsibility of the
 
04:33:49.131 --> 04:33:49.141 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration so
 
04:33:51.410 --> 04:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
it's such centralized there and I'm not
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
sure what auditing has happened over the
 
04:33:53.279 --> 04:33:55.250 align:start position:0%
sure what auditing has happened over the
years

04:33:55.250 --> 04:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:33:58.609 --> 04:33:58.619 align:start position:0%
folks we do have another pink card uh
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
for another individual plus we have dra
 
04:34:03.410 --> 04:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
here to answer more technical questions
 
04:34:07.070 --> 04:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative Ames
 
04:34:08.689 --> 04:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
we'll be seeing you around so what
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
representative horse
 
04:34:12.769 --> 04:34:12.779 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for taking my
 
04:34:17.150 --> 04:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you uh so is this an
 
04:34:19.789 --> 04:34:19.799 align:start position:0%
additional tax on the property tax if
 
04:34:23.209 --> 04:34:23.219 align:start position:0%
people are paying now
 
04:34:26.631 --> 04:34:26.641 align:start position:0%
it's an existing tax
 
04:34:30.310 --> 04:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
um been around since uh
 
04:34:34.310 --> 04:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
2001 or so at a higher level at six
 
04:34:36.170 --> 04:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
dollars and sixty cents per thousand
 
04:34:36.180 --> 04:34:37.070 align:start position:0%
dollars and sixty cents per thousand
then

04:34:37.070 --> 04:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:34:40.730 --> 04:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
it's now with this funny way of
 
04:34:43.310 --> 04:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
determining the rate it's about a dollar
 
04:34:45.789 --> 04:34:45.799 align:start position:0%
40 or so
 
04:34:50.269 --> 04:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
and it shows up on a your bill anybody's
 
04:34:52.250 --> 04:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
bill that has a pro has property it
 
04:34:54.529 --> 04:34:54.539 align:start position:0%
shows up as one of the four
 
04:34:57.650 --> 04:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
uh components of the property tax you've
 
04:35:01.789 --> 04:35:01.799 align:start position:0%
got the county the municipal the
 
04:35:04.490 --> 04:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
local education and then the swept the
 
04:35:06.730 --> 04:35:06.740 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax
 
04:35:10.369 --> 04:35:10.379 align:start position:0%
so it's it's it's not new
 
04:35:12.230 --> 04:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
04:35:14.269 --> 04:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up question please
 
04:35:15.949 --> 04:35:15.959 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:35:19.070 --> 04:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
so I went through this with uh former
 
04:35:21.529 --> 04:35:21.539 align:start position:0%
rep Doug Hall who you might know I know
 
04:35:24.289 --> 04:35:24.299 align:start position:0%
him well okay very good and I have a lot
 
04:35:27.949 --> 04:35:27.959 align:start position:0%
of respect for the man uh I just if I
 
04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
understood the way this was originally
 
04:35:31.970 --> 04:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
set up
 
04:35:34.369 --> 04:35:34.379 align:start position:0%
certain towns that were
 
04:35:36.289 --> 04:35:36.299 align:start position:0%
much richer than say where I'm at
 
04:35:38.631 --> 04:35:38.641 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield Chichester area
 
04:35:40.609 --> 04:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
I thought that money was supposed to be
 
04:35:42.349 --> 04:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
collected and shared amongst the other
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
towns to help spread the uh the burden
 
04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know to help out
 
04:35:50.209 --> 04:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
the towns that don't have the numbers
 
04:35:51.949 --> 04:35:51.959 align:start position:0%
such as
 
04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield I think they're only
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
graduating 20 some students so student
 
04:35:58.609 --> 04:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
numbers are going down but the the cost
 
04:36:00.349 --> 04:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
of fund the schools are going up and I
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
thought this was supposed to help level
 
04:36:06.349 --> 04:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
the playing field am I wrong yeah
 
04:36:09.410 --> 04:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I I do know about Pittsfield that's
 
04:36:12.949 --> 04:36:12.959 align:start position:0%
one of the towns that struggles most uh
 
04:36:15.349 --> 04:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
because of uh low property values
 
04:36:15.359 --> 04:36:17.150 align:start position:0%
because of uh low property values
overall

04:36:17.150 --> 04:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
overall
 
04:36:17.160 --> 04:36:17.929 align:start position:0%
overall
um

04:36:17.929 --> 04:36:17.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:20.390 --> 04:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:36:23.631 --> 04:36:23.641 align:start position:0%
I think there are two separate
 
04:36:26.230 --> 04:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
parts to this
 
04:36:28.609 --> 04:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
picture that we're trying to paint and
 
04:36:30.051 --> 04:36:30.061 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:36:34.429 --> 04:36:34.439 align:start position:0%
um there is the sources of revenue swept
 
04:36:36.410 --> 04:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
is just a source of Revenue it's nothing
 
04:36:39.349 --> 04:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
more than that it goes into well right
 
04:36:41.510 --> 04:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
now it doesn't go up to the state pot
 
04:36:43.849 --> 04:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
it's kept locally and it's subtracted
 
04:36:46.849 --> 04:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
out of the state's obligation so it's
 
04:36:48.890 --> 04:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
applied against the state's obligation
 
04:36:52.429 --> 04:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
locally but it's just a revenue Source
 
04:36:54.230 --> 04:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's applied against that as I've
 
04:36:56.090 --> 04:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
pointed out there's a problem because in
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
some places like Rye or
 
04:37:02.631 --> 04:37:02.641 align:start position:0%
um we were just looking at what's the
 
04:37:04.090 --> 04:37:04.100 align:start position:0%
name of the town
 
04:37:04.100 --> 04:37:06.010 align:start position:0%
name of the town
Alden

04:37:06.010 --> 04:37:06.020 align:start position:0%
Alden
 
04:37:09.949 --> 04:37:09.959 align:start position:0%
or moultonborough and they're collecting
 
04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
much more vocally than is needed and
 
04:37:16.551 --> 04:37:16.561 align:start position:0%
they're being allowed to keep it right
 
04:37:19.970 --> 04:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
now and that I say should be in the in
 
04:37:23.689 --> 04:37:23.699 align:start position:0%
the state pot for distribution out so
 
04:37:25.551 --> 04:37:25.561 align:start position:0%
that's one thing the sources of revenue
 
04:37:28.189 --> 04:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
and this bill is mostly about sources of
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
revenue uh the other part is the
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
adequate education program the the
 
04:37:37.551 --> 04:37:37.561 align:start position:0%
program that's designed to spread money
 
04:37:39.650 --> 04:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
out so that
 
04:37:39.660 --> 04:37:40.849 align:start position:0%
out so that
um

04:37:40.849 --> 04:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:44.330 --> 04:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
places with greater need will get more I
 
04:37:46.730 --> 04:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
think that's what you're talking about
 
04:37:51.051 --> 04:37:51.061 align:start position:0%
and that is the adequate education
 
04:37:53.150 --> 04:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
program is funded out of the education
 
04:37:56.209 --> 04:37:56.219 align:start position:0%
trust fund into which this money would
 
04:37:59.289 --> 04:37:59.299 align:start position:0%
pour as well as other sources of money
 
04:38:03.670 --> 04:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
and that program right now
 
04:38:07.390 --> 04:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
provides roughly on uh across the state
 
04:38:11.750 --> 04:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
about five thousand dollars per pupil
 
04:38:15.289 --> 04:38:15.299 align:start position:0%
um it varies because some places have
 
04:38:19.189 --> 04:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
more uh needy kids than others and
 
04:38:21.230 --> 04:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
there's some variation based on needy
 
04:38:21.240 --> 04:38:22.029 align:start position:0%
there's some variation based on needy
kids

04:38:22.029 --> 04:38:22.039 align:start position:0%
kids
 
04:38:26.810 --> 04:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
but that five thousand dollar Norm is is
 
04:38:29.209 --> 04:38:29.219 align:start position:0%
way below what school districts are
 
04:38:31.490 --> 04:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
spending or need to spend Pittsfield in
 
04:38:33.230 --> 04:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
particular probably needs to spend more
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
because they've got kids that need a
 
04:38:38.510 --> 04:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
little more attention and so anyway it's
 
04:38:41.330 --> 04:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
a complicated story The the sufficiency
 
04:38:43.369 --> 04:38:43.379 align:start position:0%
of adequacy but that's that's the other
 
04:38:45.650 --> 04:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
problem I think that's when you started
 
04:38:48.349 --> 04:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
your question with okay uh follow-up
 
04:38:48.359 --> 04:38:49.609 align:start position:0%
your question with okay uh follow-up
question

04:38:49.609 --> 04:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:38:54.051 --> 04:38:54.061 align:start position:0%
one more okay thank you madam chair so I
 
04:38:56.689 --> 04:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
understood that when I talked with
 
04:39:00.890 --> 04:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
former rat Paul that uh this this tax
 
04:39:02.810 --> 04:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
was going to be as I said spread around
 
04:39:06.890 --> 04:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
now was it the Senate that put a kibosh
 
04:39:09.949 --> 04:39:09.959 align:start position:0%
on that in 2011 from what I understand
 
04:39:12.410 --> 04:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
and there's currently a move to get that
 
04:39:14.570 --> 04:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
fixed yeah
 
04:39:18.349 --> 04:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
um 2000 up until it's a little unclear
 
04:39:22.810 --> 04:39:22.820 align:start position:0%
to me but up until definitely as of 2011
 
04:39:26.570 --> 04:39:26.580 align:start position:0%
uh the statutory law was changed to
 
04:39:29.810 --> 04:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
explicitly allow at least this is my
 
04:39:31.490 --> 04:39:31.500 align:start position:0%
reading of it
 
04:39:34.310 --> 04:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
um retention at the local level of all
 
04:39:36.709 --> 04:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
swept proceeds
 
04:39:40.850 --> 04:39:40.860 align:start position:0%
um and uh before that uh there certainly
 
04:39:42.650 --> 04:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
was a period of time when the sweat
 
04:39:46.250 --> 04:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
proceeds went to the state and went into
 
04:39:48.650 --> 04:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
that pot and then were distributed out
 
04:39:53.150 --> 04:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
Doug Hall is is helping in the lawsuit
 
04:39:56.390 --> 04:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned that's pending the the
 
04:40:00.430 --> 04:40:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh the Iran the New Hampshire lawsuit
 
04:40:05.150 --> 04:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
and that lawsuit directly challenges
 
04:40:09.130 --> 04:40:09.140 align:start position:0%
this swept excess swept retention system
 
04:40:12.110 --> 04:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
and seeks to I think there's a summary
 
04:40:15.490 --> 04:40:15.500 align:start position:0%
judgment motion that's now in play
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
that is being litigated with the state
 
04:40:20.810 --> 04:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire on the defensive side
 
04:40:20.820 --> 04:40:22.850 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire on the defensive side
opposing

04:40:22.850 --> 04:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
opposing
 
04:40:26.090 --> 04:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
the motion to declare the current swept
 
04:40:28.368 --> 04:40:28.378 align:start position:0%
system unconstitutional and that's
 
04:40:30.650 --> 04:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
before its Superior Court judge
 
04:40:33.110 --> 04:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:40:34.910 --> 04:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
so I guess like what begs the question
 
04:40:37.070 --> 04:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
is this premature to do something like
 
04:40:39.110 --> 04:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
this if this is in the courts actively
 
04:40:40.330 --> 04:40:40.340 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:40:44.330 --> 04:40:44.340 align:start position:0%
you know my answer to that is uh yeah
 
04:40:47.690 --> 04:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
maybe but uh there are many instances
 
04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
where the legislature has felt that the
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
right thing to do was to go this way or
 
04:40:57.948 --> 04:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
that way and there were tensions or
 
04:41:00.830 --> 04:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
arguments over that which way was the
 
04:41:03.890 --> 04:41:03.900 align:start position:0%
more constitutional so we could we could
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
make a judgment to go ahead there's
 
04:41:09.350 --> 04:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
nothing to stop us and I at this stage I
 
04:41:11.330 --> 04:41:11.340 align:start position:0%
favor that just because it's taken taken
 
04:41:14.270 --> 04:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
so long to get these you'll you'll see
 
04:41:17.390 --> 04:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
in my uh report and that's my report the
 
04:41:19.190 --> 04:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
the committee's report
 
04:41:22.128 --> 04:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
at the end of last year a reference to
 
04:41:25.750 --> 04:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
this case that I've been mentioning Rand
 
04:41:29.030 --> 04:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
yeah Rand V State of New Hampshire
 
04:41:32.090 --> 04:41:32.100 align:start position:0%
um it was pending then uh back in
 
04:41:36.350 --> 04:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
November and now here we are and uh now
 
04:41:38.810 --> 04:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
there's another another motion and you
 
04:41:40.670 --> 04:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
know it'll go on eventually it'll come
 
04:41:42.470 --> 04:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
out but you're right
 
04:41:45.708 --> 04:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
um the uh we could wait we could retain
 
04:41:48.110 --> 04:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
this and wait
 
04:41:51.288 --> 04:41:51.298 align:start position:0%
um I'd prefer to see it go ahead and get
 
04:41:54.910 --> 04:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
these uh this this more uh
 
04:41:58.010 --> 04:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh substantial amount of relief program
 
04:42:01.128 --> 04:42:01.138 align:start position:0%
in place so I think there's a reason to
 
04:42:04.430 --> 04:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:06.410 --> 04:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis hi thank you
 
04:42:08.448 --> 04:42:08.458 align:start position:0%
ma'am chair I have a question about the
 
04:42:11.150 --> 04:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
second part about the low and moderate
 
04:42:14.090 --> 04:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
income property tax relief program yeah
 
04:42:14.100 --> 04:42:14.690 align:start position:0%
income property tax relief program yeah
yeah

04:42:14.690 --> 04:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:42:14.700 --> 04:42:16.010 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

04:42:16.010 --> 04:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:20.090 --> 04:42:20.100 align:start position:0%
the do you have and and even a ballpark
 
04:42:25.128 --> 04:42:25.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:27.650 --> 04:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question there's a uh
 
04:42:30.410 --> 04:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
there's a cap in in the Bill of 30
 
04:42:33.530 --> 04:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars and if the cost of the
 
04:42:37.128 --> 04:42:37.138 align:start position:0%
program exceeds 30 million dollars it
 
04:42:40.448 --> 04:42:40.458 align:start position:0%
will be uh proportionally the the
 
04:42:43.628 --> 04:42:43.638 align:start position:0%
refunds will be proportionally reduced
 
04:42:46.970 --> 04:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:50.570 --> 04:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative leapley
 
04:42:53.448 --> 04:42:53.458 align:start position:0%
um I had a question I understand the
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
three percent
 
04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
um being retained
 
04:43:00.190 --> 04:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
basically because there's a cost for the
 
04:43:03.770 --> 04:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
municipalities to collect this tax I was
 
04:43:07.730 --> 04:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
wondering why it makes sense for them to
 
04:43:09.288 --> 04:43:09.298 align:start position:0%
collect the tax rather than having the
 
04:43:16.090 --> 04:43:16.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:19.610 --> 04:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
it's a part of what municipalities do
 
04:43:22.850 --> 04:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
right now they they value put value on
 
04:43:25.730 --> 04:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
property they uh they've got you know
 
04:43:28.550 --> 04:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
they've got a system in place so I think
 
04:43:30.650 --> 04:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
the the framers of this bill in the
 
04:43:32.510 --> 04:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
first place back at the beginning of
 
04:43:34.510 --> 04:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
2000 um
 
04:43:38.510 --> 04:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
thought that they needed to assign the
 
04:43:41.270 --> 04:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
task to the municipalities at that time
 
04:43:44.470 --> 04:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
they didn't think to reimburse the
 
04:43:47.628 --> 04:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities for their efforts but uh
 
04:43:50.090 --> 04:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
I think that's appropriate and I should
 
04:43:52.128 --> 04:43:52.138 align:start position:0%
add that the three percent the three
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
percent is uh parallel to what's allowed
 
04:43:57.470 --> 04:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
right now in the rooms and meals tax for
 
04:44:01.730 --> 04:44:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh restaurants hotels and so forth to
 
04:44:05.090 --> 04:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
retain before sending in uh the proceeds
 
04:44:09.788 --> 04:44:09.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:12.410 --> 04:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative almond
 
04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you there's some stuff I'd like to
 
04:44:20.650 --> 04:44:20.660 align:start position:0%
love to say but can't uh on it was 1999
 
04:44:24.288 --> 04:44:24.298 align:start position:0%
but we I've got here and I gave to
 
04:44:26.448 --> 04:44:26.458 align:start position:0%
everybody loan moderate income
 
04:44:29.030 --> 04:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
homeowners property tax relief the
 
04:44:31.788 --> 04:44:31.798 align:start position:0%
historic claims data
 
04:44:34.850 --> 04:44:34.860 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it starts at 2010 it would
 
04:44:37.788 --> 04:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
be more revealing if it started in 2000
 
04:44:41.090 --> 04:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
or 2001 whenever we started the thing is
 
04:44:44.650 --> 04:44:44.660 align:start position:0%
there a question but on what I wanted to
 
04:44:50.510 --> 04:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
ask you was the claims have gone down
 
04:44:52.970 --> 04:44:52.980 align:start position:0%
regularly ever since that program
 
04:44:57.948 --> 04:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
started in 2010 there were 12 000 claims
 
04:45:02.650 --> 04:45:02.660 align:start position:0%
granted for 2.3 million total and by
 
04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
2021 there were 5 800 claim claims
 
04:45:11.390 --> 04:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
granted for 1.4 million and
 
04:45:11.400 --> 04:45:13.850 align:start position:0%
granted for 1.4 million and
on

04:45:13.850 --> 04:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:45:17.150 --> 04:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
the part of the problem seems to be that
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
the forums are complicated uh the people
 
04:45:23.330 --> 04:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
who would qualify for enough money to
 
04:45:26.868 --> 04:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
make it worthwhile are uh not good at
 
04:45:29.030 --> 04:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
complicated forms
 
04:45:29.040 --> 04:45:30.470 align:start position:0%
complicated forms
and

04:45:30.470 --> 04:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:30.480 --> 04:45:31.730 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:45:31.730 --> 04:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
do you have have you looked at at how to
 
04:45:38.288 --> 04:45:38.298 align:start position:0%
make that
 
04:45:42.650 --> 04:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
that on claims process
 
04:45:45.170 --> 04:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
work better
 
04:45:49.490 --> 04:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
so that this one would work
 
04:45:49.500 --> 04:45:51.110 align:start position:0%
so that this one would work
well

04:45:51.110 --> 04:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:45:54.530 --> 04:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
the page that you're looking at is from
 
04:45:58.970 --> 04:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
the dra and uh as the administrators of
 
04:46:03.110 --> 04:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
this this program they may be able to
 
04:46:05.628 --> 04:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
speak to this I agree
 
04:46:09.550 --> 04:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
um that it's complicated and difficult
 
04:46:13.390 --> 04:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:16.490 --> 04:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
that is of concern I think that part of
 
04:46:19.070 --> 04:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
it is that you don't get much under the
 
04:46:20.708 --> 04:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
existing program
 
04:46:23.628 --> 04:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
and so there's not much incentive to go
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
through the effort it will be different
 
04:46:29.868 --> 04:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
under this uh this new program it'll be
 
04:46:32.690 --> 04:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
more worthwhile so I think we'll see a
 
04:46:36.110 --> 04:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
change there I think if I remember
 
04:46:38.330 --> 04:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
remember correctly that the committee
 
04:46:40.368 --> 04:46:40.378 align:start position:0%
that we're setting up is also going to
 
04:46:42.830 --> 04:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
be looking at the issue and and the
 
04:46:48.190 --> 04:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
three percent retention is explicitly uh
 
04:46:52.250 --> 04:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
allowed to enable municipalities to
 
04:46:56.330 --> 04:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
reach out to homeowners so there's that
 
04:46:57.770 --> 04:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
element as well
 
04:47:01.430 --> 04:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:03.470 --> 04:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
04:47:06.410 --> 04:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
okay we have a pink card from Zen I
 
04:47:10.430 --> 04:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
don't know what this stands for NHS f f
 
04:47:12.890 --> 04:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
p so please explain what that is come on
 
04:47:12.900 --> 04:47:20.868 align:start position:0%
p so please explain what that is come on
up

04:47:20.868 --> 04:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:29.930 --> 04:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:31.788 --> 04:47:31.798 align:start position:0%
yes we're the the only organization with
 
04:47:33.650 --> 04:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
a long acronym
 
04:47:36.350 --> 04:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
um my name is Zach Sheehan I am the
 
04:47:37.730 --> 04:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
Project Director of the New Hampshire
 
04:47:40.430 --> 04:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
school funding fairness project I have
 
04:47:41.810 --> 04:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
copies of my written testimony coming
 
04:47:44.270 --> 04:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
around that uh clearly identify that as
 
04:47:44.280 --> 04:47:45.530 align:start position:0%
around that uh clearly identify that as
well

04:47:45.530 --> 04:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:47:48.110 --> 04:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
um I
 
04:47:50.208 --> 04:47:50.218 align:start position:0%
we'll go through some pieces of my
 
04:47:51.830 --> 04:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
written of my testimony but you all have
 
04:47:53.570 --> 04:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
copies now and so I don't want to
 
04:47:55.368 --> 04:47:55.378 align:start position:0%
reiterate everything you have and I did
 
04:47:57.708 --> 04:47:57.718 align:start position:0%
want to actually expand upon a few of
 
04:48:00.410 --> 04:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
the questions committee members
 
04:48:02.150 --> 04:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
yeah it's coming making its way around
 
04:48:04.070 --> 04:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
and I also wanted to expand upon a few
 
04:48:05.208 --> 04:48:05.218 align:start position:0%
questions that committee members were
 
04:48:05.218 --> 04:48:06.110 align:start position:0%
questions that committee members were
asking

04:48:06.110 --> 04:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
asking
 
04:48:08.868 --> 04:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
um as well uh so first off thanks for
 
04:48:10.430 --> 04:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
having me here this afternoon
 
04:48:12.948 --> 04:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate being able to testify
 
04:48:15.410 --> 04:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
um to start off we are in support of
 
04:48:17.868 --> 04:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
House Bill 569 uh specifically because
 
04:48:20.110 --> 04:48:20.120 align:start position:0%
it would make New Hampshire's tax system
 
04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
significantly fairer in our view
 
04:48:23.760 --> 04:48:25.910 align:start position:0%
significantly fairer in our view
um

04:48:25.910 --> 04:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:28.010 --> 04:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
there aren't enough
 
04:48:30.590 --> 04:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
all right I can grab some more uh past
 
04:48:32.930 --> 04:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
20 copies around but I can and the clerk
 
04:48:36.530 --> 04:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
needs to retain two all right I will
 
04:48:40.970 --> 04:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:40.980 --> 04:48:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:48:41.750 --> 04:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:44.390 --> 04:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
so to start off uh just um some
 
04:48:46.610 --> 04:48:46.620 align:start position:0%
background on why as an organization we
 
04:48:48.410 --> 04:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
support this measure and also supported
 
04:48:52.010 --> 04:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
House Bill 504 from last session
 
04:48:54.350 --> 04:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
um specifically the property taxes uh
 
04:48:55.850 --> 04:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
the largest tax collected in New
 
04:48:57.590 --> 04:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire generating over four billion
 
04:48:59.690 --> 04:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
dollars to support state and local
 
04:49:02.628 --> 04:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
public services just in 2022 it's
 
04:49:04.550 --> 04:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
significantly more than any other form
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
of Taxation levited in the state which I
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
know this committee is intimately
 
04:49:10.670 --> 04:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:12.350 --> 04:49:12.360 align:start position:0%
um yet the property tax continues to be
 
04:49:14.810 --> 04:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
an unfair tax as it places far greater
 
04:49:16.670 --> 04:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility on those low and moderate
 
04:49:18.470 --> 04:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
income taxpayers than it does on more
 
04:49:20.750 --> 04:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
affluent ones according to data from The
 
04:49:22.310 --> 04:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
Institute on Taxation and economic
 
04:49:24.530 --> 04:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
policy the 20 of New Hampshire
 
04:49:26.930 --> 04:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
households are the lowest incomes
 
04:49:29.628 --> 04:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
uh paid 6.2 percent of their incomes and
 
04:49:32.810 --> 04:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
property taxes in 2018. uh compared with
 
04:49:35.030 --> 04:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
the wealthiest one percent of households
 
04:49:37.128 --> 04:49:37.138 align:start position:0%
in the state who only paid about 1.9
 
04:49:39.830 --> 04:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
percent of their incomes
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
and despite the heavy Reliance on that
 
04:49:43.330 --> 04:49:43.340 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
04:49:45.590 --> 04:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
it our low and moderate income property
 
04:49:48.288 --> 04:49:48.298 align:start position:0%
tax relief program does not provide very
 
04:49:50.350 --> 04:49:50.360 align:start position:0%
much relief to our citizens
 
04:49:52.310 --> 04:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
representative Alma you asked about
 
04:49:55.010 --> 04:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
starting data earlier on I did cite in
 
04:49:57.708 --> 04:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
2003 the program provided roughly 7.5
 
04:49:59.448 --> 04:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
million dollars in property tax relief
 
04:50:02.030 --> 04:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
to over 27 000 Granite Staters as
 
04:50:06.110 --> 04:50:06.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to in 2021 only 1.4 million
 
04:50:08.390 --> 04:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
dollars in relief and yet I don't think
 
04:50:11.510 --> 04:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
property taxes have gone down uh in the
 
04:50:14.090 --> 04:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
past 19 years it's actually quite the
 
04:50:14.100 --> 04:50:15.650 align:start position:0%
past 19 years it's actually quite the
opposite

04:50:15.650 --> 04:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
opposite
 
04:50:18.230 --> 04:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
um so in addition to uh significantly
 
04:50:20.650 --> 04:50:20.660 align:start position:0%
increasing both the number of homeowners
 
04:50:23.090 --> 04:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
and the value of the rebates they would
 
04:50:25.970 --> 04:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
receive it would raise the income
 
04:50:27.890 --> 04:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
threshold for the program which hasn't
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
been adjusted since uh Inception about
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:35.930 --> 04:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
um it would also uh
 
04:50:35.940 --> 04:50:37.610 align:start position:0%
um it would also uh
tie

04:50:37.610 --> 04:50:37.620 align:start position:0%
tie
 
04:50:39.830 --> 04:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
parameters would be adjusted for changes
 
04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
in the Consumer Price Index which is
 
04:50:43.670 --> 04:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
important just so that inflation doesn't
 
04:50:46.310 --> 04:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
continue to erode the benefit of those
 
04:50:48.470 --> 04:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
rebates which as a canoe is just talking
 
04:50:50.868 --> 04:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
about might be a reason why some people
 
04:50:53.628 --> 04:50:53.638 align:start position:0%
don't find it worth applying as the
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
amount goes down and the relative relief
 
04:50:58.910 --> 04:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
that they would get from those rebates
 
04:51:01.550 --> 04:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'd also advances taxpayer Equity uh in
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
another crucial way as it would end the
 
04:51:04.670 --> 04:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
preferential treatment that some
 
04:51:06.288 --> 04:51:06.298 align:start position:0%
property wealthy communities now enjoy
 
04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
under the Statewide education property
 
04:51:08.400 --> 04:51:10.128 align:start position:0%
under the Statewide education property
tax

04:51:10.128 --> 04:51:10.138 align:start position:0%
tax
 
04:51:11.810 --> 04:51:11.820 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to answer more
 
04:51:14.150 --> 04:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
questions about that as well under the
 
04:51:15.650 --> 04:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution it's the duty
 
04:51:17.150 --> 04:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
of the state to provide an adequate
 
04:51:19.010 --> 04:51:19.020 align:start position:0%
education to every child regardless of
 
04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
where they may live
 
04:51:21.948 --> 04:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
um going back to the Supreme Court
 
04:51:24.170 --> 04:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
rulings from the 90s and the Claremont 2
 
04:51:26.628 --> 04:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
to the extent that the property taxes
 
04:51:28.970 --> 04:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
used in the future to fund the provision
 
04:51:31.250 --> 04:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education the attacks
 
04:51:32.868 --> 04:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
must be administered in a manner that is
 
04:51:34.970 --> 04:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
equal in valuation and uniform and rate
 
04:51:36.830 --> 04:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
04:51:36.840 --> 04:51:38.150 align:start position:0%
across the state
and

04:51:38.150 --> 04:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:41.030 --> 04:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
currently it's swept as far from uniform
 
04:51:43.010 --> 04:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
as representative Ames is just going
 
04:51:46.010 --> 04:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
over some communities with higher
 
04:51:48.050 --> 04:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
property value it recognized as
 
04:51:50.030 --> 04:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
communities with excess swept are
 
04:51:52.250 --> 04:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
allowed to retain that excess revenue
 
04:51:54.948 --> 04:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
and levied against their other taxes to
 
04:51:56.690 --> 04:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
reduce them resulting in some towns
 
04:51:58.490 --> 04:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
actually have negative local education
 
04:52:00.590 --> 04:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
property tax rates of other communities
 
04:52:02.750 --> 04:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
like Pittsfield that was being mentioned
 
04:52:07.550 --> 04:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
are far from negative property tax rates
 
04:52:10.670 --> 04:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
additionally there's another lawsuit
 
04:52:13.670 --> 04:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
that was also mentioned that has been
 
04:52:16.250 --> 04:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
moving right along in that lawsuit
 
04:52:17.750 --> 04:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
there's been a couple motions there's a
 
04:52:20.208 --> 04:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
pending summary judgment motion uh that
 
04:52:21.708 --> 04:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
I think the state's response is due back
 
04:52:23.628 --> 04:52:23.638 align:start position:0%
on Monday
 
04:52:26.390 --> 04:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
um asking the the state to the judge to
 
04:52:29.390 --> 04:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
order the state to stop this process of
 
04:52:32.690 --> 04:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
collecting swept in this way to date the
 
04:52:33.830 --> 04:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
state has never defended the
 
04:52:35.868 --> 04:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of swept they've
 
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
simply highlighted the logistical
 
04:52:40.010 --> 04:52:40.020 align:start position:0%
challenges of changing that in the
 
04:52:41.930 --> 04:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
middle of a tax year which is when this
 
04:52:45.288 --> 04:52:45.298 align:start position:0%
was last being heard last fall
 
04:52:47.868 --> 04:52:47.878 align:start position:0%
the point there being representative um
 
04:52:50.390 --> 04:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
relatives representative sanborn's uh
 
04:52:53.270 --> 04:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
question uh that I don't think it would
 
04:52:56.030 --> 04:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
be premature to act on this given that
 
04:52:58.128 --> 04:52:58.138 align:start position:0%
you know to date no one has kind of
 
04:53:00.350 --> 04:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
pushed back on the constitutionality of
 
04:53:02.930 --> 04:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
swept and there might be a ruling you
 
04:53:04.550 --> 04:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
know as early as in the next couple
 
04:53:06.410 --> 04:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
weeks and so kind of moving forward in
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
this process I think would would give
 
04:53:09.650 --> 04:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
the committee the legislature a jump
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
I'll end um by
 
04:53:23.930 --> 04:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
pointing out that
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
this bill also takes into consideration
 
04:53:28.368 --> 04:53:28.378 align:start position:0%
two key findings from the commission to
 
04:53:30.708 --> 04:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
study school funding that met throughout
 
04:53:33.288 --> 04:53:33.298 align:start position:0%
the year 2020
 
04:53:35.448 --> 04:53:35.458 align:start position:0%
they examined the New Hampshire's school
 
04:53:37.250 --> 04:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
property tax system in length in part
 
04:53:39.948 --> 04:53:39.958 align:start position:0%
because it's connected so deeply to how
 
04:53:42.890 --> 04:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
we fund an adequate education in the
 
04:53:42.900 --> 04:53:43.910 align:start position:0%
we fund an adequate education in the
state

04:53:43.910 --> 04:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:53:45.830 --> 04:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
and the two recommendations they made
 
04:53:47.090 --> 04:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
the first is that the state should
 
04:53:49.310 --> 04:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
eliminate the excess swept Grant and
 
04:53:50.810 --> 04:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
such excess funds should be applied
 
04:53:52.970 --> 04:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
through the reform distribution formula
 
04:53:54.890 --> 04:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
to improve student and taxpayer Equity
 
04:53:56.930 --> 04:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
there should be no blanket rebates
 
04:53:59.330 --> 04:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
abatements refunds or grants of swept
 
04:54:01.490 --> 04:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
back to municipalities
 
04:54:03.350 --> 04:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
another part went on to state that the
 
04:54:04.788 --> 04:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
state should enhance taxpayer Equity
 
04:54:06.890 --> 04:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
through property tax relief targeted to
 
04:54:08.810 --> 04:54:08.820 align:start position:0%
homeowners and renters through a low and
 
04:54:10.190 --> 04:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
moderate income property tax relief
 
04:54:11.868 --> 04:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
program this program should include
 
04:54:13.910 --> 04:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
updated limits to income home value net
 
04:54:15.890 --> 04:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
worth and we satisfactorily funded
 
04:54:17.750 --> 04:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the state we believe that
 
04:54:20.208 --> 04:54:20.218 align:start position:0%
house bill 569 starts to address some of
 
04:54:24.110 --> 04:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
those provisions and we absolutely urge
 
04:54:25.788 --> 04:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
the members to vote ought to pass and
 
04:54:27.948 --> 04:54:27.958 align:start position:0%
I'd be more than happy to answer any
 
04:54:32.880 --> 04:54:32.890 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:32.890 --> 04:54:34.490 align:start position:0%

04:54:34.490 --> 04:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:54:37.010 --> 04:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
are you aware that they're already that
 
04:54:39.650 --> 04:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
there was an update to the low and
 
04:54:41.930 --> 04:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
moderate income property tax relief
 
04:54:44.930 --> 04:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
program it was effective for this past
 
04:54:47.030 --> 04:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
tax year and people got rebates that
 
04:54:48.650 --> 04:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
were more than double what they had been
 
04:54:48.660 --> 04:54:49.910 align:start position:0%
were more than double what they had been
before

04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:54:54.590 --> 04:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:54.600 --> 04:55:01.368 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:55:01.368 --> 04:55:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:04.190 --> 04:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
know that when
 
04:55:08.690 --> 04:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
the legislature was hit with a superior
 
04:55:13.970 --> 04:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
court decision on back in 2000 and
 
04:55:18.788 --> 04:55:18.798 align:start position:0%
year 2000 I think that declared that the
 
04:55:21.010 --> 04:55:21.020 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax was
 
04:55:23.990 --> 04:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional that at least the
 
04:55:26.510 --> 04:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
legislature if not the court took that
 
04:55:29.410 --> 04:55:29.420 align:start position:0%
to imply that we also had
 
04:55:32.708 --> 04:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional County taxes and
 
04:55:36.288 --> 04:55:36.298 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional on school Cooperative
 
04:55:41.110 --> 04:55:41.120 align:start position:0%
School District taxes that were at risk
 
04:55:44.990 --> 04:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
I was not aware that that Court ruling
 
04:55:47.030 --> 04:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
meant those things I did know that
 
04:55:50.628 --> 04:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
courts and decisions in the past had
 
04:55:52.490 --> 04:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
um said that the swept was
 
04:55:54.770 --> 04:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and then also multiple
 
04:55:56.868 --> 04:55:56.878 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court rulings have said that how
 
04:55:58.310 --> 04:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
we fund education which is the other
 
04:56:00.410 --> 04:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
half of the equation has been
 
04:56:02.030 --> 04:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and has not been
 
04:56:04.730 --> 04:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
changed to date
 
04:56:07.788 --> 04:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
thank you but it does that gravitas to
 
04:56:07.798 --> 04:56:09.650 align:start position:0%
thank you but it does that gravitas to
that

04:56:09.650 --> 04:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:56:12.708 --> 04:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
questions on this side
 
04:56:14.270 --> 04:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
04:56:16.970 --> 04:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for having me
 
04:56:20.208 --> 04:56:20.218 align:start position:0%
okay we also have dra here again to help
 
04:56:22.070 --> 04:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
us understand all the moving Parts here
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
a little bit better
 
04:56:56.570 --> 04:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:58.368 --> 04:56:58.378 align:start position:0%
Mr Wong before you get started
 
04:56:59.930 --> 04:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative fellow just mentioned
 
04:57:02.570 --> 04:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
something that made me think
 
04:57:05.510 --> 04:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
um she said that property tax refunds
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
were double recently and I'm just
 
04:57:08.270 --> 04:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
wondering did we do something
 
04:57:10.970 --> 04:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
legislatively recently Madam chair the
 
04:57:12.650 --> 04:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
reason I know that is because it was my
 
04:57:16.490 --> 04:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
bill that did it yeah and and so what
 
04:57:18.890 --> 04:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
was the bill number do you remember or I
 
04:57:20.810 --> 04:57:20.820 align:start position:0%
don't remember the number but it it
 
04:57:20.820 --> 04:57:22.550 align:start position:0%
don't remember the number but it it
passed

04:57:22.550 --> 04:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
passed
 
04:57:24.410 --> 04:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
no I don't even remember it didn't pass
 
04:57:27.050 --> 04:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
not in 22 it would have passed in 2021
 
04:57:31.190 --> 04:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
yep because it was effective for
 
04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
um May through June as the application
 
04:57:38.090 --> 04:57:38.100 align:start position:0%
period last year and it was the first
 
04:57:41.150 --> 04:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
time it had been updated in in 20 years
 
04:57:43.970 --> 04:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
but the numbers you see when you look at
 
04:57:43.980 --> 04:57:45.110 align:start position:0%
but the numbers you see when you look at
the

04:57:45.110 --> 04:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:57:45.120 --> 04:57:46.490 align:start position:0%
the
um

04:57:46.490 --> 04:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:48.470 --> 04:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
um representative Ames Bill are the new
 
04:57:51.288 --> 04:57:51.298 align:start position:0%
numbers they used to be much lower than
 
04:57:53.448 --> 04:57:53.458 align:start position:0%
that so we recently made some progress
 
04:57:55.850 --> 04:57:55.860 align:start position:0%
in that region and and just to since
 
04:57:58.010 --> 04:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
we're just talking on the subject I have
 
04:58:00.170 --> 04:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
a bill that has already been heard in
 
04:58:03.650 --> 04:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County to make people
 
04:58:07.190 --> 04:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
aware of the program because one of the
 
04:58:11.750 --> 04:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
reasons the the the return was so low
 
04:58:15.410 --> 04:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
that over the past 20 years there are
 
04:58:18.110 --> 04:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
fewer and fewer people fell below the
 
04:58:21.530 --> 04:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
the income cap so some people dropped
 
04:58:23.990 --> 04:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
out of the program and and then the
 
04:58:26.990 --> 04:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
payouts were so low that it just didn't
 
04:58:28.788 --> 04:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
make sense when you can only get some
 
04:58:30.470 --> 04:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
people can only get 20 percent of that
 
04:58:33.470 --> 04:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
so this past time around the maximum
 
04:58:35.830 --> 04:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
that a person could get would be about
 
04:58:37.970 --> 04:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
350 dollars
 
04:58:41.030 --> 04:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
and before that it was down you know we
 
04:58:42.830 --> 04:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
were heading toward like a hundred
 
04:58:45.890 --> 04:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
dollars or under okay thank you for that
 
04:58:49.010 --> 04:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead and let us know your
 
04:58:50.270 --> 04:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
thoughts thank you
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Kim Ming Wong
 
04:58:54.530 --> 04:58:54.540 align:start position:0%
text policy Council from uh from the dra
 
04:58:56.930 --> 04:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
the dra does not have a position on this
 
04:58:59.930 --> 04:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
bill we did prepare a fiscal note and I
 
04:59:01.550 --> 04:59:01.560 align:start position:0%
just handed out the physical quick guide
 
04:59:03.590 --> 04:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
04:59:05.868 --> 04:59:05.878 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here to answer any questions
 
04:59:08.510 --> 04:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh but just as a fair warning I
 
04:59:11.628 --> 04:59:11.638 align:start position:0%
personally am not very familiar with
 
04:59:15.890 --> 04:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
with the municipal uh side of the dra so
 
04:59:17.690 --> 04:59:17.700 align:start position:0%
um I might be taking more questions down
 
04:59:20.090 --> 04:59:20.100 align:start position:0%
in having to go back to the office to
 
04:59:24.110 --> 04:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:25.670 --> 04:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
I have a quick question because I've
 
04:59:29.030 --> 04:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
seen caps on programs like this uh with
 
04:59:30.890 --> 04:59:30.900 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:59:32.990 --> 04:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
what was that all right research and
 
04:59:34.970 --> 04:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
development tax credit and when we put a
 
04:59:36.890 --> 04:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
cap on it it created this strange
 
04:59:38.990 --> 04:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
situation where you'd have to wait for a
 
04:59:41.030 --> 04:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
while to see if you got the relief yes
 
04:59:42.948 --> 04:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts on that for this
 
04:59:45.530 --> 04:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
bill right uh representative so that
 
04:59:47.628 --> 04:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
that will be true because there's the
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
cap on a payout for this particular Bill
 
04:59:53.390 --> 04:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
per fiscal year is kept at 30 million
 
04:59:56.270 --> 04:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
dollars and the uh the applications that
 
04:59:59.510 --> 04:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
come in use is coming in from May 1st
 
05:00:01.910 --> 05:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
through I can't remember the exact date
 
05:00:05.390 --> 05:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
where it stops so whenever the current
 
05:00:08.330 --> 05:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
process is that when the dra receives
 
05:00:10.550 --> 05:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
the application we will review it and
 
05:00:12.948 --> 05:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
process it and pay out if it's approved
 
05:00:16.190 --> 05:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
everything meets uh everything is in
 
05:00:19.310 --> 05:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
order the payment will be made and uh
 
05:00:21.650 --> 05:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
with this 30 million dollar cap that
 
05:00:23.690 --> 05:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
payout would that the relief payment
 
05:00:28.368 --> 05:00:28.378 align:start position:0%
would be uh hold up until we receive the
 
05:00:28.378 --> 05:00:29.350 align:start position:0%
would be uh hold up until we receive the
last

05:00:29.350 --> 05:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:00:31.670 --> 05:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
application for that particular year
 
05:00:34.250 --> 05:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
otherwise we'll never know if we meet a
 
05:00:40.670 --> 05:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:45.350 --> 05:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:45.360 --> 05:00:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:00:46.310 --> 05:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:48.470 --> 05:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
Under The Proposal
 
05:00:53.270 --> 05:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
the swept tax money would be sent from
 
05:00:56.448 --> 05:00:56.458 align:start position:0%
the municipalities to dra
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
what is your interpretation of of that
 
05:01:04.070 --> 05:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism because we know that not all
 
05:01:06.708 --> 05:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
people pay their property tax bills on
 
05:01:09.948 --> 05:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
time do you anticipate that the
 
05:01:12.410 --> 05:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
municipalities will send you the whole
 
05:01:13.550 --> 05:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
amount even though they haven't
 
05:01:15.610 --> 05:01:15.620 align:start position:0%
collected it or
 
05:01:18.128 --> 05:01:18.138 align:start position:0%
water and then you have delayed
 
05:01:20.750 --> 05:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
collections yes that could be a
 
05:01:22.788 --> 05:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
potential issue representative
 
05:01:25.550 --> 05:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
because this will be a new system so uh
 
05:01:28.010 --> 05:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
the dra this currently does not have a
 
05:01:30.830 --> 05:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism in place to do this if this
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass then we will have to
 
05:01:35.330 --> 05:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
set up the system to implement uh the
 
05:01:36.830 --> 05:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
collections of these monies from the
 
05:01:39.288 --> 05:01:39.298 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the way how it will
 
05:01:41.150 --> 05:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
look probably as is you say that's
 
05:01:42.830 --> 05:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
something that we probably will need to
 
05:01:44.810 --> 05:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
to look into further as we start to
 
05:01:46.490 --> 05:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
implement or start to design the system
 
05:01:49.610 --> 05:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
is to how do we actually mechanically
 
05:01:52.430 --> 05:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
collect this monies and what as you say
 
05:01:54.590 --> 05:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
what happens when there are um the
 
05:01:57.170 --> 05:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
payments I'm going to assume that the
 
05:01:58.788 --> 05:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
municipalities will not
 
05:02:01.270 --> 05:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
pay on behalf of
 
05:02:03.490 --> 05:02:03.500 align:start position:0%
property owners
 
05:02:06.708 --> 05:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
so if they are late they will be late on
 
05:02:08.510 --> 05:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
that end and it'll be late coming in as
 
05:02:08.520 --> 05:02:11.410 align:start position:0%
that end and it'll be late coming in as
well

05:02:11.410 --> 05:02:11.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:13.990 --> 05:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative homie
 
05:02:16.430 --> 05:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:02:20.510 --> 05:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
did you realize that the towns have to
 
05:02:24.128 --> 05:02:24.138 align:start position:0%
pay the counties whether
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
they've gotten all of their own tax
 
05:02:30.288 --> 05:02:30.298 align:start position:0%
money in or not at the time when the
 
05:02:32.390 --> 05:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
counties have to be paid
 
05:02:36.890 --> 05:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:38.930 --> 05:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
talk with someone from the municipal
 
05:02:43.310 --> 05:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:45.230 --> 05:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative Shamrock
 
05:02:47.628 --> 05:02:47.638 align:start position:0%
I think representative spilsbury was
 
05:02:47.638 --> 05:02:49.610 align:start position:0%
I think representative spilsbury was
first

05:02:49.610 --> 05:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:02:51.350 --> 05:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
he's to your left man I realize you
 
05:02:56.990 --> 05:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:59.570 --> 05:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
go ahead Mr Sandberg we'll go for you
 
05:03:01.310 --> 05:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
and then we'll come over here I have a
 
05:03:03.050 --> 05:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
clerk here who's very diligently
 
05:03:06.610 --> 05:03:06.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:09.770 --> 05:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh on your
 
05:03:09.780 --> 05:03:11.690 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh on your
analysis

05:03:11.690 --> 05:03:11.700 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
05:03:16.010 --> 05:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:18.230 --> 05:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned two errors
 
05:03:22.490 --> 05:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
oh yes is this something that right can
 
05:03:24.350 --> 05:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
be addressed with an amendment to the
 
05:03:26.628 --> 05:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
the bill so um
 
05:03:28.970 --> 05:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
from when we were looking at the uh the
 
05:03:31.070 --> 05:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
bill or
 
05:03:34.610 --> 05:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
um all the LSR uh the the issue that we
 
05:03:37.190 --> 05:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
found uh potential I don't think it's on
 
05:03:39.230 --> 05:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
a calculation error on our end but it
 
05:03:43.070 --> 05:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
can be double checked but the uh the the
 
05:03:46.610 --> 05:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
the two thousand dollar uh increment in
 
05:03:50.810 --> 05:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
terms of uh the percentage of the payout
 
05:03:54.708 --> 05:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
um it caps out to zero before the
 
05:03:57.708 --> 05:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
maximum amount that's on the uh the bill
 
05:03:57.718 --> 05:03:59.270 align:start position:0%
maximum amount that's on the uh the bill
so

05:03:59.270 --> 05:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:01.128 --> 05:04:01.138 align:start position:0%
um that could be something to be looked
 
05:04:02.930 --> 05:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
into again
 
05:04:06.288 --> 05:04:06.298 align:start position:0%
for both the single as well as head of
 
05:04:06.298 --> 05:04:08.810 align:start position:0%
for both the single as well as head of
household

05:04:08.810 --> 05:04:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:11.628 --> 05:04:11.638 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury
 
05:04:14.890 --> 05:04:14.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:21.610 --> 05:04:21.620 align:start position:0%
so in regards to the low income credits
 
05:04:23.810 --> 05:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
there's both an increase in the
 
05:04:23.820 --> 05:04:25.310 align:start position:0%
there's both an increase in the
thresholds

05:04:25.310 --> 05:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
thresholds
 
05:04:28.550 --> 05:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
which represents uh
 
05:04:31.550 --> 05:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
one source of reduced Revenue
 
05:04:33.470 --> 05:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
to the state that the state has to make
 
05:04:36.890 --> 05:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
up from other funds but there's also the
 
05:04:39.350 --> 05:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
change that uh
 
05:04:42.590 --> 05:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
makes this applicable to the entire real
 
05:04:45.530 --> 05:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
estate tax bill and not merely the swept
 
05:04:48.890 --> 05:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
portion as the dra taken those two
 
05:04:50.930 --> 05:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
different factors separately into
 
05:04:56.270 --> 05:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:56.280 --> 05:04:59.208 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:04:59.208 --> 05:04:59.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:01.970 --> 05:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
so the the change in the thresholds on
 
05:05:03.830 --> 05:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
the one hand and the change in
 
05:05:06.288 --> 05:05:06.298 align:start position:0%
eligibility to be expanded to the entire
 
05:05:07.670 --> 05:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
real estate bill
 
05:05:10.730 --> 05:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
because of the the cap of the 30 million
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
dollars so that would be the maximum um
 
05:05:19.850 --> 05:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:22.788 --> 05:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
I think my question shows that I'm still
 
05:05:24.830 --> 05:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
confused on exactly how that would work
 
05:05:27.170 --> 05:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
so admissions
 
05:05:30.970 --> 05:05:30.980 align:start position:0%
um but I haven't completely
 
05:05:35.770 --> 05:05:35.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:40.910 --> 05:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
where the impact of the credit lies in
 
05:05:44.090 --> 05:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
the case of the swept I believe it's
 
05:05:47.090 --> 05:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
clear that the state makes up
 
05:05:49.070 --> 05:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
the difference for whatever credits have
 
05:05:51.050 --> 05:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
been granted to individuals
 
05:05:53.150 --> 05:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
but with regard to the broader real
 
05:06:08.390 --> 05:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:11.330 --> 05:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
any other questions right now
 
05:06:13.670 --> 05:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much for coming
 
05:06:16.190 --> 05:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
are there any more folks who want to
 
05:06:19.070 --> 05:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill
 
05:06:20.690 --> 05:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will close a public
 
05:06:26.750 --> 05:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:29.868 --> 05:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
okay I think that means we are done for
 
05:06:34.250 --> 05:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:39.530 --> 05:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh and then we will meet again next
 
05:06:43.610 --> 05:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
Tuesday or I think we're going to be
 
05:06:45.708 --> 05:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
doing Revenue Agency presentations again
 
05:06:53.230 --> 05:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:53.240 --> 05:06:56.948 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:06:56.948 --> 05:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:59.090 --> 05:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
yeah so we're going to start sprinkling
 
05:07:01.550 --> 05:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
back in the agency presentations
 
05:07:03.350 --> 05:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh and then of course we'll wait to see
 
05:07:04.670 --> 05:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
what the governor has to say on
 
05:07:07.550 --> 05:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:09.288 --> 05:07:09.298 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I will see you soon
 
05:07:11.330 --> 05:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
and uh Republicans will schedule a
 
05:07:13.850 --> 05:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
caucus probably uh next Tuesday after
 
05:07:21.970 --> 05:07:21.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:24.948 --> 05:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
say that again
 
05:07:27.708 --> 05:07:27.718 align:start position:0%

05:07:33.830 --> 05:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
