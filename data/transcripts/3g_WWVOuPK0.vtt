00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:27.310 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
we will open the committee of conference
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
1593 I'd like to
 
00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
begin with a memory the very first bill
 
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
that I ever introduced in the Senate
 
00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley was on the committee and
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
I wasn't prepared for his first question
 
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
which was tell us the process by which
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
the bill came before the Senate and I
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
thought Senator Bradley is a smart guy
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
and pretty experienced and he doesn't
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
know the process so I asked him to
 
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
clarify and he said no what happened in
 
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:51.320 align:start position:0%
the policy committee what was the vote
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
then what happened on the house floor
 
00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
was it a consent bill or not and I saw
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
then thank you the value of getting that
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
on the record I would like to ask the
 
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
same question with this proposal how it
 
00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
today much uh Mr chair I guess
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
turnaround is fair play right I've
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
waited years for it thank
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
you all right so
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
um is a long story but I'll try to make
 
00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
it as brief as possible the existing met
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
dish settlement between the hospitals in
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire expires at
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
the end of this fiscal year so there was
 
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
always need for legislation
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
so several of us um in the Senate
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
started early on maybe in November or
 
00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
December I think the three of us um
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
having discussions about
 
00:27:54.029 --> 00:27:54.039 align:start position:0%
it um in January Governor sonunu
 
00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:57.519 align:start position:0%
suggested that um it really should run
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
through the attorney General's office we
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
agreed and we waited
 
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
for um that process
 
00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
to um unfold it took a little bit longer
 
00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
than I think any of us had anticipated I
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
had hoped to be able to file a l bill um
 
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
in the Senate but there was no agreement
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
so we decided after the you know time
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
was getting nigh in late February to
 
00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519 align:start position:0%
violate Bill to propose an amendment to
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
a house bill have a public hearing and
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
um bring it to the house hoping that
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
there was going to be a settlement
 
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
between the Attorney General's office
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
and the hospital Association so I think
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of people work diligently
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
certainly the governor did Henry Lipman
 
00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
the State Medicaid director did the
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
hospital Association Steve Onan did uh
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office did and I
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
think agreed on basic parameters but not
 
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
all parameters and so it went to a
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
public hearing um in the
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
Senate and we adopted an amendment that
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
you see before you is the Senate passed
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
version of the bill so that's what's
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
happen happens um had we
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to file a late bill
 
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
with something ready to go um you folks
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
in the house would have had the
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a public hearing it
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
just unfortunately because these are
 
00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.430 align:start position:0%
just unfortunately because these are
complicated

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
issues um it's been subject the Met tax
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
has been subject to litigation in the
 
00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:55.519 align:start position:0%
past the state has lost that litigation
 
00:29:59.950 --> 00:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
and you know I'm happy to provide the
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
2014 Superior Court decision one two
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
three four five I think Jess already had
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
it I gave it to him I if if this is the
 
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
only copy I can uh no no no I I have
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
other copies I think I gave one to Erica
 
00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:20.519 align:start position:0%
too okay so thank you um there's been a
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
litigation on this in the past and if I
 
00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:26.519 align:start position:0%
can try in the simplest terms to
 
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.080 align:start position:0%
summarize the litigation
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
um the Medicaid enhancement tax is
 
00:30:36.909 --> 00:30:36.919 align:start position:0%
levied on net patient revenue of
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
hospitals so that includes both
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
outpatient and inpatient
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
Services the reason the tax which raises
 
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
about $320 million of revenue for the
 
00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire has been found
 
00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional is that identical
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
services that are offered by other
 
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
providers similar to hospitals but not
 
00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
hospitals for instance could be an
 
00:31:06.269 --> 00:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery Center it could be um
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
Physical Therapy it could be any number
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
of other exact identical Services is not
 
00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:16.039 align:start position:0%
subject to um the Medicaid enhancement
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
tax so I think the
 
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.230 align:start position:0%
tax so I think the
conclusion

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
of the court in
 
00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:26.519 align:start position:0%
2014 was that the tax was
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional so my my understanding
 
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
is there have been two settlements that
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
the state has entered into and the
 
00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
latest settlement which um returns 91%
 
00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
of the generated Revenue back to the
 
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals for distribution to the 26
 
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.470 align:start position:0%
hospitals for distribution to the 26
Hospital

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
members that settlement expires
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
in a month or less and so the need for
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and again that's the process
 
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
apologies to our friends in the house
 
00:32:04.269 --> 00:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
that you haven't had a chance to really
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
vet this as well as we have although we
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
also didn't have a lot of time to vet it
 
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
but this amendment this bill um with the
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Amendment did have a public
 
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
committee representative Edwards uh
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and and thank you for
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
that uh summary Senator I'm I'm glad
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
that I've had the opportunity to talk
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
with you and others about this bill in
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
the last 72 hours and what I what I
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
think I I I I I see fairly clearly the
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
complicating issue for the House
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
Representatives here is that that this
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
could be the greatest bill ever and it
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
never saw a single meeting or
 
00:32:57.310 --> 00:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
conversation amongst house members and
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
and so the the effective request of this
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference is to get four
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
out of 400 house members to agree to the
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
good work of the Senate and that's a
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
huge responsibility if we were to accept
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
it um and as I've slept on it a couple
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
of nights I think where I've come to to
 
00:33:25.389 --> 00:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
to to fall is
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
that for us for us 1centers to speak for
 
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.269 align:start position:0%
that for us for us 1centers to speak for
the

00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
400 I think what we need to do is to
 
00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:36.919 align:start position:0%
make sure that what we're doing is
 
00:33:39.549 --> 00:33:39.559 align:start position:0%
really right and vital And
 
00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
Timely uh be conf confident in what we
 
00:33:46.509 --> 00:33:46.519 align:start position:0%
do and also to be as minimalistic as we
 
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
can so that we don't overrun our you
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
know lean over our skis too far and take
 
00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
on more than what we should I think I
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
think we need to be conservative in this
 
00:34:02.269 --> 00:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference about what the
 
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
house position can be because we haven't
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
had a proper opportunity to develop a
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
house position and and I know all the
 
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
good work you've done with all the
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
people I know how difficult this is I
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
really respect that whole process of
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
yours but um but I'm just letting you
 
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
know that I you know although I I'm
 
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
generally in support of of the need to
 
00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
do this I I'm I just want to I
 
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
personally will be wanting to be
 
00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
cautious about how much we take
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
on and and I totally appreciate it and
 
00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879 align:start position:0%
it's really nobody's fault um that we
 
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
are here
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
on June 6 at the deadline of Committee
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
of conference this is complicated it's
 
00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
contentious it's been subject to
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
litigation a lot of money is at stake um
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
the viability of hospitals is at stake
 
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
the impact on the general fund um and
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire for revenues
 
00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
is at stake and at the end of the day
 
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
our health care System I think is at
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
stake and so um I couldn't agree with
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
you more representative Edwards that it
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
would have been
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
um helpful had we had more time to vet
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
this I
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
totally understand it so if I could Mr
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
chair um maybe walk through the
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
amendment and try to hit the the
 
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
so I'm assuming because the house does
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
such a great job of side by sides that
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
there are side by
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
sides okay well I'll I'll do my best
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
then I'll be bouncing back and forth
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
between the amendment and and the
 
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.510 align:start position:0%
between the amendment and and the
um

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
um underlying Senate bills so
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
the first part of the bill is the
 
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
underlying bill so really the hospital
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
piece starts on page two line 8 where um
 
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
there's a definition of hospitals and
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
Hospital Medicaid payments that's
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
section two and three okay so
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding that's
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
recreating um language that was in a
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
previous settlement so really no change
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
is my understanding and Henry can
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong on that but
 
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding so in the Senate
 
00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
version in order to mitigate the impact
 
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.309 align:start position:0%
version in order to mitigate the impact
on

00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals um we moved the 91% which is
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
the current rate of dollars flowing back
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
to the hospital from the Met tax um to
 
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
93% but um that was deemed unacceptable
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
to you know all the parties that or at
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
least some of the parties that worked
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
all winter and spring on it so the first
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
change in the amendment is to go back to
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
91% so if you're looking at the
 
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
amendment it's on line five if you're
 
00:37:29.069 --> 00:37:29.079 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill it's line 29 so 91
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
becomes 93 and so just think of it this
 
00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
way that um every 1% of $300 million is
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
about $3 million okay so it it reverts
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
$6 million back to um the
 
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
state one of the things that is being
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
proposed here both in the bill and I
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
think this is important so if you go to
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
the bill on page two on the bottom of
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
page two there is language that gives
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the Department of
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services the authority
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
to determine method or methods used to
 
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
make Medicaid payments subject to um
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement and obviously it
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
has to be approved by the center for
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and Medicare
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
Services um but the Hope in doing this
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
is to move away from the current
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
structure into what's known as more
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
directed payments by going to directed
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
payments we take advantage of the 9010
 
00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
match um under Medicaid expansion and
 
00:38:46.109 --> 00:38:46.119 align:start position:0%
that increases Revenue um for the state
 
00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:50.680 align:start position:0%
okay but when you do that there are
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals that are in different places
 
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
in terms
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
of their cost structure so whether it's
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
the Acuity level of patients whether
 
00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.109 align:start position:0%
the Acuity level of patients whether
it's

00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
um the uncompensated care level of
 
00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
patients the number of patients that
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
have insurance all of those things
 
00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.069 align:start position:0%
have insurance all of those things
factor

00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
factor
 
00:39:12.079 --> 00:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
factor
into

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:13.090 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:14.710 align:start position:0%
into
[Music]

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
um that 91% going back so it fluctuates
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
from year to year the point of allowing
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
this language now is to take advantage
 
00:39:28.589 --> 00:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
of better reimburse ment rates which
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
means a win-win for the state and um
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
mitigating the impact of 91% on
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals because remember they pay a
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
tax but they get 91% back and it's
 
00:39:46.829 --> 00:39:46.839 align:start position:0%
allocated amongst the hospitals the 91%
 
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
based on this patient mix and Acuity
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
level so that is kind of outlined in
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
page two section three and it gives oh
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry I've gotten ahead of myself
 
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
no one has the amendment I have them
 
00:40:02.359 --> 00:40:04.430 align:start position:0%
no one has the amendment I have them
here

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere thought they had been provided
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.990 align:start position:0%
 
apologies

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
apologies
 
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
so then moving on to page three it
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
outlines sort of the bottom of page two
 
00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
and Page Three what the parameters of
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
how this Authority is given to the
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner and this is pretty
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
important in determining which method to
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
utilize the commissioner shall seek to
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
prevent to the greatest extent
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
possible year-over-year Hospital
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursement reductions in the
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
aggregate while at the same time
 
00:40:59.550 --> 00:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
achieving the highest available Federal
 
00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
match so that's the goal of everything
 
00:41:09.069 --> 00:41:09.079 align:start position:0%
that is trying to be done okay so then
 
00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
the rest of Page Three is largely
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
boilerplate that
 
00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
um is consistent with the existing
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
settlement with the hospitals okay so
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
then moving on to page four the next big
 
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.230 align:start position:0%
then moving on to page four the next big
chain

00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
chain
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
amendment is that we move
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
from um 7% which is line 20 of the bill
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
to 9% which is line 14 of the amendment
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
and that gets back to the 91% so
 
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
9% then gets funneled into other health
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
care services
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
okay so that is consistent with the
 
00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:01.720 align:start position:0%
position that you know the Attorney
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
General's office took as to what the um
 
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
ultimate disposition of the settlement
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
should look
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
like next change is and this is the
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
critical change that I hope that we can
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
buy into but I'm not suggesting that the
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office or the
 
00:42:25.549 --> 00:42:25.559 align:start position:0%
governor's office is fully supportive
 
00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:28.559 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
top of page five in the bill versus um
 
00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.870 align:start position:0%
top of page five in the bill versus um
lines

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
23 on the amendment section 13 and 14 so
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
there would be a directed payment of $57
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
million of State funds to mitigate the
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
losses that the hospitals will
 
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
experience some hospitals are going to
 
00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:56.200 align:start position:0%
do better than today based on their
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
patient mix but some won't and that's
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
just a factor of trying to maximize
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
state revenue and move away from the
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
dish portion of how we've distributed
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
this Revenue which by the way is a CMS
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
and federal requirement at this point to
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
be moving away so we get the advantage
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
of more revenue and we're more in
 
00:43:25.549 --> 00:43:25.559 align:start position:0%
compliance with um Federal
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
rules so we make this $
 
00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:31.589 align:start position:0%
rules so we make this $
5.72

00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
5.72
 
00:43:34.829 --> 00:43:34.839 align:start position:0%
million payment that is matched by I
 
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
believe it's $8.6
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
million to of federal funds to create a
 
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.549 align:start position:0%
million to of federal funds to create a
$4.3

00:43:43.549 --> 00:43:43.559 align:start position:0%
$4.3
 
00:43:43.559 --> 00:43:45.430 align:start position:0%
$4.3
million

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
um additional help if you will for the
 
00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
hospitals to mitigate against the red
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
ink that many of them will experience
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
without that $14.3 million there still
 
00:43:59.790 --> 00:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
and I believe this spreadsheet has been
 
00:44:03.309 --> 00:44:03.319 align:start position:0%
shared with folks but if not we'll make
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
sure it
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
is um even after this $14.3
 
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
million there are still several
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals that um will be in the red
 
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.150 align:start position:0%
hospitals that um will be in the red
Visa

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
Visa
 
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:24.440 align:start position:0%
their um payment from previous years to
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
what's anticipated in future years now
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
these are all subject to audit and
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
change from year to year again depending
 
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
on your patient Acuity but the hospitals
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
while they're not thrilled about this
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
have have agreed that this is um
 
00:44:45.309 --> 00:44:45.319 align:start position:0%
something that they can accept and live
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
with even despite the fact that six
 
00:44:52.549 --> 00:44:52.559 align:start position:0%
hospitals um have red
 
00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
ink the generated net revenue is anticip
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
at and this is the last thing on the
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
amendment it's the statement of intent
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
on line four that as a result of all of
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
this the state will net $22 million of
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
um new Revenue both $
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
million of Medicaid enhancement tax
 
00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
revenue which then gets matched so well
 
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
no one's happy with this certainly the
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
hospitals aren't certainly I think the
 
00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
folks that negotiated this are not it's
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
still I think a rational way to proceed
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
because and this and then I'll stop
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
after this Mr chair I think if you look
 
00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
at and I believe I passed out the
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
2014 court case it's pretty clear to me
 
00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
when I read this
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
that the Met tax has been held to be
 
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.030 align:start position:0%
that the Met tax has been held to be
unconstitutional

00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
because it applies the same taxes
 
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply excuse me the same tax for
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
exact same Services it does apply to
 
00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals it doesn't apply to other
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
service providers and as such has been
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
ruled unconstitutional so in the
 
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:19.640 align:start position:0%
absence of an agreement or acquiescence
 
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
on the part of the hospitals to pay the
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
tax there's likely to be
 
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
litigation what is the impact of
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
litigation I think no one
 
00:46:32.549 --> 00:46:32.559 align:start position:0%
knows and
 
00:46:35.589 --> 00:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
um I would say I I'm certainly not going
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
to be here next year but most of you
 
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:42.559 align:start position:0%
will and if there's litigation that puts
 
00:46:42.559 --> 00:46:44.109 align:start position:0%
will and if there's litigation that puts
into

00:46:44.109 --> 00:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
doubt um $320 is Million Dollar of
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
general fund Revenue to the state I
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
would argue that that's
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
um not a good way to proceed which for
 
00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.230 align:start position:0%
um not a good way to proceed which for
the

00:46:59.230 --> 00:46:59.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
relatively small cost of $ 5.72 million
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
matched by $8.6 million of federal
 
00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
proceed representative
 
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
stram uh thank you for all that um
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
representing I guess the house side and
 
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
following uh on both your comments and U
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Edwards uh you know kind of
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
our experience um with the hospitals as
 
00:47:34.109 --> 00:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
part of the budget uh process uh was
 
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
pretty positive we were brought brought
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
forward u a certain fixed amount of
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
money to deal with Medicaid rate
 
00:47:44.109 --> 00:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
increases and uh we're we're challenged
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
with the uh exercise of Prior
 
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
prioritizing uh Services over another uh
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
in a way that might uh improve the
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
overall effectiveness of the Health Care
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
System uh the hospital Association uh uh
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
kicked us off by saying you know what
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
don't give us
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
anything uh we have problems with
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
patients being stuck in emergency rooms
 
00:48:08.549 --> 00:48:08.559 align:start position:0%
and and in the hospitals and we can't
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
get them out if you can prioritize in
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
the money in a way that gets uh provides
 
00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:17.079 align:start position:0%
places for uh those people to go you're
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
going to help us and it's going to help
 
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:22.760 align:start position:0%
the whole system and uh uh that really
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh started the ball rolling for us in in
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
what was part of the What's called the
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
miracle budget and uh in prioritizing
 
00:48:35.309 --> 00:48:35.319 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and at home care uh and uh
 
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.160 align:start position:0%
really taking a look at every every one
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
of the um uh Medicaid uh programs uh and
 
00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
even with the final 40 million that uh
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
came available in the last 24 hours
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
before before the budget uh passed with
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
a gavel in the house there was still no
 
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
money for the hospitals so um uh and you
 
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
know not having experience
 
00:48:59.349 --> 00:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
um you know with this particular
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment here uh you know we come in
 
00:49:04.589 --> 00:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
with a mindset that uh uh that that the
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh hospitals uh uh Representatives here
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
are uh if they're if they're asking uh
 
00:49:14.109 --> 00:49:14.119 align:start position:0%
for for funds and and change in way to
 
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
do things that uh we're going to listen
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
very very hard based on the experience
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
that we had uh in this two years uh and
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of your uh
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
presentation of the amendment
 
00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:31.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know seeing the uh previous 93%
 
00:49:33.069 --> 00:49:33.079 align:start position:0%
being brought down to
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
91% uh the uh uh the emphasis on um
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
services that uh would be eligible for
 
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
the 9010 uh Federal match instead of a
 
00:49:50.109 --> 00:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
50/50 match and uh a relatively um uh
 
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
you not insignificant but one that
 
00:49:54.789 --> 00:49:54.799 align:start position:0%
multiplies uh additional appropriation
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
from the general funds um
 
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
I'm very very inclined to uh support
 
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment um as as you um presented
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
it here but I'm also eager to hear from
 
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
those who have spent more time uh on the
 
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
the met and the dish payments as well
 
00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.109 align:start position:0%
the met and the dish payments as well
thanks

00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you very much Mr
 
00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
chairman um I have been serving on
 
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
finance committee through both prior
 
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.309 align:start position:0%
finance committee through both prior
settlements

00:50:27.309 --> 00:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
settlements
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
and um I guess I should say that we
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
can't just if we don't go forward with
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
this we can't just extend the life of
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
the settlement that's running out in
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
three weeks because the federal rules
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
around dish payments have changed so
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
that's really not an option for us and I
 
00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
think the Constitution
 
00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.470 align:start position:0%
think the Constitution
ality

00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
ality
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
is is a real thing we changed the
 
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
statute to fix the Constitutional
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
problem back I think either in 2016 or
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
18 and at that time maybe it was 18 the
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals acknowledged that the statute
 
00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.630 align:start position:0%
hospitals acknowledged that the statute
was

00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional so it got us out of
 
00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
ongoing expensive with
 
00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:31.160 align:start position:0%
litigation and um I think that that
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
helpful representive Edwards uh thank
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I I just want to in
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
introduce the handout that came out
 
00:51:47.069 --> 00:51:47.079 align:start position:0%
while uh while they're speaking taking
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
place um this I I I thought of this when
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
I heard Senator Bradley mentioned how
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
good the LBA is at doing side by sides
 
00:51:58.829 --> 00:51:58.839 align:start position:0%
and so so uh I had asked the division 3
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
LBA to put together a side by side of
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
the current law versus what the Senate
 
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
proposal was because you know coming new
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
to this what the Viewpoint I needed was
 
00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
to see what what are what our current
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
law is and what are we proposing to do
 
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
to change it and I I'm bringing this to
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
you way too late in the process and it
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
may not have any practical use but um
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
but I I did did want to make it
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
available to just let um Senator Bradley
 
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
know that there was some effort by the
 
00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
LBA to do a side by
 
00:52:38.109 --> 00:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
side and and I should have distributed
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
it sooner that that that's on me
 
00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
representative L um thank you Mr
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
chairman as somebody not on house
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
finance I have uh put on my scho big
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
year and delve deep into these numbers
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
to understand them but numbers are
 
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
something I have some experience with um
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand how the
 
00:53:00.789 --> 00:53:00.799 align:start position:0%
91% plus um these additional funds
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
really translate because if we look at
 
00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.030 align:start position:0%
really translate because if we look at
the

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
5.72% that's approximately another 2%
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
but I'm trying to understand how we are
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
able to have the
 
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
143 million additional and how we can
 
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
sort of compare apples and oranges on
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
that because I don't quite understand
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
applying the state portion of the Met um
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
versus applying the Met plus some of the
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
Federal match to this I'm just trying to
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
make sure that I fully understand what
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
it is that we're trying to consider here
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
funds not at
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:53.240 align:start position:0%
position good morning for the record
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
Henry Litman the state's Medicaid
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
director um thank you for the question
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um
 
00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
the the 91% of the Medicaid enhancement
 
00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
tax comes in and as uh Senator Bradley
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
talked about that that um the the
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
current law if you will and the proposal
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
sort of do the same thing in the sense
 
00:54:22.589 --> 00:54:22.599 align:start position:0%
that um we look to maximize what the
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
state will have for money to work with
 
00:54:28.789 --> 00:54:28.799 align:start position:0%
and to to um provide relief to the
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals for the
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
uncompensated um care and um other costs
 
00:54:36.190 --> 00:54:36.200 align:start position:0%
that they incur and serving the program
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
um the um the 5.72 million um that is
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
additional um funds that um otherwise
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
would just be used in the the state
 
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
program if you will um on the state side
 
00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
and because
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
the multiplier on the federal match if
 
00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
you kind of think about it kind of
 
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:03.799 align:start position:0%
Simply if if it were 6 million under the
 
00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
normal match it would just be we'd get
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
12 million out of it and because there's
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
an enhanced match available under the
 
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
directed payments we're able to um get
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:22.109 --> 00:55:22.119 align:start position:0%
14.3 uh okay um that's helpful so
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
generally that means that um on the rest
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
of the match on the others that that's
 
00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:28.839 align:start position:0%
what's supporting our other areas of
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
Medical Care such as um these ones where
 
00:55:34.109 --> 00:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
we're discharging people um I'm just I'm
 
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
trying to understand why I should look
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
at this as 91.5 point7 looking at it as
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
a total of uh 20 uh 296 million and not
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
look at it as closer to 305 million
 
00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
which is the amount that's being
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
distributed within within um the
 
00:55:53.069 --> 00:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
handouts that we have here I mean I
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
think that the amount of money that gets
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
paid out would be the the
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
29.4 plus the 14.3 to the hospitals but
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
in terms of what it costs the state in
 
00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
terms of funds that it is putting into
 
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
5.72 representative
 
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh thank you uh Mr chair um M Mr
 
00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
Litman this this may not be the
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate question for you so if if
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
the the Senate wanted to respond that
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
that's fine with me um the the 5.72
 
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
Million number I've been thinking about
 
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
that wondering how we came to
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
5.72 and it strikes me that we have
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
essentially a we're all in violent
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
agreement that 91% of the Met tax that
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
comes in should be redistributed
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
appropriately to balance out the
 
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals uh and that left the 9% to to
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
be um reprogrammed and it it strikes me
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
that 5.72 gets close to being 2% of the
 
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
total met tax and it just makes me
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
wonder if this five if this
 
00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
5.72 isn't really just another way to
 
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
rename it to bring us back to
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
93% and if that's the if that's what
 
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
happened then I don't think that's I I I
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
don't perceive that to be acceptable to
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
at all so so I I'm just curious about
 
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
how we pulled 5.72 out because that's a
 
00:57:34.829 --> 00:57:34.839 align:start position:0%
pretty precise
 
00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
number and if the Senate wants to speak
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
to it first I
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
can so I think in terms of you know as
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
the sen Senator Bradley talked about
 
00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:46.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of time spent in terms of
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
how can we take the money in and make
 
00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
payments in a way that is um if you will
 
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
um has a lesser impact on on the uh on
 
00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
the hospitals and the maximized impact
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
for the state I think when um 91% in the
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
Senate discussions when 91% was a
 
00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
position that the hospitals weren't
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
supporting there was um what else was
 
00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:18.039 align:start position:0%
available to be able to um if you will
 
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
and in what forms we could pay it out
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
that would would lead to that to smooth
 
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:26.839 align:start position:0%
out the the red um further and I think
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's basically the the number it's
 
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
also important to point out it's it's
 
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
for four years and it's a constant
 
00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
amount for each of the four years so as
 
00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
the tax grows that will become a smaller
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
and smaller
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
percentage follow it okay so I know
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
you're in an awkward position so I I
 
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing is that the
 
00:58:53.069 --> 00:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
5.72% is a another way of renaming some
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
of the uh contribution being made to get
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
us close to 93% by way of a a different
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
vehicle but the same
 
00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
destination I think it is adding money
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
to the 91% I think it's the simplest way
 
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:08.839 align:start position:0%
to say I don't think there was any um I
 
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
mean I think the reason it's in the way
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
it is is to be explicit of where the
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
money's coming from um the actually the
 
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
that particular model worked better for
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
the hospitals than the straight 93% that
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
was in the original version that's
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's why it came out that way um you
 
00:59:29.029 --> 00:59:29.039 align:start position:0%
know my role in this process has not
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
been as a negotiator it's been to
 
00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
provide information to the
 
00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
parties representative L um thank you Mr
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
chairman um this may be a naive question
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
but when I look at the 13 uh 3192
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
million collected and then the 305
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
million paid out to me that looks like a
 
00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
return rate of 95 a. half% can you tell
 
00:59:53.029 --> 00:59:53.039 align:start position:0%
me how I'm wrong in that interpretation
 
00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
because looking at the numbers that's
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
what makes sense but I I have have to be
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
missing something here I I think in
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
terms of your math in terms of um that's
 
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
not necessarily um wrong when you add
 
01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
the two together um but um it it may not
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
be 95.2 but it's it's a higher number
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
than 91 let's put it that
 
01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.630 align:start position:0%
than 91 let's put it that
way

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
Henry um because all these funds that
 
01:00:27.789 --> 01:00:27.799 align:start position:0%
are collected by the that are restricted
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
funds and must be spent on Medicaid
 
01:00:30.799 --> 01:00:32.190 align:start position:0%
funds and must be spent on Medicaid
provider

01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
payments don't the
 
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals because of their size and the
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
amount of Medicaid services they deliver
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
already get above
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
91% of the metb back in a way through
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
um because they do the most
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so I guess the the payment
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
stream to hospital is what what comes
 
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:07.240 align:start position:0%
out of this plus the the regular
 
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
payments which uh representative
 
01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
Stringham was talking about um for the
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
larger hospitals I think generally not
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
just in New Hampshire but everywhere
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
that um Medicaid um when you count all
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
the cost all the payments that they get
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
together is typically no higher than
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
Medicare and typically some what less
 
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
than Medicare you know could be as much
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
as 20% or more for some hospitals less
 
01:01:34.829 --> 01:01:34.839 align:start position:0%
so it's the payments together trying to
 
01:01:38.029 --> 01:01:38.039 align:start position:0%
bring them up to uh an adequacy um you
 
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
know and the the sort of the CMS
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
Benchmark is to get hospitals under
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
Medicaid between 80 and 100% of
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
Medicare could I follow please yes and
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
with directed
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
payments in addition to getting around a
 
01:01:54.599 --> 01:01:56.109 align:start position:0%
payments in addition to getting around a
60%

01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
60%
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
Federal match versus 50 doesn't
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
CMS either allow or require some quality
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
metrics yes um that would be helpful for
 
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
the state yeah the directed payments uh
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
do come with accountability and that's
 
01:02:18.269 --> 01:02:18.279 align:start position:0%
also a provision in the bill that um
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
that the directed payments have to come
 
01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
with a set of of quality metrics to try
 
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
to lift up the performance of the system
 
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
and um you know in the bill there's um
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to meet those metrics
 
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
you know fall in the hospitals and
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
that's um you know something that has to
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
be those metrics have to be developed in
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
CMS Senator Bradley uh yeah I I just
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
want to make clear that the 5.72 is not
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
general fund Revenue it's coming from um
 
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
the the Met revenue and and that because
 
01:03:02.269 --> 01:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
of the enhanced match um of the 8.6 it's
 
01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
actually right it's it's actually better
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day it's what I
 
01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
think the hospitals can acquest to and
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
we're not litigating
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
potentially um you know this issue and
 
01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
throwing you know the metx
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
constitutionality back into question and
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
the impact that that has on future
 
01:03:29.309 --> 01:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
budget so I I think
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
that if there's a disagreement between
 
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
some of the parties that's what it's
 
01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
over and it's a a relatively in the
 
01:03:37.150 --> 01:03:37.160 align:start position:0%
overall scheme of things and the
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
importance to the state and to the
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals and patient care and New
 
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think it's a pretty small
 
01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
to I think the time has come for me to
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
return the favor and explain the process
 
01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
by which I came to the opinion I have
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
today so I was thrown at this very late
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
process normally something like this
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
especially a $5.7 million allocation
 
01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
would go through our health and human
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
services committee if it succeeded there
 
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
it would then go to finance where a lot
 
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
of it's the largest committee a lot of
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
very smart people would have worked on
 
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:21.640 align:start position:0%
that and probably answered ahead of time
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
most of the questions that we have today
 
01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
I have have received um I don't want to
 
01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:33.039 align:start position:0%
say threats but hardcore opinions I'll
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
veto if this will sue if that um it's
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
because I am new to this Arena and
 
01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
people don't know me I doesn't help um
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
cuz the house position began at a hard
 
01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
no there were questions about doing it
 
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
this way where I had to make sure we
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
weren't even going to violate House
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
Rules by receiving the report if there
 
01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
was one our beginning position was no
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
instead of making a long protracted
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
negotiation I I met with Senator Bradley
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
and said you know what fine we'll do the
 
01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:08.039 align:start position:0%
91% and the other change to nine at that
 
01:05:10.269 --> 01:05:10.279 align:start position:0%
point probably my fault I had no idea
 
01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
that this $5.7 million was included I
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
then got questions about was that just
 
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
gaming it to get the 93 that were
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
negotiating down to 91 there is not time
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
to do this properly so
 
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
I think that we're being very
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
magnanimous when the house position is
 
01:05:31.870 --> 01:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
we'll do the
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
91% the 9% but not the 5.7 million and
 
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
um can keep telling me about lawsuits
 
01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:42.440 align:start position:0%
and my response is going to be everybody
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
knew this deadline was coming why didn't
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
you start working earlier so that it
 
01:05:48.269 --> 01:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
could have gone through the proper
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
process and maybe I'd be sitting here
 
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
with a smile and yes today but that's
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
not what happened um so I'm sorry
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
position say that's unfortunate um but I
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
respect the house and uh respect that
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
yes I think at this point we'll just
 
01:06:23.549 --> 01:06:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.520 --> 01:07:24.510 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%

01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
okay we'll reconvene actually we just
 
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
come back from our break one more time
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
on Bill
 
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
11:27 um I guess just as a summary of
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
what happened at 9:00 uh we were we went
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
into recess on Tuesday
 
01:23:55.229 --> 01:23:55.239 align:start position:0%
awaiting uh leak legal opinion at the
 
01:23:59.790 --> 01:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
request of Senator Bradley um and we
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
received somewhat of a description of
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
what the problems were
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
although I was hoping the attorney would
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
be here again so he could actually try
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
again at explaining to everybody what
 
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
the problems are so now we've agreed to
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
take another break and we are here
 
01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
supposedly to see a
 
01:24:19.709 --> 01:24:19.719 align:start position:0%
solution to the problems that the
 
01:24:19.719 --> 01:24:21.709 align:start position:0%
solution to the problems that the
attorney

01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
has um or obser ered so do we have any
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
communication from him thank you Mr
 
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
chairman um no so at this point the
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
Senate will aced to the house position
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
where you're going to remove Senate Bill
 
01:24:44.189 --> 01:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
385 58 358 from the bill and we will
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
move forward with the uh underlying Bill
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that the motion the
 
01:24:51.550 --> 01:24:51.560 align:start position:0%
motion still is there but before we do
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
take the uh the vote uh I just want
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
everybody to be clear that I certainly
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
am in support of what 358 attempted to
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
do uh but I've got issues with it the
 
01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
way it was it seems the Senate isn't
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
didn't like my first amendment we can't
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
seem to find a solution uh in a timely
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
fashion so with uh remorse I am going to
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
vote for the motion on the floor which
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
is to remove 358
 
01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:19.639 align:start position:0%
language um the motion was we we exceed
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
to the Senate position with the further
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
amendment of removing that language
 
01:25:25.470 --> 01:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
anybody else care to speak before we do
 
01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:26.590 align:start position:0%
anybody else care to speak before we do
our

01:25:26.590 --> 01:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
vote seeing none house members all in
 
01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.470 align:start position:0%

03:42:48.630 --> 03:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
and that's already in there it's already
 
03:43:06.070 --> 03:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:06.080 --> 03:43:07.630 align:start position:0%
 
already

03:43:07.630 --> 03:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:43:10.510 --> 03:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
okay all right I'm reopening the um
 
03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference on House Bill
 
03:43:15.830 --> 03:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
318 and with that I believe that um we
 
03:43:17.910 --> 03:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
have come to the final agreement there
 
03:43:20.870 --> 03:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
is one change that last second change we
 
03:43:25.309 --> 03:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
are going to be making and that is um on
 
03:43:27.590 --> 03:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
page five of the well I'm not even sure
 
03:43:30.149 --> 03:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
if this is the bill or not I'm just
 
03:43:32.429 --> 03:43:32.439 align:start position:0%
using the thing you guys gave me um
 
03:43:34.830 --> 03:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
anyway the language will be right now it
 
03:43:36.030 --> 03:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
says the court shall have the authority
 
03:43:37.510 --> 03:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
under paragraph one to set cash a
 
03:43:39.070 --> 03:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
corporate charity Bill if the court
 
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
finds the defendant is in the court may
 
03:43:43.149 --> 03:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
only set cash bail corporate security
 
03:43:44.710 --> 03:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
amount in the amount that defendant's
 
03:43:46.630 --> 03:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
able to make we're striking the part
 
03:43:49.070 --> 03:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
that ISS the defendant is found inent
 
03:43:50.149 --> 03:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
it's just going to say the court may
 
03:43:52.030 --> 03:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
only set cash bail corporate security
 
03:43:53.389 --> 03:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
amount and the amount the defendant is
 
03:43:55.189 --> 03:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
able to make in other words so that cash
 
03:43:57.910 --> 03:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
bail is not used to hold someone um for
 
03:43:59.830 --> 03:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
the purpose of holding them cash Ba's
 
03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
intent is to make sure that someone
 
03:44:02.790 --> 03:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
shows up for court not to hold them so
 
03:44:04.910 --> 03:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
they can't come back um does everyone
 
03:44:07.510 --> 03:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
here agree with that yes Mr chairman and
 
03:44:08.870 --> 03:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
just for anybody watching so on the
 
03:44:10.910 --> 03:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
draft amendment that we have before us
 
03:44:18.670 --> 03:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
it's on page four line 11 m on Amendment
 
03:44:18.680 --> 03:44:21.710 align:start position:0%
it's on page four line 11 m on Amendment
2285

03:44:21.710 --> 03:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:21.720 --> 03:44:24.910 align:start position:0%
 
page4

03:44:24.910 --> 03:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:29.269 --> 03:44:29.279 align:start position:0%
line1 yes and that has been sent to alls
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
so what I I propose is each member we
 
03:44:32.750 --> 03:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
going to vote y or nay and we're going
 
03:44:34.510 --> 03:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
to vote with the intent that that is on
 
03:44:35.790 --> 03:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
the document we're going to sign
 
03:44:38.469 --> 03:44:38.479 align:start position:0%
downstairs LS does everyone agree with
 
03:44:47.189 --> 03:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:48.710 --> 03:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
if the court find no this is going to be
