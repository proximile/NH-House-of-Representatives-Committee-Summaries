family uh Court uh the subcommittee
 
00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh perjury and I want to
 
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
welcome uh all my committee members and
 
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 align:start position:0%

appreciate that and again um I apologize
 
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
I know we had an earlier meeting that uh
 
00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:26.679 align:start position:0%
where we didn't have a quorum and that
 
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
that it's unfortunate but but we're
 
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 align:start position:0%
we're all here today so before we begin
 
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask everyone if you please
 
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
Allegiance I pledge allegiance to the
 
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
flag of the United States of America and
 
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
to the Republic for which it stands one
 
00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
nation under God indivisible with
 
00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
all all right so um the way I would like
 
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
uh to proceed is this
 
00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 align:start position:0%
um this is we've dubb this as a a sort
 
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
of work session but if there are people
 
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
who would like to be heard um at the
 
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
beginning I'm happy to do that one with
 
00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
a couple of a couple of
 
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
caveats first of all I want to make it
 
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
clear to everyone we are not going to be
 
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
retrying any particular cases we have no
 
00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 align:start position:0%
authority to do that and we're not going
 
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
to do that secondly the issue here that
 
00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
of of the the charge of this
 
00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is the issue of of
 
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
perjury um and I guess what I would say
 
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
is for purposes of of uh moving this
 
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.350 align:start position:0%
is for purposes of of uh moving this
process

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 align:start position:0%
forward let's assume that there is an
 
00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 align:start position:0%
issue of a problem with perjury in uh in
 
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
general or in family law cases let's
 
00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
assume that that's true I I think there
 
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
might be a question of the extent of it
 
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 align:start position:0%
but let's assume that that's true what I
 
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
would like you to direct your comments
 
00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 align:start position:0%
up uh on if you wish to be heard is what
 
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
do you propose is the solution for that
 
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
tell us what you think how the law
 
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
should be changed in your view to um to
 
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
address that issue and the last thing I
 
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
would say is I I'm going to uh limit
 
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
people's comments to 3 minutes so please
 
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 align:start position:0%
get to the point tell us what you what
 
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
you think uh the the the uh the way that
 
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
the law should be changed uh to address
 
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
your concerns so with that um I'll call
 
00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 align:start position:0%
uh sir would you like to come
 
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 align:start position:0%

card oh yeah if if you wouldn't mind if
 
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
to just and you you know you can sir you
 
00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
can you can tell us what you want to
 
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
tell us first but then just fill it out
 
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
before you leave if you would please
 
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
thank you and anyone else who wants to
 
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 align:start position:0%
thing so my name
 
00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
is there you go thank you okay it's good
 
00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
H so my name is Caren bani I live in
 
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
Brooklyn New Hampshire so I know that uh
 
00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 align:start position:0%
Ju Ju Just to confirm no specific
 
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
details about what I believe are
 
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
examples of why we need the law change
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
right so here's something that occurred
 
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
that I believe of why I'm
 
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
of the type of law that's required in
 
00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 align:start position:0%
family court or is that okay right I
 
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
would like no I would like you to focus
 
00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
on what you think you know what you
 
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
think uh the solution should be to if if
 
00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 align:start position:0%
there's a perjury problem what should be
 
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
the solutions absolutely um so I so I
 
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
would say l layer one the the the the
 
00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Family Division circuit
 
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
court rules specifically state that
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence do not apply right and
 
00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of discretion when it
 
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
comes to what that Rules of Evidence is
 
00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
um the standard for Rules of Evidence
 
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
obviously we know have different kind of
 
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
Standards right so you have your very
 
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
basic probable cause that's not enough
 
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
to make a Judicial decision but enough
 
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
is in a criminal scenario potential to
 
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
pursue charges right in investigation we
 
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
know there's preponderance of evidence
 
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
and we know that there's Beyond A
 
00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt family courts are
 
00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 align:start position:0%
generally prant of evidence however
 
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
there is a conflict between No Rules of
 
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
Evidence and preponderance of evidence
 
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 align:start position:0%
this has been something that's common
 
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
across a lot of cases so I think that's
 
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
number one
 
00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 align:start position:0%
uh number two how are we making sure
 
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
that folks like Garden at Liams who are
 
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
technically under the law expert witness
 
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
testimony right not being treated as
 
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
100% truth what's happening a lot in
 
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
family court is that the why discretion
 
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
afforded does not have a basis to
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
determine the like what is the approach
 
00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
judges are using to determine
 
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
credibility right so I I I'll give an
 
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
example especially where where this
 
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
becomes really atic uh and I'm open
 
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
about this I'll share with you I'm I'm
 
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
autistic my wife has ADHD right so neuro
 
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
Divergence is very very important to
 
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
understand how people come across judges
 
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
are using credibility determinations
 
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
based on very clearly what stated often
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
demeanor Behavior eye contact all of
 
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
those things at DIS disadvantage because
 
00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 align:start position:0%
there's not enough and this is where the
 
00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
diversity inclusion committee actually
 
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
will be huge for for making sure that we
 
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
understand how judges are being trained
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
to understand how to use that power that
 
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
whyde discretion is problematic when you
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
do not have an accurate measure there's
 
00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 align:start position:0%
actually a supreme court mg cury brief
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
that recently happened due to the the uh
 
00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 align:start position:0%
the um FTX collapse right so that this
 
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
is in the financial crime space but that
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
gentleman s bang fredman he uh there was
 
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
an Ami cury that was submitted that
 
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
explains how neurod Divergence manifests
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
especially in the court system and I
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
think that's important for New Hampshire
 
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
family court system
 
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
the the next thing is I would say
 
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
attorneys are attorneys properly trained
 
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they understand the
 
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
difference between cander towards a
 
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
tribunal right and their Duty the
 
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
problem that I've seen today is
 
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys do not know the line of CER
 
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
towards the tribunal versus when you're
 
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
zealously advocating for your client and
 
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
when that line is crossed and that line
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
is different in criminal for an attorney
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
as a criminal defense attorney for
 
00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
example versus in family court and what
 
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing is that the criminal defense
 
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are also coming into
 
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
Family Court are using criminal defense
 
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
CER towards the tribunal standards and
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
impacting family court right where that
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
does not apply and judges are not
 
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
holding that accountable so again I
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
can't go into those details in three
 
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
minutes but I would say do really
 
00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
understanding how does CER toward the
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
towards a tribunal manifest the the the
 
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
next layer of that is judges also have a
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the judicial code of
 
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
conduct to make sure that they are
 
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
actively reporting issues such as
 
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
professional conduct issues whether it's
 
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
to the Garden at lighten board whether
 
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
it's to the Ado so or do judges have a
 
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
good view in what is the line of cander
 
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
towards a tribunal when does that go
 
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
towards breaching that when does that go
 
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
even further to potentially being
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
criminal right to say perjury these
 
00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
lines it can't be one is it perjury or
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
is it not it has to start with well do
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
we have a how do we determine
 
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
credibility right that's the most basic
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
from credibility you go into is there a
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
CER towards a tribunal type issue
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
manifesting here right from the
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
professionals representing those
 
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
individuals then you might go as far as
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
now is it perjury right and not just
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
perjury as in the one part of title 641
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
but any part of title 641 right because
 
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:51.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes what's also occurring is you
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
have this distinction of well
 
00:07:56.189 --> 00:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
technically they said this under oath
 
00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
verbally that could be perjury or it's
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor equivalent but then you also
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
have a written statement that's the
 
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.360 align:start position:0%
opposite but the written statement does
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
not match the verbal statement and is
 
00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:08.919 align:start position:0%
that technically perjury that's for a
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
criminal court and judge to decide but
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
if you have these other layers behind it
 
00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:15.759 align:start position:0%
it allows Family Court judges to not
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
have to make a criminal court decision
 
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
that's for prosecutors and Criminal
 
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
Courts to try but knowing when to refer
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
it by properly thinking about have I
 
00:08:28.149 --> 00:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
made a valid credibility decision have I
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
held the candidate towards a tribunal
 
00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:32.519 align:start position:0%
standard right if you're not a lawyer if
 
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
you're a gardened lier or any other
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
expert testimony what are equivalent
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
laws and standards that we can put in
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
place that are like cander towards a
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
tribunal so everyone is held to that
 
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
standard if you're a professional that's
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
testifying right then go to Pur all
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
right thank you questions for this
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
witness thank you very much sir anyone
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%

you go good morning everyone thank you
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
for your continued work on this
 
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:27.320 align:start position:0%
important topic my name is Thomas valard
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of the division of
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
public protection at the New Hampshire
 
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office but for close
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
to 25 years I was a criminal prosecutor
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh primarily in the straford County
 
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and for 16 of those years
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
was the um elected County attorney part
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
of my role as the uh one of the chief
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officers for a county
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
was to work with the courts for what we
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
all understood was something that
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
happened with some prevalence which was
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
the Spectre of perjury in court cases uh
 
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:02.680 align:start position:0%
that can certainly be in criminal cases
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
we're here today talking about family
 
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
cases so uh what I did and what I upon
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
information and belief my County
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
attorney colleagues did was we sat down
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
with the clerks of each of the uh County
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
Superior Courts and circuit courts and
 
00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:19.959 align:start position:0%
said how are we going
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
to uh handle these complaints when we
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
believe that there has been something
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
that actually qualifies as perjury and I
 
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
have to say actually because perjury has
 
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:31.240 align:start position:0%
an incredibly high
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
standard of proof because there are five
 
00:10:36.509 --> 00:10:36.519 align:start position:0%
different elements that must be met and
 
00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
in my communications with the public in
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
regards to why aren't you going forward
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
with a perjury case it was typically
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
because of those five elements if you
 
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
look at chapter 641 there are a number
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
of crimes in there perjury is 641 colon
 
00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:52.839 align:start position:0%
1 because it is the toughest one to
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
prove and it should be with those five
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
elements I can go through those with you
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
but I think you're familiar with them so
 
00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
we sat down with the
 
00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:03.079 align:start position:0%
clerks and uh were able to create a
 
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:05.720 align:start position:0%
funneling system where when a judge
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
recognized that something could be
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
perous it was sent to the county
 
00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
attorney uh because it's a felony and uh
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
whether it was family court or any other
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
court and I rece I've received over the
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
years referrals from all the different
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
courts so I'll stick just with the
 
00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
family court what we would do is we
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
would then assign it to an investigator
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh we would do interviews and we would
 
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
do a full criminal investigation into
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
whether uh that statement qualified as a
 
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
perous statement again if it was made
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
knowingly if when it was made it was
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
made with the belief that it was false
 
00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:44.839 align:start position:0%
so it's not a mistaken statement it is
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
something that someone knows is false it
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
was made in an official proceeding it
 
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
was made under oath and probably the
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
hardest element is that it was material
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
that means it substantially affected the
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
outcome of that particular controversy
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly um even after due
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
investigation it was often found that U
 
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
it might have been uh a false swearing
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
or some other uh permutation of perjury
 
00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:13.959 align:start position:0%
but um if it's being reported to this
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
committee that perjury is not being
 
00:12:17.509 --> 00:12:17.519 align:start position:0%
looked at or prosecuted or is under
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
reported it might just be because it's
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
such a high mountain climb uh for
 
00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
someone to be charged with perjury and
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
then to prove that perjury and it should
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
be it's a very serious crime so I just
 
00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:31.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh attend this morning to
 
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your continued work on
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
this to um offer my 25 years of uh
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
diance into this issue I've prosecuted
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
perjury cases before I've reviewed many
 
00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
more than I've charged unfortunately
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
because of the high standard that
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
perjury requires in order to charge a
 
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
citizen of the State of New Hampshire
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
with a most serious crime which is
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
felony so I don't know if there are any
 
00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
questions based on what I've presented
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
questions for yes uh represent pearon
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
question um I want to list the five
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh items that must be met I have knowing
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
it was a false statement it was made
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
under oath it was made in a public
 
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
hearing and was material to the case
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
what am I
 
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
missing those are four so uh you make a
 
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:27.880 align:start position:0%
false statement it must you must believe
 
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's false you know it's false okay it's
 
00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
material two it's under oath and an
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
official proceeding and it's knowingly
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
the men's Ray is not in there but uh it
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
must be made knowingly men's race yeah

the mental state so it's its absence of
 
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.470 align:start position:0%
the mental state so it's its absence of
mistake

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%

office and investigating thank you for
 
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
doing that I'm wondering about the other
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
um crimes that are listed um in 4641
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
like false swearing the UN un uh sorn
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
falsification and tampering with
 
00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:15.759 align:start position:0%
Witnesses are because those are also I
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
think probably what the people that have
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
before you know appeared before this
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
committee it's not just we're using
 
00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:22.759 align:start position:0%
perjury for a term that's actually a lot
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
broader are those also um crimes that
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
may be referred to your your former
 
00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:29.670 align:start position:0%
may be referred to your your former
office

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
um by the judges and are they also ones
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
that you would have investigated
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for asking that
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
question because perjury is a place to
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
start and then we would step down to for
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
example 6412 which is false swearing if
 
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
you line up the elements with perjury
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
you you see that false swearing is
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
almost the same as perjury but it you
 
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
don't need to prove materiality which
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
again is a very big issue when we're
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about comparing statements
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh with with other statements that are
 
00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
made so we would go through the whole
 
00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.710 align:start position:0%
made so we would go through the whole
panop

00:14:59.710 --> 00:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
panop
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
um I also neglected to mention in my
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
initial statements that not just the
 
00:15:04.749 --> 00:15:04.759 align:start position:0%
courts referred these cases but we would
 
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
take any citizen complaint at least in
 
00:15:09.069 --> 00:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
straford County any citizen that
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
complained and believed that they were
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
not treated fairly by the court because
 
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:15.880 align:start position:0%
their opponent had entered in perjures
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
or or uh uh knowingly made false
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
statements into a court record we would
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
still open the same investigation um go
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
and pull the record and do those
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
interviews and conduct a full Criminal
 
00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
inv instigations so and I don't again
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
upon information believe I believe my
 
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
other nine County attorney colleagues
 
00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
thing yes questions representative ball
 
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um just for
 
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
clarification where does um like filing
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
a false police report if you make an
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
accusation on a police report or you
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
actually follow through where does that
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
fall because that's something that we
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
heard quite a bit um of people coming in
 
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
testing toine so that's covered in 641
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
colon 4 false reports to law enforcement
 
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
um and it can also be covered in 6413
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
unsworn falsification so these would
 
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:12.680 align:start position:0%
then have uh you know one element less
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
which was it's not made in official
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
proceeding for example or some other
 
00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:18.759 align:start position:0%
permutation but those are step Downs
 
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
again from perjury then false
 
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
swearing clarification yes follow go
 
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
ahead so just to clarify so you're
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
saying it's not made in a I'm sorry what
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
did it wasn't made in a um how did you
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
word that again an official proceeding
 
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
in an official but if the police record
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
is brought in as part of the official
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
proceeding or it's questioned or it's
 
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:47.720 align:start position:0%
now becomes part of the um testimony
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
isn't that then falling under the
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
perjury because now it is being claimed
 
00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
in a
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
proceeding if it's a statement that's
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
sworn to in is material so then then he
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
would if you're talking about perjury so
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
now you're talking about an oral
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
statement from a report am I
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
understanding your question correctly so
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
the this false statement is made in a
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
police report and then is sworn to under
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
oath an official proceeding in his
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
material as a oral perjury statement yes
 
00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:16.839 align:start position:0%
because the police report is then used
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
as part of the court case or it could be
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
used as part of the um where the child
 
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
custody is going to be or how things are
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
going to happen within the um Family
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
Court so it it finds its way into family
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
court and I think that's what people
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
came to testify is that but now it was a
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
false statement on a police report but
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
now it's being entered as part of the
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
proceedings in the family court and it's
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
being then used to withhold children
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes from a parent if the false
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
written statement through some colloquy
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
with that judge are you adopting that as
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
your testimony here because the person
 
00:17:56.669 --> 00:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
would have to testify under oath that
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
the written statement is their testimony
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
and in that proceeding if that course of
 
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
action was taken then maybe that could
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
qualify as a pjur statement but
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise there' be two separate
 
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
analyses because if you're dealing with
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
um unsworn falsification that's a
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
written false statement so it it can't
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
be oral so it have to be adopted as an
 
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
oral statement under oath in an official
 
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
proceeding so what is the penalty for
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
filing a false police report that's a a
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it can be handled in the
 
00:18:26.909 --> 00:18:26.919 align:start position:0%
discretion of the prosecutor as an a
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
other questions uh representative
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much um and I'm I'm
 
00:18:41.789 --> 00:18:41.799 align:start position:0%
going to expose my ignorance here um can
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
you tell me if there is any
 
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.950 align:start position:0%
you tell me if there is any
difference

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
between uh the occurrences we're talking
 
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
about now in a civil matter versus in a
 
00:18:59.789 --> 00:18:59.799 align:start position:0%
criminal matter is that the particular
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
issue irrelevant if you're looking
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
exclusively at the perjury thank you
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
representative Smith no it's it's the
 
00:19:10.149 --> 00:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
same rules for any proceeding so
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
criminal civil family um these laws
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
would apply to any statement that is
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
made in a false Manner and then with the
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
other elements that are required for the
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
particular crime that could I follow up
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
of course yes um we also have over the
 
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
year or more that we've been trying to
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
sort out
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
this can of worms I don't know what else
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
to say um we frequently hear uh
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
reverence to concern that um the court
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
in question does not use Rules of
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
Evidence and we've had very clear
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
explanation of
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
why the court and the individual judges
 
00:19:59.149 --> 00:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
consider that to be appropriate
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
in the Family
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
Court does that
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
reality when when you measure the costs
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:20:07.559 --> 00:20:11.149 align:start position:0%
and the
benefits

00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
um is
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
it appropriate to conclude that not
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
having Rules of
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
Evidence in this court helps us get
 
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.950 align:start position:0%
Evidence in this court helps us get
closer

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
closer
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
to our goal of
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
Justice not having rules of evidence
 
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
strictly applied in family core seems to
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
to move the needle in the direction
 
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
towards being fair to folks who are so
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
often representing themselves and don't
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
understand the ins and outs of um
 
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
evidentiary rules as a criminal
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
practitioner I practiced under strict
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
rules of evidence and I can tell you
 
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
that um after almost every criminal
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
trail that I concluded I was convinced
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
that someone had committed perjury
 
00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
because you could not line up the
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
testimonies right but the the big part
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
of the FactFinder is to rectify ify
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
those differences and those Shades
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
between two competing sets of of um
 
00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:06.039 align:start position:0%
statements and determine who was more
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
credible so I don't believe that in and
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
of itself the suspension or the the
 
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
loose application of the Rules of
 
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
Evidence um leads us to uh some sort of
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
solution on this perjury issue and I do
 
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960 align:start position:0%
think it's the fair way to treat people
 
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
particularly not just in Circuit Court
 
00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
uh generally but certainly in family
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
court and if I could just ask one more
 
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
question the chair began um this work
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
session by asking for suggestions of how
 
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.870 align:start position:0%
session by asking for suggestions of how
we

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
could or not we how the court
 
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0%
system could be improved to even better
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of the citizens of the
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
state do you
 
00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
have without you conferring with the
 
00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
attorney general or the Chief Justice do
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
you have any
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
suggestions that um you would make
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
perhaps just for us to consider of
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
changes um that we might
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
encourage you I recently had the
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to sit at the confirmation
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
hearing for one of the most recent
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court judges who's a good friend
 
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
of mine and I really enjoyed his
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
presentation in regards to why he wanted
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be a circuit court judge which was
 
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
you know the importance of really
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
listening in to the litigants before you
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
and making sure that you were hearing
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
them so that that art of active
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
listening uh and making sure that those
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
litigants are heard and have an
 
00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
speak I think there are more and more
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
judges who are being appointed and
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
confirmed who are employing those
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
techniques and so the there's not this
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
tremendous wall between the the
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
litigants especially prosay litigant and
 
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
our judges that is going to that just in
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
and of itself is going to help improve
 
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
The public's perception of going to the
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
People's Court which is really what the
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
circuit court is and no more so than
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
family court where you're dealing with
 
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
the really the most custic and traumatic
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
issues that families can go through so I
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
I think that we're developing into a
 
00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:18.919 align:start position:0%
scenario uh in the courts where the
 
00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
judges are understanding more we really
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
do need to listen we can't just call
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
people up and be sitting 10 feet above
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
them and demand that they they State
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
there case in um very esoteric and
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
evidentiary based five minute
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
presentations and really solve the
 
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
problems of what families are going
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
through so um I don't want to do too
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
much padding on the back but um I think
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
the family courts come a long way in
 
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
regards to appoint uh having appointed
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
to it folks that understand the
 
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.110 align:start position:0%
to it folks that understand the
complicated

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
issues I'm sorry could I just do one
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
more I find that that interesting
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
statement I wonder wonder if you could
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
support that in any way because a
 
00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
concern that we hear repeated again and
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
again is that there are many fine
 
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:14.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are being um nominated and
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
confirmed for these courts but that does
 
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
not mean that they have had any
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
experience in the family court or any
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
meaningful training about how
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
this the issues in the Family Court
 
00:24:38.389 --> 00:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
differ from those issues that are on uh
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
the table in other
 
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
courts yeah the training for attorneys
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
has been changing quite a bit if you
 
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.240 align:start position:0%
look at the selections of continuing leg
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
legal education classes for example it's
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
much more in the vein of uh not the
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
science of trying cases but the art of
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
negotiation and deal with people in
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
mediation and many more courses in
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
regards to what is actually going on in
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
people's lives you talk about substance
 
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
abuse mental health issues um the
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
complications of uh multigenerational
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
Families how to deal with all those
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
kinds of issues those things just in the
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
25 years that I've been practicing those
 
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
were unheard of um just a few years ago
 
00:25:22.389 --> 00:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
but now we're all being exposed to it
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
and trying to understand that better in
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
order to serve the people that we're
 
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
coming in contact with and those judges
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
who those individuals who have been
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
nominated have all um been required to
 
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
um participate in those they're not I
 
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if they've been required to
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
but uh We've certainly been exposed to
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
it and there would have been a awful lot
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
more opportunity for folks to be taking
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
courses uh in those veins to understand
 
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
what's really going on before them thank
 
00:25:58.350 --> 00:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:59.950 --> 00:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
question again um just for clarification
 
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
um are you saying that you would support
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
the one judge uh one Court one judge as
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to having a family see multiple
 
00:26:13.389 --> 00:26:13.399 align:start position:0%
judges um because you mentioned about
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
the importance of listening um and if
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
the cases moved from different judges
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
have they ever really heard the whole
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
case so that's that's the first part is
 
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
do you support one judge um one court
 
00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
and then as a followup to that um then I
 
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:34.360 align:start position:0%
asking so one of the one thing that
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
keeps coming in front of us is that the
 
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
the judges in Circuit Court don't have
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
clerks so there's no one even if they do
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
start moving around that the families
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
are seeing multiple judges who's really
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
gleaning through to remind the judge of
 
00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
the previous conversations and what
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
could have been said um how is that
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
going to happen if we have no clerk so
 
00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering what your suggestions
 
00:26:59.070 --> 00:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
first of all how you feel about one
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
judge one court and then um also what do
 
00:27:04.029 --> 00:27:04.039 align:start position:0%
we do about the fact that how are we
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
listening if the judge doesn't have
 
00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:07.799 align:start position:0%
someone help them to go through and
 
00:27:10.029 --> 00:27:10.039 align:start position:0%
glean through especially some of these
 
00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:11.559 align:start position:0%
that I mean these divorce cases go on
 
00:27:11.559 --> 00:27:12.590 align:start position:0%
that I mean these divorce cases go on
for

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
years thank you sure uh having been um a
 
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
party in cases are go on for years I
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
always enjoyed having one judge rather
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
than having to refresh a new judge in
 
00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
regards to what was going on in the last
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
proceeding there's certainly an
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
efficiency to that and there's also uh
 
00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
some comfort unless that judge is not
 
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
with you at all in which case you you
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
would very much like to have a change in
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
uh in judges um but you know so there's
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
there's efficiency to it I think there's
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
also um a level of comfort that someone
 
00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
actually is in a way your judge um I I
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to make recommendations or
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
suggestions but I can certainly share my
 
00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
own practice point on that I would think
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
it would be also disorienting for
 
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
families to constantly see a different
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
judge and have to retell maybe some of
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
the traumatic things that have happened
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
um that might be the shortest way for an
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
inheriting judge to get him or herself
 
00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:05.559 align:start position:0%
up to speed on a Case uh but there's
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
certainly a vicarious trauma there that
 
00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:09.519 align:start position:0%
by all means should be
 
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:12.519 align:start position:0%
avoided um your second question the
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
second question was that there are no
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
clerks for the family court judges and
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
whether that's causing more harm um
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
because there's no way to get to remind
 
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:23.799 align:start position:0%
the judges I mean when you have stacks
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
this big who's leaning through that to
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
remind the judge of well this is what
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
was said in the is what would happening
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing a pattern or bringing
 
00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:34.039 align:start position:0%
those things forward to the judge sure
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
well I you know this is a um maybe a
 
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
side symptom of uh as we are digitizing
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
everything we're asking judges to have
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
just as you have uh a a screen in front
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
of you ostensibly they have the entire
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
record at their disposal and can just
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
click and point and and understand all
 
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
that and and refresh themselves that
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
that's the way it's supposed to work it
 
00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't always because of Technology
 
00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.630 align:start position:0%
doesn't always because of Technology
issues

00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
um it puts a lot of pressure on judges
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%
because judges are becoming more clerk
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
likee um as we continue to consolidate
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
down and we're we're staving off staff
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
um judges are doing more in regards to
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
having to run their own dockets and be
 
00:29:18.149 --> 00:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
clerks so I think it's something for
 
00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:19.519 align:start position:0%
this committee and other committees
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
working with the courts to keep an eye
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
on which is um it's already difficult
 
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:25.480 align:start position:0%
enough to make these decisions on cases
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
but to also have to manage all the
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
electronic doc
 
00:29:30.909 --> 00:29:30.919 align:start position:0%
can be I'd imagine become
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
overwhelming thank you of course other
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
questions for this wit no I just I'm
 
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
sorry go go ahead representative Beth so
 
00:29:40.509 --> 00:29:40.519 align:start position:0%
thank you no problem thank you for this
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
is it's really a repetitive question but
 
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
but since the people that are coming
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
before us this is I practically I wanted
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
to follow up on um my colleague
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
representative Ball's question before um
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
I think what I heard your testimony say
 
00:29:56.509 --> 00:29:56.519 align:start position:0%
if someone an individual citizen were to
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
come to you and say Purge pery or what
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
they consider a false statement I think
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
when I was reading the statute I was so
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
surprised that perjury wasn't just a
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
false statement that it did have those
 
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
five elements and so really it's kind of
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
the the top of the hierarchy of these
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
false statements um and um so if if a
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
citizen would to complain to your office
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
or bring a complaint then your office
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
would investigate that and if it didn't
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
quite meet perjury there are the other
 
00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
like five or six false statement crimes
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
that could be applied it might not me
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
the top but there were other crimes that
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
you would then investigate and prosecute
 
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
that's what you're saying so citizens do
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
have a way to come forward is that
 
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:39.640 align:start position:0%
correct absolutely yes and if I could
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
follow up so you were saying your nine
 
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
other CN Parts you believe this is how
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
they practice in their counties yes upon
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
information believe we all were doing
 
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
the same thing and so then that's a good
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
question as the elections approach for
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
people to talk to their County attorney
 
00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
about or who's running for County
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
attorney to make sure that this is going
 
00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
on in their office a very fair question
 
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
what's the what's your responsibity to
 
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
us trying to use a court and feeling
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
thwarted by being able to do so or at
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
least being able to do so fairly and if
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
there are laws that would allow for that
 
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
fairness to be increased um through the
 
00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:15.799 align:start position:0%
possibility of of the application of
 
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
criminal offenses U what is your office
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
doing to to apply those crimes to my
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
scenario thank you thank you other
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
questions so I guess I just have one
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
question Mr valard and I'm wondering if
 
00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:33.559 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense or any
 
00:31:36.029 --> 00:31:36.039 align:start position:0%
suggestions in terms of the
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
perjury chapter of the rsas itself is
 
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
there anything there that you think
 
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:44.120 align:start position:0%
there should be some part of the statute
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
should be changed or there should be a
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
new statute to deal with you know to
 
00:31:50.629 --> 00:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
deal with some of the things we're
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
talking about now oh thank you Mr
 
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
chairman no you know if you look at the
 
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
chapter on its whole in in regards to
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
written or oral statements it's pretty
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
exacting um as it should be because
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about criminalizing
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
conduct and in some cases felon ising
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
conduct so should we should be pretty
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
specific but it really does
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
cover the vast majority if not all of
 
00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
the scenarios that I've seen over the
 
00:32:17.269 --> 00:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
years of competing statements and are
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
the was a mistake made in one statement
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
or a disagreement made between two
 
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
statements or did someone really make a
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
statement knowing it was
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
false uh and we know object ly what the
 
00:32:31.629 --> 00:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
truth is and so that third example that
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
I just gave you is really difficult to
 
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
discern and then prove Beyond A
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt um and so again back to
 
00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
my original statement which is I think
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
the Under reporting of perjury or people
 
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
saying you know no one ever applies the
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
perjury statute there it may very well
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
have been reviewed by someone or and
 
00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
they just simply felt that they could
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
not meet that high burden but the
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
chapter itself really does cover what
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
you would want it to have cover which is
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
you know obstructing police officers
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
from doing what they're supposed to be
 
00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
doing telling untruth and official
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
proceedings either orally or through
 
00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:08.519 align:start position:0%
written statements um those those are
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
the big ones and um I think the chapter
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
um is exacting as it should be and does
 
00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
cover what we needed to cover I've not
 
00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:18.760 align:start position:0%
seen any holes where I would say the
 
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
legislature should look at
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
XYZ it's it's all in there it just needs
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
to be applied and then need it needs to
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
be applied unfortunately to facts that
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
are so often incredibly murky um and and
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's maybe where the the breakdown in
 
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:34.720 align:start position:0%
the Public's eye I know from having
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
conversations with folks who have
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
referred perjury cases to me and I've
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
said this is why I can't go forward um
 
00:33:43.149 --> 00:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
you know we've had to agree to disagree
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes in um heartily simply because
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's an evidentiary standard to
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
charge someone with a felony for perjury
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
that I I simply did not feel could be
 
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
met even though the statements were 90
 
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
degrees from each other um that does not
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean it it meets all the
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
those five
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
elements yes representative Pearson
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:34:07.629 --> 00:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh in the other
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
committees that are similar to this um
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
we've been looking at the value of
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
having a small booklet that outlines
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
various things especially for prosay
 
00:34:25.950 --> 00:34:25.960 align:start position:0%
litigant who may not know all these
 
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:30.280 align:start position:0%
things um will would a brief discussion
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
of what qualifies for
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
perjury be hopeful if it were added to
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
this document so that before people say
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
wait a minute that's perjury why aren't
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
they doing anything they may already
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
have the answer I realize I'm leading
 
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
the witness but could you answer anyway
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
I think any reference to uh to the rsas
 
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
is always helpful um I will I will tell
 
00:34:56.589 --> 00:34:56.599 align:start position:0%
you that I actually teach this chapter
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
of the r
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
to the new police Cadets and and break
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
them down and we spend a good deal
 
00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
amount of time talking about the
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
difference between perjury unsworn
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
falsification uh false reports of the
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer and the
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
differences between them so they can
 
00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
recognize them on the street when
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
they're trying to discern statements in
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
in real time so we I just use that as an
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
example of um you know it's helpful to
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
understand what is what are the rules in
 
00:35:27.829 --> 00:35:27.839 align:start position:0%
order to apply so I would have to say
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
yes thank you reprentative
 
00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:32.430 align:start position:0%
yes thank you reprentative
appreciate

00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
issues all right is there um anyone else
 
00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:48.200 align:start position:0%

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
up good morning Gail dret Amherst New
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for allowing us to
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
talk today I'm not really prepared cuz
 
00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
we thought there was no public testimony
 
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.240 align:start position:0%
but you guys have legislated the laws
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
there is no enforcement mechanism for
 
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
these laws um 6334 interference with
 
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
child custody this would alleviate a lot
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
of these problems for these parents and
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
I want to say I am not in Family Court I
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
haven't been in family
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
court but I'm involved with lots of
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
parents that have been and it is
 
00:36:30.349 --> 00:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
horrifying for these children to lose
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
their childhood because these laws are
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
not being enforced you guys have done
 
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:35.910 align:start position:0%
not being enforced you guys have done
your

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
job the Judiciary law enforcement they
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
have got to enforce the laws you guys
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
have made it's not fair for these
 
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
children and if there is an abuse
 
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
situation that needs to be dealt with
 
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
immediately you can't wait 6 months with
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
DCF you need psychological evaluation or
 
00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
domestic violence child abuse evaluation
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
immediately they cannot go without
 
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
seeing one parent when there is these
 
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:09.640 align:start position:0%
false allegations it is harmful to
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
children they have lifelong detrimental
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
consequences they will not recover from
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
I mean we come before you time after
 
00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
time and nothing gets resolve there's a
 
00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
little fix here and there you got to
 
00:37:26.349 --> 00:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
enforce the laws that you've already
 
00:37:26.359 --> 00:37:27.870 align:start position:0%
enforce the laws that you've already
made

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
these families are begging you I'm
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
begging you like I keep seeing these
 
00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
parents the children what about the
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
children that's I ask that all the time
 
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
what about the children they don't get a
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
doover please do something for the
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
kids um 6334 again enforce it make an
 
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism you know charge
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
them if you have to nobody wants another
 
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
parent arrested but if that's what you
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
have to do you have to do it you can't
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
keep giving them discretion the judges
 
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
and the law enforcement discretion you
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
are ruining children's
 
00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:07.839 align:start position:0%
lives please do something for these
 
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:10.839 align:start position:0%
kids questions for this
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.670 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
sorry what's that well well I think we I
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
want to hear from representative gay or
 
00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%

00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
when you're done thank you excuse me
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
okay Betty gay Salem um my concern is
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
that some of the places where false
 
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
statements are made are far more
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
detrimental than because they happen
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
more frequently than perjury in court uh
 
00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
just as uh uh
 
00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
was just mentioned earlier when people
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
file false statements either to DCF or
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
police and then they're investigated and
 
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
that usually means that the parent that
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
they're filed against doesn't see their
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
child for X number of
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
months that that false statement when
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's found to be gra uh
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
unfounded that child and the parent
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
they're separated from have been
 
00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
punished but the person who files the
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
false statement goes unpunished and it
 
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
turns into a pattern for some people
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
they play a game repeatedly and there's
 
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
no punishment so even though when we're
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
talking about uh perjury we're really
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
talking about court applications aren't
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
we but the most serious perjury occurs
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
long before it ever goes to court and it
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
happens frequently and and it's a tool
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
that manipulators use so I would hope
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
that we could apply some changes to the
 
00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:07.839 align:start position:0%
law so that we can address that kind of
 
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
perjury even though it's technically
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
it's a false statement but there is no
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
penalty for it and it's used repeatedly
 
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
and it separates children from their
 
00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
times uh I'll just add another concern
 
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
of mine even though I'm sure it doesn't
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
exactly tie to perjury but it's been
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned about one case one
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
judge the very fact that family court is
 
00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
that is a law that is an RSA one Court
 
00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
one one judge it's in Circuit
 
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
Court that's an
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
oxymoron that means you're going to get
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
a different judge so I would like to see
 
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
that fixed and applied
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
because it's just outrageous to pass a
 
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
follow I'm looking to see oh uh the idea
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
that in court perjury has all these five
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
requirements and then it makes a
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
distinction between written and spoken I
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
thought when you filed a written
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
statement that was legitimate I thought
 
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
that had the same
 
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
weight as I thought written and spoken
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
filed both had the same weight
 
00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
apparently it doesn't so if anybody's
 
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
going to file a charge uh written I I
 
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.990 align:start position:0%
going to file a charge uh written I I
mean

00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
spoken it sounds like unless they go and
 
00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.390 align:start position:0%
spoken it sounds like unless they go and
sign

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
sign
 
00:41:51.069 --> 00:41:51.079 align:start position:0%
it it's not it doesn't have the same
 
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
standing in court so I'm kind of
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
discouraged that there's two separate uh
 
00:41:59.950 --> 00:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
interpretation are two separate weights
 
00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
to uh that you can't use a charge um
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
let's see if I can say it
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
better if somebody file calls and says
 
00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
that they think something bad is
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
happening and it actually goes to
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
court they can submit a written
 
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
statement totally different so you can't
 
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
say oh you lied and got us in court
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like the written
 
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.910 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like the written
statement

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
supersedes the the spoken
 
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
statement and so I I find that I I don't
 
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
agree with that I think that should be
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
clarified that if you're going to say
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
something that causes a great deal of
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
effort and Prosecuting or investigating
 
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.950 align:start position:0%
effort and Prosecuting or investigating
a

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.950 align:start position:0%
a
person

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
and it's it gets pretty hairy to figure
 
00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:53.720 align:start position:0%
out if somebody intentionally did that
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
or accidentally did that I think people
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
will be a lot more careful with their
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
actions if they knew if
 
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:03.559 align:start position:0%
they they could no longer say well I
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
thought that but yet they triggered a
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
great deal of action that harmed the
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
person they were
 
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
accusing so I apologize that all these
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
are disparate facts or disparate con
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
concerns but they are they are concerns
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
that I think need to be addressed and
 
00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
is is not telling the truth
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
before you get to court can be a whole
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
lot more harmful than waiting for court
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
to file it we're already going through a
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
great deal of suffering because of false
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
statements made to police and to
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
DCF all right thank other questions for
 
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.390 align:start position:0%
DCF all right thank other questions for
this

00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
witness thank
 
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
you m Mr chairman would it be
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate to ask the gentleman from
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office to speak
 
00:43:58.109 --> 00:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
to the issue of false statements that
 
00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
result in a parent not seeing a child
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
for a long time that are later proven to
 
00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
be false statements and what can be done
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
who can do
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
what sure Mr Mr valard do you have any
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
if you have anything additional that you
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
might offer on on
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
okay understand the question um it's
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
statements that are made in official
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
reports in regards to custodial matters
 
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
to the police or
 
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
DCF right and somewhere along the chain
 
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
a child is removed from the home uh from
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
one parent and that parent may not see
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
the child for months but later we
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
discover the statements that that
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
prompted the removal were clearly false
 
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:56.200 align:start position:0%
uh what recourse does the grieved party
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
have in that
 
00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
case so typically those kinds of written
 
00:45:03.549 --> 00:45:03.559 align:start position:0%
statements if qualifying would be
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
covered under unsworn
 
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
falsification so that's a statement uh
 
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
where it's a written or electronic false
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
statement which the person does not
 
00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:15.079 align:start position:0%
believe to be true onor pursue into a
 
00:45:17.309 --> 00:45:17.319 align:start position:0%
form bearing a notification authorized
 
00:45:19.549 --> 00:45:19.559 align:start position:0%
by law to the effect that false
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
statements made therein are
 
00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
punishable so if uh typically these kind
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
we we've added language like that to
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
most statement forms to say hey if
 
00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:30.559 align:start position:0%
you're going to put this on
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
paper no matter what it's covering but
 
00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
certainly if it's covering you know
 
00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.910 align:start position:0%
certainly if it's covering you know
parental

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
parental
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
rights you are swearing to what you're
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
saying here and there's a penalty if we
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
find that you did not tell the truth so
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
that would be covered under unsworn
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
falsification which is applicable to any
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
proceeding criminal family
 
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
civil followup yes um okay then the
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
agreed party should next go where and
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
make what charge so that would be a a
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
report to law enforcement with uh with
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
where law enforcement will then ask so
 
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
your local police department or
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Office where that agency will
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
ask for supporting documentation a a
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
notation to the docket number um likely
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
will pull the the written record to see
 
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
what happened um in regards to to um any
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
other supporting documentation uh so it'
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
be up to uh the citizen who wants to
 
00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:36.559 align:start position:0%
refer this to to bring the supporting
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
documentation forward we would not have
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
as we meaning law enforcement would not
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the best visibility
 
00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
into the matter because most of this is
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
confidential so there' be some
 
00:46:50.109 --> 00:46:50.119 align:start position:0%
obligation to wave some of that
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
confidentiality to pursue an unsworn
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
falsification so there are choices that
 
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
have to be made I should have said that
 
00:46:57.549 --> 00:46:57.559 align:start position:0%
earlier in my testimony which is we do
 
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
ask families to give up some of that
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and sometimes that keeps
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
people from wanting to report as well
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
this sounds like the river is trickling
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
down to something very very tiny um so
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
they go to the local police or the local
 
00:47:16.109 --> 00:47:16.119 align:start position:0%
sheriff who then asks for documentation
 
00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
and what usually happens next so they
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
take that documentation then they will
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
do an investigation in regards to
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
whether the statement on the
 
00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:31.559 align:start position:0%
form uh was uh something that the person
 
00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.160 align:start position:0%
who made the statement did not believe
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
to be true so that's that's very similar
 
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
to that's one of our perjury elements
 
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
right and that it's onor pursu to a form
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
bearing a
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
notification um that you must make
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
truthful statements so it's going to be
 
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
quantifying you made this statement
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
someone is saying that it's not true can
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
we prove Beyond a reasonable doubt that
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
when you made the statement you believed
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
it wasn't true again not a
 
00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
mistake you made the statement on
 
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:03.640 align:start position:0%
October 1st by October 3rd you realized
 
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
that you had made a m made a mistake
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
because um you
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
know and you retract that
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
mistake so that you know there are
 
00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:15.800 align:start position:0%
defenses to this as well but it's
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
something that you made on October 1st
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
you knew it was false and you're
 
00:48:23.549 --> 00:48:23.559 align:start position:0%
somewhat recalcitrant in in or or
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
consistent in maintaining FAL
 
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
what then it would be U because it's a
 
00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:31.559 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor it could very well be
 
00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
prosecuted by um a circuit court
 
00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:35.559 align:start position:0%
prosecutor so prosecutors who are
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
attached to the different police
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
departments um that is likely what would
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
happen and then um I very well aware my
 
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
my Circuit Court was the seventh circuit
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
so in Dover and Rochester I frequently
 
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
saw unsworn falsifications being
 
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
prosecuted by the Circuit Court
 
00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
prosecutors I want to go back to the
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
word it was
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
frequently frequently frequently yes um
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
once again so many people who are upset
 
00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
that their children were taken away they
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
can't didn't see them for a year and
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
everybody knew that what the statement
 
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
was was a blatant
 
00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:16.839 align:start position:0%
lie um maybe they don't know the ropes
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
on what to do next but I'm hearing a lot
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
of grumbling of there was no justice
 
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:23.240 align:start position:0%
here there was a clear lie nothing
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
happened uh maybe they don't know what
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
to do next Maybe this should be in a
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
guide book or something yeah and the
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
grumbling could come because there's a
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
big disconnect between this separate
 
00:49:35.309 --> 00:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
track that we're talking about which is
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
now we're going to criminalize the false
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
statement on a form go into Criminal
 
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:42.799 align:start position:0%
Court wait for that case to get resolved
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
and then go back to family court and say
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
look that person lied that we're talking
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
about months and months and months so
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
you know the folks that are using these
 
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
criminal statutes or at least trying to
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
um that is really more in the wake of
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
what has already happened in the family
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
court case uh it it's not something that
 
00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:05.240 align:start position:0%
is utilitarian in regards to navigating
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
the family court so I don't want to
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
leave this committee with any impression
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
that there's some sort of realtime
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
Justice or rectification of a knowingly
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
made and believed to be made false
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
statement under oath uh in an official
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
proceeding it takes a long time for
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
these things to move through especially
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
through parallel proceedings criminal
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
and then going back to family and since
 
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
people know that they're not disinclined
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
regarding making false statements
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
because they kind of know it's going to
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
take a long time if ever and even if it
 
00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
goes against somebody they're still not
 
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
going to get their kids back for a long
 
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
time I don't know that they know that
 
00:50:45.549 --> 00:50:45.559 align:start position:0%
but that is the reality it simply takes
 
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
time to get sorted out okay thank you
 
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
sir of course other questions for this
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
be thank you I I actually had a
 
00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
different question question but um I'm
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
just curious if um
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
you the allegation that people make
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
false state or individuals would make a
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
false statement because they knew it
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
would take a long time I'm just curious
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
aren't the isn't that what judges are
 
00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
doing is analyzing false statements I
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
know that my um chair Pearson said that
 
00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:19.720 align:start position:0%
everybody knew it was false but if if
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
the judge knew it was false wouldn't
 
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
what what would h i mean in an Inc Court
 
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
statement that everyone knows is false
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
is it the judge's just do they have the
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
discretion or ability to handle that
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
without going to prosecution sure well
 
00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:35.839 align:start position:0%
as the fact finder that would be an easy
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
fact to find um so he or she would have
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
done that already but then they would
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
have that discretion to make a referral
 
00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
for sort of an extra punishment which is
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
not only am I going to find against you
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
because I find you to be patently
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
untruthful but now I'm going to refer
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
you for possible criminal prosecution
 
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:55.160 align:start position:0%
for perjury or some other crime of
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
dishonesty so I could follow up with one
 
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
more question I um and I'm not sure it's
 
00:52:02.349 --> 00:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
a the statement we heard before one
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
Court I mean one judge one case um and
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
um also what to put in the little
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
booklet that if we if that's produced um
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
what I've seen when people have uh
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
individual citizens have complained
 
00:52:21.549 --> 00:52:21.559 align:start position:0%
about not having one judge generally
 
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:23.720 align:start position:0%
it's because they have filed an expart
 
00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
or for an expedited hearing um so I'm
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
curious do you find within just your
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
county that and again I know you I'm
 
00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:32.839 align:start position:0%
surprised how much you know about family
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
court but I appreciate that I'm asking
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
you to step out is it generally one
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
judge for one case in these you know
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
scheduled hearings and is it these
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
experties that are causing issues or
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
maybe an expedited or um and if so is
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
that something maybe to go in the
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
booklet exactly what is an experte you
 
00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
know iMed you know the definition of
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
that and the impact that may have on
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
some of your other uh an individuals
 
00:52:57.069 --> 00:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
other issues thank you appreciate the
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
question it's so granular that I'm not
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
sure I can answer it what I can answer
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
maybe a little more broadly is because
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
of the speed with which the courts are
 
00:53:08.829 --> 00:53:08.839 align:start position:0%
moving because of the incredible
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
overburdensome dockets
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
litigants you know water finds a way
 
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
litigants find a way too to try to get
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
into court and so the use of EX pares
 
00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:20.559 align:start position:0%
for maybe things that ex pares were not
 
00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
intended for could be part of the issue
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
here too um so you know some instruction
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
in regard to what should an expar be
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
used for uh because that is ex anything
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
that's done on an expar basis puts a
 
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
huge burden on the court to get that
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
immediately scheduled which means
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
bumping other things the circuit court
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
has become um a very busy place
 
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
especially with felonies returning back
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
to it um so anything that can be done to
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
try to
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
streamline uh how the circuit court
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
dockets can be maintained on a
 
00:53:56.109 --> 00:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
consistent basis is something that
 
00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
should be looked
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
at other questions saying none thank you
 
00:54:03.549 --> 00:54:03.559 align:start position:0%
again Mr fard thank you okay thank
 
00:54:03.559 --> 00:54:05.950 align:start position:0%
again Mr fard thank you okay thank
you

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:54:08.309 --> 00:54:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh Miss krian I do want to hear from you
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
but I'm if you can I just put you off
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
for just a moment sir if if you want to
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
come up very briefly really briefly to
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
address some specific point
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
yes so um I I'm I actually love the
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
conversation with various people that
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
just occurred because one of the things
 
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
that highlights is there's a concept of
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
polarity management versus problem
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
solution right so everything that we've
 
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
that that's discussed is how do you
 
00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
solve the perjury problem the way what I
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
would frame to this committee is we have
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
two separate constitutional rights
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
issues when you talk about perjury and
 
00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
you talk about criminal law you are now
 
00:54:51.549 --> 00:54:51.559 align:start position:0%
talking about sixth amendment defendant
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
rights implicated right in Family Court
 
00:54:58.750 --> 00:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
we have the 14 Amendment and due process
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
which fundamentally makes sure that due
 
00:55:03.549 --> 00:55:03.559 align:start position:0%
process has to be followed in order for
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
your parental rights to be intact and
 
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
without that you have a problem so the
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
question that about these false
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
statements and what that means and what
 
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
what is the right statutory construction
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
is there the mental State men's Rea
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
they're all valid legal components but
 
00:55:22.589 --> 00:55:22.599 align:start position:0%
what's occurring is you have a
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
conflation of constitutional rights that
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
are occurring so this entire due process
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
process uh that was described is
 
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely valid right and it's valid
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
because in order to account for sixth
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
amendment rights and defendant rights
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
that occur when you're implicating the
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
criminal system you have to follow those
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
things that that is a valid process if
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to say someone did
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
something Beyond A Reasonable Doubt
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
criminally but that is a separate issue
 
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of the polarity or the problem
 
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
we're trying to solve in family court is
 
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
how do you keep a parent's 14th
 
00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:55.839 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights intact so our entire
 
00:55:59.069 --> 00:55:59.079 align:start position:0%
statute construction approach needs to
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
account for what preserves 14th
 
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment due process rights so when a
 
00:56:07.829 --> 00:56:07.839 align:start position:0%
parent makes an improper statement a
 
00:56:10.589 --> 00:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
false statement do we have a statutory
 
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
construction mechanism specific to
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
Family Court proceedings under RSA
 
00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
461 that impacts a parent custodial
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
rights when that that can be proven and
 
00:56:23.789 --> 00:56:23.799 align:start position:0%
how does that occur from a preponderance
 
00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
of evidence standard not a Beyond
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable out
 
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
standard separate from because today the
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
defendant rights from a sixth amendment
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
perspective don't apply in family court
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
because you're not in you're not under
 
00:56:39.549 --> 00:56:39.559 align:start position:0%
criminal charges right you have a
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
combination of some weird amalgamation
 
00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
of a court of equity and a court of
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
justice okay so given that you're
 
00:56:48.029 --> 00:56:48.039 align:start position:0%
accounting for two separate statutes of
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
court of equity and court of justice how
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
do you account for due process so if a
 
00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
parent makes a false statement do we
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity for statutory
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
construction or RC 461 parental rights
 
00:56:59.630 --> 00:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
and responsibilities for example there's
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
numerous additions that have occurred
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
that are still not being carried out in
 
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
Family Court as an example if a parent
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
makes a an abuse allegation and they
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
truly believe that and they pursue
 
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
medical evaluations on that the updated
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
RSA as of 2018 or 19 if I'm not mistaken
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
states that parent cannot lose parental
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
rights however case laws such as Miller
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
versus Todd are still being cited
 
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
contrary to that statutory construction
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
as of the last session as of July 1st
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
you know effective Bill signed July 29th
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
it says that reunification therapy and
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
removing you know a parent a parents
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
right to see their children is
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
prohibited okay now are we going to see
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
judges appli that law so these statutory
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
construction changes that were occur
 
00:57:51.029 --> 00:57:51.039 align:start position:0%
that are occurring one need to be
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
thought about in in the specific Juris
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional jurisdiction do we have
 
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire equivalent of the United
 
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
States Constitution that then goes down
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
to statutory law in New Hampshire right
 
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
that is clear to
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
judges is can't be counteracted by case
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
law right because what's occurred is you
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
have the statutary construction from a
 
00:58:17.069 --> 00:58:17.079 align:start position:0%
public interest perspective is why you
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
created that statutary construction all
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
of the wonderful legal Minds then add
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
their case law to it and that statutory
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
construction has gone out the window so
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
what is our mechanism to fix that
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
statutory construction every time that
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
happens if that is no longer serving the
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
public interest all right thank you Miss
 
00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
krian I wonder if you could come up for
 
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
up good morning
 
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
morning Aon crean general counsel for
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch sure and you know
 
00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if you could tell us
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
based upon your um your experience and
 
00:58:59.069 --> 00:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
your your role with the judicial branch
 
00:59:03.309 --> 00:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
is there anything that you see in this
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
area of per you know the issue of sort
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
of perjury and family law cases where
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
you think that there's some
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
legislative uh um initiative that we
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
should undertake to you know to address
 
00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.390 align:start position:0%
should undertake to you know to address
that

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:22.589 --> 00:59:22.599 align:start position:0%
issue there there's nothing that the
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
courts are requesting but just as a
 
00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:26.839 align:start position:0%
member of the public I I I do understand
 
00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
that many victims
 
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
experience negative feelings working
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement trying to get the
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
evidence that will be persuasive to law
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement and trying to overcome that
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt standard and although
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
our state's uh crime victim Bill of
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
Rights is very focused on the process
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
that victims get once a case is charged
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
their attendance of hearings whether
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
they have a a decision in The Plea um
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
there is not necessarily as much
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
legislative focus on what the rights are
 
00:59:56.109 --> 00:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
before charge I do know that's something
 
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
that the house criminal justice
 
00:59:59.789 --> 00:59:59.799 align:start position:0%
committee is uh considering I don't know
 
01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
that what particular Avenues they're
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
looking at but to the extent that people
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
do not feel as though they have enough
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
transparency on on what law enforcement
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
is doing before the case is charged or
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
how they can interact with law
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement in a productive way and
 
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
bring their case forward and understand
 
01:00:15.789 --> 01:00:15.799 align:start position:0%
what's happening um that's something
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
house criminal justice is looking at I
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
will say New Hampshire is probably one
 
01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
of the better States for this we have
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
high high accountability in our public
 
01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
offices and I'm sure that there are
 
01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
people who are reporting crimes in
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
Chicago who have no idea whether that
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
case is going forward whether they've
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
given enough evidence or or anything
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
like the accountability that um attorney
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
valard is describing where he would
 
01:00:38.029 --> 01:00:38.039 align:start position:0%
personally meet with citizens and
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
discuss with them their case um so I'm
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
not sure that there is necessarily a
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
very large Improvement to make but it's
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
something that this is a very responsive
 
01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:47.480 align:start position:0%
government in New Hampshire and the
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
house criminal justice committee is
 
01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
considering uh for folks that want to
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
bring their views forward there uh there
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
may be some Avenue that they would bring
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
forward but I think lot of the U
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
frustration that victims of crime
 
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
experience is gathering sufficient
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
evidence and meeting that high standard
 
01:01:04.109 --> 01:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
of Reasonable Doubt and that is a
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
universal frustration of victims of
 
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
crime of all kinds of crime I wonder if
 
01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
you could uh and I'm going to open it
 
01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
for questions in a moment but I wonder
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
if you could on the this issue that and
 
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
that um and I know this is a little bit
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
off topic but may to the extent you can
 
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
you can address it this issue of of the
 
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
one one family one judge can you do you
 
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
have any sense of what where does that
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
stand so to speak in the circuit court
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
now great question so it's I believe
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
it's right in the statute that forms the
 
01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
circuit court that it is ambition of the
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court to to honor that one judge
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
one family principle there is no failure
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
of will in the desire to implement that
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
principle there are logistical
 
01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
challenges um one of the logistical Chen
 
01:01:51.309 --> 01:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
the broads set logistical challenges is
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of turnover we we lost a very
 
01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
large Public Service generation that of
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
Judges uh as they were coming up on
 
01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
mandatory retirement ages and we are now
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
confirming a relatively large generation
 
01:02:05.870 --> 01:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's just entering the courts
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
and that meant judges covering three or
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
four different courts um you know judge
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
Bole was driving anywhere he was needed
 
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that the courts are open
 
01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
and available and a judge is there um
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
for litigants who have scheduled court
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
cases but I think we were very impacted
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
by that change over people lost the
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
judge they had appeared in front of
 
01:02:26.589 --> 01:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
potentially for years a new judge starts
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
maybe that judge does their first few
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
months in Manchester where there are
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
other experienced judges that they can
 
01:02:33.069 --> 01:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
get advice from before they'll go to a
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
court where they'll be the only judge
 
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
present um so there there is a lot of
 
01:02:39.069 --> 01:02:39.079 align:start position:0%
logistical challenge in that change over
 
01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
but there is no failure of will uh
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
judges prefer to be on the same case to
 
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
know the case well just as prosecutors
 
01:02:47.069 --> 01:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
prefer to stay on a case and just as
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
defense attorneys prefer to serve a
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
client all the way through a case uh
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's not an experience that a judge
 
01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
enjoys being shuffled from case to case
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
it has just sometimes been a practical
 
01:02:58.269 --> 01:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
necessity of making sure that the courts
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
are staffed and the judges are available
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
when the public needs
 
01:03:06.029 --> 01:03:06.039 align:start position:0%
them thank you questions for for this
 
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else uh here that
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
wishes to be
 
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
heard all right seeing none then I'm
 
01:03:19.269 --> 01:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
going to close the uh the receipt of
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
evidence part of this um and I guess I
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
would turn it over to uh discussion
 
01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
about what if
 
01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:32.160 align:start position:0%
anything um our recommendations should
 
01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.269 align:start position:0%
anything um our recommendations should
be

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
regarding perer regarding this this
 
01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
issue representative Pearson thank you
 
01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I would put in our
 
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839 align:start position:0%
recommendations the few items that were
 
01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
previously flagged as being worthy of
 
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
inclusion in that booklet that's being
 
01:03:59.230 --> 01:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
prepared um attorney KGAN and I have
 
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
spoken of this uh on numerous occasions
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
she believes that there's a group that
 
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
would be willing to work on this but uh
 
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
to me many of the failures and some of
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
the anger come because uh individuals
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
particularly prosay
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
litigant they're not lawyers they don't
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
know these things and so they get angry
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
because why was that done why why was
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
that not done what should I have done
 
01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
differently and I realized there is some
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
information people can access ahead of
 
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
time if they are going to go prosay but
 
01:04:43.789 --> 01:04:43.799 align:start position:0%
it's been my opinion all the way that um
 
01:04:46.990 --> 01:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
there can be something uh more available
 
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
to people so I would say the couples of
 
01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
things that we looked at what are the uh
 
01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
what are the five points of proving
 
01:04:58.589 --> 01:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
perjury was one of them I forget what
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
the other one was but um uh things
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
people need to know ahead of time now
 
01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be some people
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
who are going to be angry for the simple
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
fact that they lost the case and they
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
are unwilling to believe they should
 
01:05:14.829 --> 01:05:14.839 align:start position:0%
have lost the case and no amount of
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
reasoning will work I also believe
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
there's a number of people who would be
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
mollified if they actually knew reasons
 
01:05:26.230 --> 01:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
behind things so that would be one
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation I would make for our
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
report so so point so some um and and
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
this I I have to confess my ignorance in
 
01:05:39.309 --> 01:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
the sense that I'm I'm relatively new to
 
01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
this to the overall committee I'm just I
 
01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
I was only appointed um relatively far
 
01:05:47.549 --> 01:05:47.559 align:start position:0%
along in the in the committee's work but
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
I if my if I'm understanding correctly
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
there's going to be the committee has
 
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
decided that they're going to they're
 
01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
going to recommend that there be some
 
01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.269 align:start position:0%
going to recommend that there be some
booklet

01:05:56.269 --> 01:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
booklet
 
01:05:58.269 --> 01:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
or pamphlet presented will contain
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
certain information for family L family
 
01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:03.799 align:start position:0%
court litigant is that am my
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
understanding that correctly could we
 
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
sure good morning I know that uh you've
 
01:06:19.870 --> 01:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with judge Christo
 
01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
and and she has been a little bit more
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
partial to videos that explain certain
 
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
things to litigant we find that there
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
watched we have short videos on the
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
Court's website that explain certain
 
01:06:31.789 --> 01:06:31.799 align:start position:0%
things she's younger than me that's
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
why perhaps perhaps I do not know if
 
01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
that is it but um but there was also a
 
01:06:40.109 --> 01:06:40.119 align:start position:0%
conversation we had about there are some
 
01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
things the courts can't advise private
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
parties on because we are limited in our
 
01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
ability to give direct legal advice to
 
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
the public and I did have a conversation
 
01:06:50.829 --> 01:06:50.839 align:start position:0%
with the executive director of the bar
 
01:06:52.589 --> 01:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
who is a former Circuit Court
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
Administrator about the the she has a
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
bit of fun fing for public education on
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
the law and I think often that Public
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
Funding is on things that are extremely
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
important but aspirational like for
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
example general principles of
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional law and state
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional law and I had suggested
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
to her that maybe some some of that
 
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
funding should be used for providing
 
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:13.880 align:start position:0%
public legal education on extremely
 
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
practical topics um like family law
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
which the bar is not limited in the same
 
01:07:20.589 --> 01:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
way the court is and their ability to
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
give General Legal Information to the
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
public uh that that might be a way of
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
dissin ating more information for
 
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigants uh so there
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
there are a few things that we're
 
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
looking at in terms of helping
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
self-represented litigants to understand
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
the court system but we do have some
 
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions as well sure follow up oh
 
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
yes then um you've been making a list of
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
all of the things I've been asking to be
 
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
in this encyclopedia I trust I have an
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
entire folder in my email I believe you
 
01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
do and um would it be appropriate if
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
after the session is over you Supply me
 
01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
with this person's name and contact
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
information so that I can speak and
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
encourage with executive director blet
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you yes representative
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair um what we've
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
just seen is one more example of the
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
incredible excuse me hard work that uh
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
the chair of the full committee um has
 
01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
undertaken in this regard um and but the
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
actions that um chairman Pearson's
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
talking about I believe are actions that
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
he has taken
 
01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
independently not in any way that are um
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
the result of the
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
final uh a final agreed upon version of
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
the committee report because we don't
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
have a final agreed upon version of the
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
committee report so kudos to Chairman
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
Pearson for not sitting around and
 
01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
waiting um but taking action on his own
 
01:09:04.669 --> 01:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
um I have a couple of
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh thing you're talking about Sarah blet
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am yeah
 
01:09:09.839 --> 01:09:11.709 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am yeah
um

01:09:11.709 --> 01:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:15.789 --> 01:09:15.799 align:start position:0%
uh could you tell me why since the bar
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
association is not an in independent
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
body but is part of or membership in the
 
01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:26.309 align:start position:0%
body but is part of or membership in the
bar

01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
bar
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
is part of the Supreme Court um how the
 
01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
do I think I'm trying to put my
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
theoretical underpinnings in the com in
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
the issue but the
 
01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:55.400 align:start position:0%
courts the bar is somewhat independent
 
01:09:58.270 --> 01:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
entity um it has a president it has an
 
01:10:01.590 --> 01:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
executive director um it's not directly
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
controlled by the court system so the
 
01:10:05.229 --> 01:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
difference if I I don't mean to
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
interrupt this the difference that I
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
completely misread is the difference
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
between membership in the
 
01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
bar and the bar
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
association because you can you
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
know you
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
cannot New
 
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire differs from many other states
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
where there is an independent bar there
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
is not an independent bar in New
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but you are saying that there
 
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
Association you have to be a member of
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
the bar order to practice in New
 
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and that wasn't always the
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
case and that isn't always the case in
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
every state and there there can be
 
01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
competing bars um so you and by
 
01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
practicing you are bringing yourself
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of the Supreme
 
01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
Court um but the bar association is not
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
strictly managed by the court system and
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
they do provide legal education over a
 
01:10:59.550 --> 01:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
large number of areas that's very
 
01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you very much and Sarah
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
blett um would be an excellent person to
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
um all right I I'll let the rest pass
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
for now thank you very much so I you
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
know I'm guess just I wonder if another
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with the way you've
 
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
explained I wonder if another way to put
 
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
this would be yes we have an integrated
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
bar in New Hampshire in that you need to
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
be a member of the New Hampshire Bar
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
Association to practice law in New
 
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the bar association is
 
01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
ultimately regulated by the Supreme
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
Court but the Supreme Court does not at
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
least historically has not felt that it
 
01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
has a really sort of
 
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
intrusive you know this will what this
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
is what you'll kind of do on a daily
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
basis sort of uh relationship with the
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
bar would that be a fair statement I I
 
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
think that's fair fa to say and I I I
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
guess what I would say is
 
01:11:59.709 --> 01:11:59.719 align:start position:0%
constitutionally the entire practice of
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
law has to fall under the Supreme Court
 
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
but that does not mean everyone that is
 
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
practicing law is managed by the Supreme
 
01:12:08.189 --> 01:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
Court so the bar Foundation is the court
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
is doing a lot of things that regulate
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
the practice of law in the state but
 
01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
that does not mean that the bar
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
association is directly managed by the
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
court even though uh everyone there in
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
some way might be disciplined by the
 
01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:20.679 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court for
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
misconduct um they're still they're
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
still an independent actor as many
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
people who are practicing law are
 
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
independent actors even though they're
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
answer answerable so the Supreme Court
 
01:12:29.390 --> 01:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
is the ultimate Authority on the
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
practice of law in the I mean just you
 
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
know I just give an examp just just from
 
01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
personal experience if you if your
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
experience is any different than this
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
please let us know but for all the time
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
that I was a judge in New Hampshire um
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
and and for even the longer time that I
 
01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
was a a member of member of the bar of
 
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I never remember a
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
circumstance in which the court ever for
 
01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
example had a view on like who should be
 
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
elected president of the bar association
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
or was trying to you know either
 
01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
directly or behind the scenes Lobby for
 
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
this candidate versus that candidate it
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
was to my it was always something that
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
was the bars you know they were going to
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
do whatever they were going to do and
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
the court would you know congratulate
 
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
whoever won and I I assume things have
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
not changed in that regard no they have
 
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
not the bar association functions
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
independently thank you very much if I
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
could I follow up um
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
I'm so
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
old-fashioned in so many ways including
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
um believing in three branches of
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
government and uh I know I'm stuffy and
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
all that but so let's just accept that
 
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:45.400 align:start position:0%
is I'm sitting on a legislative
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
committee not an advisory committee to
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
the judicial
 
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
branch and while I might have lots of
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
ideas about and I do about the way that
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
the court could better
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
function um I including how we
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
nominate judges which brings in another
 
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
branch of government um
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
nonetheless I
 
01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.510 align:start position:0%
nonetheless I
feel

01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
feel
 
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
restrained um in where this special
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
committee on the Family court
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
goes and what I see is that there is an
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
important role for the
 
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
legislature where the legislature has in
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
fact the Constitutional and legal
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
Authority um although it might not have
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
the financial
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
resources um to address certain
 
01:14:54.669 --> 01:14:54.679 align:start position:0%
problems I begin with the whole process
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
for how how judges are nominated well
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what we can do about that
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
but I then can see one issue that's come
 
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
up again and again and again we expect
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
Family Court judges to carry out
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult
 
01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities ideally in a limited
 
01:15:22.629 --> 01:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
period of time which doesn't work that
 
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
way and I believe we need at the moment
 
01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to have more
 
01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
judges but to have judges better
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
trained um before they um they sit in
 
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
family court and I wonder and I don't
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
know the answer to this question whether
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
it is within our Authority or not to
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
establish certain requirements
 
01:15:59.229 --> 01:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
ments for uh as part of the judicial
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
nomination process my guess is the
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
legislature can't get involved in that
 
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
but I wonder about that um I then go to
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
where judges are
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
appointed confirmed and
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
serve and I believe very strongly that
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
and we've talked about this a lot that
 
01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
there has to be a a lot more and regular
 
01:16:29.159 --> 01:16:30.669 align:start position:0%
there has to be a a lot more and regular
training

01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:30.679 align:start position:0%
training
 
01:16:35.709 --> 01:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
again I don't think that the legislature
 
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
can direct exactly what the contuct of
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
the training is but I do believe the
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
legislature could
 
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
say although I'll B it not in a time
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
when all the available money has been
 
01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
spent in advance of the
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
bium um that that there is
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh going to be an
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation to be used specifically
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
and exclusively for
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
training on a regular basis I
 
01:17:14.189 --> 01:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
believe that um it is appropriate again
 
01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:17.719 align:start position:0%
through the budget process to insist not
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
on more judges but on more clerks and
 
01:17:21.679 --> 01:17:23.310 align:start position:0%
on more judges but on more clerks and
support

01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
staff um and to have money that is must
 
01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
be used for that purpose and cannot be
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
transferred what I I'm taking too long
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
to say I know when you're all getting
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
restless is that there's very
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
little that we can do other than educate
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
ourselves about the genuine concerns
 
01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
that people have about how the court
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
system operates there's little that we
 
01:17:54.669 --> 01:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
can do in the legislative branch but
 
01:17:57.870 --> 01:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
there there are things we can do I think
 
01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
money when they say it's not the money
 
01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's the money for education
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
for training for support staff all of
 
01:18:10.629 --> 01:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
that I think is a role that we can play
 
01:18:13.629 --> 01:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
and to the extent that the work that
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
we've done for over a year now under
 
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson's leadership where we
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
have identified real concerns I think
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
that we can talk about those
 
01:18:30.750 --> 01:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
concerns and present them as something
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
that um that bears watching so to speak
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
but understanding that it's not within
 
01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
the power of the judici of the
 
01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
legislative branch to control what the
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
does so I don't know if that makes
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson unhappy or not but and
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%

01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
lot of conversations and we were very
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
much um I can't think of the technical
 
01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
term I know incahoots with each other is
 
01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
neither in law French nor current
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
collaborative collaborative thank you
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
very much uh there's a word for me to
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
learn now uh and we had a lot of
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
conversations uh we came in as an
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
outside pair of eyes and we went back
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
and forth and a lot of things happened
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
and that's wonderful I'm not sure how
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
much of that will ever get into the
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
final report of the special committee
 
01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
and how much of the final report which
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
is not an LSR it's a report how many of
 
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
those items will then become lsrs in
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
November but I very much appreciate the
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort with the Judiciary
 
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
and amongst ourselves and a lot of good
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
things uh took place so I'm not unhappy
 
01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
may I may I make a comment briefly of
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
course absolutely I have no wish to
 
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
prolong your proceedings but I I just
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
want to say that this is an extremely
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
dedicated hardworking and conscientious
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
group of legislators and we have
 
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
received a large number of excellent
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
observations and suggestions um and I'm
 
01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
thinking even of we're doing a pilot
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
program that starts in January which
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
will have uh Guardians Ed Lim we have
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
received Federal funding for Guardians
 
01:20:19.229 --> 01:20:19.239 align:start position:0%
Ed lium to get appointments in four
 
01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
different courts uh when they
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
demonstrate indigency uh which is part
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
of a suggestion a con conversation that
 
01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
we've been having in this committee uh
 
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing a pilot program on text
 
01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
notification that we're looking to
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
potentially broaden to some family
 
01:20:33.189 --> 01:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
courts based on some of the questions
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
that some legislators have had about
 
01:20:37.229 --> 01:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
notice and an email notice being missed
 
01:20:40.149 --> 01:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
um this even if it is not a question of
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
whether there is a bill that needs to be
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
brought forward the observations the the
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
the the work that this committee has
 
01:20:49.390 --> 01:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
done is is so appreciated because the
 
01:20:51.110 --> 01:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
courts want to work for the people of
 
01:20:52.750 --> 01:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we want to do the things
 
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:55.000 align:start position:0%

01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so your interest in doing
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
that and bringing forward these
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
suggestions is so appreciated um and uh
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
I I I don't find you to be the least bit
 
01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
uh stuffy or old-fashioned
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative Smith you have had some
 
01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
very very perceptive observations and we
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
have appreciated them see I missed the
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity I was going to say objection
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
facts not in evidence but I missed the
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
time all right um any other uh questions
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
or comments to this witness thank you
 
01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
very much for for being here today Mr K
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate
 
01:21:31.750 --> 01:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
it so uh yes representative so thank you
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
so um you had ask about recommendations
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
from the committee I I want to
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
underscore what um attorney cedon has
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
said I mean the conversation has been
 
01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
very valuable and I think that um the
 
01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
court is responding to things and the
 
01:21:47.709 --> 01:21:47.719 align:start position:0%
public responds to things and we
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
individually as members just be even if
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
we are not making an action item
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation I want to say personally
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
I'm very grateful to be on the committee
 
01:21:59.830 --> 01:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
I think I didn't understand the nature
 
01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
and frequency of false statements that
 
01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
are being made or the that that the
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
citizens feel they're being made and um
 
01:22:10.270 --> 01:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding that a lot better um
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
but I when I then go to the statutes and
 
01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
when I hear the testimony from the
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office or from um Tom
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
valard in his previous career I really
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
see that the statutes are very
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
significant I mean um I think that
 
01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
you know perjury is the you know
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
Hallmark and then there are other false
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
statements that are impacting the family
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
court but I think that they are
 
01:22:35.629 --> 01:22:35.639 align:start position:0%
addressed by the not only by the statute
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
but by court rules that allow the judges
 
01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
themselves either to not hear evidence
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh if they don't want to to admit if
 
01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:43.719 align:start position:0%
people aren't providing like if you
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
don't provide financial information then
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
you can't contest the financial
 
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
information on that point you know by an
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
opposing party so I I do appreciate that
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
I also um the the false stat I want to I
 
01:22:57.550 --> 01:22:57.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not a member of the collaborative
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
law Alliance right now but that is a
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
family that that's legislation that we
 
01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
will be considering this year in the
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
house I believe and it's collaborative
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
is a type of mediation that has a mental
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
health professional as part of that
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
group and some of these false statements
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
can be addressed during that process and
 
01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
you have a mental health counselor
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
really trying to help people gauge was
 
01:23:20.229 --> 01:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
it is it a lie or is it a statement you
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
don't agree with and how we can address
 
01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
that immediately going through the
 
01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:24.950 align:start position:0%
that immediately going through the
process

01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that in my experience
 
01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's arguing with my adult
 
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
children about incidents of their
 
01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
childhood it's not that I'm lying it's
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
that Our Truth is different our
 
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
perspective was different and um again
 
01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
that's not always the case and I'm glad
 
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
we have law enforcement and and statutes
 
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
and but my recommendation um really for
 
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
this committee there aren't any action
 
01:23:50.629 --> 01:23:50.639 align:start position:0%
items I think we've had a lot of
 
01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
information um I think that the judicial
 
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
education and attorney education public
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
education I mean who could not be for
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
that um you know and I I wanted to there
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
was a comment earlier about um neuro
 
01:24:05.550 --> 01:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
Divergent um Witnesses I think that's
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
very accurate I think that the bar um
 
01:24:11.070 --> 01:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
does have some some education on that I
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
I don't know if judges I assume that
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
they do but that's critical um and that
 
01:24:17.550 --> 01:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
was a good point of the the standards of
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
credibility that were using but I don't
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
think those are action items I think
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about it we've got
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
District Court represent here and um you
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
know just keeping the dialogue open um
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
and again it's an honor to be part of
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
this committee and I do apologize to
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
those my members the chair that I was
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
not here at the last meeting and that
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a quum that's a very
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
humbling embarrassing event in my life
 
01:24:43.229 --> 01:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
but anyway I hope that we can be forward
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
positive on this thank you yes
 
01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:46.550 align:start position:0%
positive on this thank you yes
representative

01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:51.149 --> 01:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I appreciate what everybody has
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
um said and I just as I'm sitting here
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
and having heard so much testimony over
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
the last two years um one of the things
 
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
that we found when we went into the cour
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
houses is that um there wasn't
 
01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily A fairness from one
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
courtroom to the next depending upon the
 
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
perspective of the judge and and I'm not
 
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
finding fault with anyone and we did put
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
legislation through that would address
 
01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
that um to make sure everyone was on the
 
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
same page but where I'm coming from is
 
01:25:26.430 --> 01:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
that necessity to make sure that
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
regardless of which Courthouse a family
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
goes to or which judge they see they
 
01:25:33.149 --> 01:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
should be coming out with the same
 
01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
outcome regardless if if everything is
 
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
the same going in it should be pretty
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
close to the same coming out and so what
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
I heard was that there was um I think if
 
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
I and clarify correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
that in the one Courthouse they may
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
follow through with a false state and
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
there may be a misdemeanor or there may
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
be something my curiosity is is that
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
happening across the state is it
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
happening and following through in all
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
the in all of the different um
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
courtrooms that when a false statement
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
is made is is it being followed through
 
01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
or is it just in that one particular
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
court I guess
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's where my head is
 
01:26:19.109 --> 01:26:19.119 align:start position:0%
always is to make sure that we have
 
01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
fairness across the board regardless of
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
which courtroom or which judge um a
 
01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
person walks into so I'd be curious to
 
01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
know in each of the cases or each of the
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
courtrooms how many of those um
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors for false statements how
 
01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
many of them are made I just I would if
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
there's a way of getting that
 
01:26:39.709 --> 01:26:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
curious I I well I'm sure we could get
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
information about like how many false
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
statement charges were brought in
 
01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
various counties and you know uh I don't
 
01:26:51.629 --> 01:26:51.639 align:start position:0%
know whether we'd be able to get the
 
01:26:53.229 --> 01:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
information of when who made the
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
referral um but you know one thing I I
 
01:26:59.950 --> 01:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
think it's really important to
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
understand is
 
01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.629 align:start position:0%
understand is
that

01:27:03.629 --> 01:27:03.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:03.639 --> 01:27:05.750 align:start position:0%
that
the

01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:11.480 align:start position:0%
Ser judges the whole thing that judges
 
01:27:15.070 --> 01:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
get paid for is to make decisions about
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
a large part of which is what is what
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
actually happened and so and often there
 
01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
are conflicting conflicting versions of
 
01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
what happened in fact if
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
I mean if there were if everybody agreed
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
on what all the facts were there
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a case in the first place so
 
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
there's there there are often
 
01:27:33.709 --> 01:27:33.719 align:start position:0%
conflicting versions of what happened
 
01:27:35.310 --> 01:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
and that that's what a judge gets paid
 
01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
for is to decide what happened I think
 
01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
what is often overlooked in this is that
 
01:27:48.189 --> 01:27:48.199 align:start position:0%
the basic remedy for false testimony is
 
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
that the judge doesn't believe the
 
01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
testimony um that's you know the whether
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
or not I mean I it would seem to me I I
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
can as a having spent 18 years as a
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
trial judge there were numerous times um
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
when I didn't believe somebody's
 
01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
testimony either because I thought it
 
01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
was a m you know they were mistaken or
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
they didn't they didn't um they didn't
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
have sufficient opportunity to observe
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
something or whatever or sometimes
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
because they were ly they were lying but
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
what what I would do and I think what
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
what I'm I'm sure other judges would do
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
what when that happened is you're not
 
01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:27.880 align:start position:0%
going to make a decision in based upon
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
something that you believe is false um
 
01:28:33.709 --> 01:28:33.719 align:start position:0%
and so that it seems to me is the basic
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
remedy for for somebody who makes a
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
false statement
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
now if it is a situation where it's
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
there's a a really
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
blatant lie that it that seems pretty
 
01:28:49.149 --> 01:28:49.159 align:start position:0%
obvious that would be able to be proved
 
01:28:52.390 --> 01:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
that it was a lie um and it's worth
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
making the referral sure but I can I
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
guess I would say you would make the
 
01:28:59.790 --> 01:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
referral but I guess I would say in 18
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
years of being a trial judge at a time
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
when we were doing family cases we it
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
was all the Superior Court handled all
 
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
the um divorce custody those kind of
 
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:15.400 align:start position:0%
cases I probably made a referral to uh
 
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
the attorney general or a county
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
attorney maybe two or three times um in
 
01:29:22.229 --> 01:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
all those years and that's not because
 
01:29:23.669 --> 01:29:23.679 align:start position:0%
it was only two or three times that
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
there was that I thought somebody was
 
01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
not being candid with me it was just
 
01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
that it you know it's not it's not
 
01:29:33.189 --> 01:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
really worth it I wasn't going to make I
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't making a decision in favor of
 
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
somebody that I thought was not telling
 
01:29:40.310 --> 01:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
the truth um and and most of the time it
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't really worth it and particularly
 
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
in family cases where there's a high
 
01:29:49.870 --> 01:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
level of conflict unless it was really
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely clear to me that it was worth
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
making the referral
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
I often thought
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
look to to now send a referral so that
 
01:30:03.390 --> 01:30:03.400 align:start position:0%
one of the parties to this family case
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
is now in addition to all the other
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
things that they're dealing with they're
 
01:30:09.189 --> 01:30:09.199 align:start position:0%
now going to have to face a criminal
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
charge that is not going to help this
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
family and so very often I would end I
 
01:30:17.229 --> 01:30:17.239 align:start position:0%
would end up you know I would simply I'd
 
01:30:20.510 --> 01:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
make my decision based upon what what I
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
found to have happened without sort of
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
complicating everybody's life by making
 
01:30:29.629 --> 01:30:29.639 align:start position:0%
a referral for for some kind of criminal
 
01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
prosecution and I I think I made the
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
right decision in do in in handling it
 
01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:37.400 align:start position:0%
that way and I suspect that most judges
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
would would would would adopt the same
 
01:30:43.109 --> 01:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
view on that that it really needs to be
 
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:46.360 align:start position:0%
very clear that there was a you know a
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
deliberate lie um that was on a serious
 
01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
matter and that was it was likely that
 
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
you were going to be able to prove that
 
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
it would that it was a that um that that
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
the LIE occurred and it was material and
 
01:31:04.109 --> 01:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
all the other elements were met and that
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
the ba the the benefit of doing that
 
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
outweighed the detriment and that was
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
often not the
 
01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:15.400 align:start position:0%
case yes representative
 
01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair let me ask you
 
01:31:19.239 --> 01:31:20.470 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair let me ask you
a

01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:31:23.950 --> 01:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
question um and I don't know which hat
 
01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
you should put on but put on one of your
 
01:31:29.950 --> 01:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
Myriad hats
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
um maybe we haven't been going about
 
01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
this the right way at
 
01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:38.750 align:start position:0%
this the right way at
all

01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
maybe the question we should be
 
01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:45.790 align:start position:0%
maybe the question we should be
asking

01:31:45.790 --> 01:31:45.800 align:start position:0%
asking
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
is do these cases
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
belong in a court at all
 
01:31:54.639 --> 01:31:55.629 align:start position:0%
belong in a court at all
is

01:31:55.629 --> 01:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
there a another way a better
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
way that we can acknowledge the state
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
interest and find the tools
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
protect every member of the
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
family understanding our particular
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility to children
 
01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
process is that throwing the baby at
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
with the bass water I mean do do do you
 
01:32:42.109 --> 01:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
see what no I I do I do see what we
 
01:32:45.229 --> 01:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
you're saying I guess I mean this is I I
 
01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:47.719 align:start position:0%
speak only for myself on this I guess I
 
01:32:50.669 --> 01:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
I think that the
 
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
that you could do that you could
 
01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:54.550 align:start position:0%
that you could do that you could
certainly

01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
have a non-c court kind of
 
01:32:57.480 --> 01:32:58.990 align:start position:0%
have a non-c court kind of
administrative

01:32:58.990 --> 01:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
process by which you would do this but I
 
01:33:04.590 --> 01:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
think the it would it would seem to
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
me um that
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure you'd gain very much
 
01:33:14.910 --> 01:33:14.920 align:start position:0%
because I I think the the the issue is
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
in a in a divorce or or where there's a
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
dispute about custody or something like
 
01:33:21.990 --> 01:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
that there's a dispute I mean people are
 
01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
not in agreement and so so when people
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
are not in
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
agreement who should have who should
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
have custody of the child when should
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
the custody be there should there be
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
some restrict people are not in
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
agreement whether it's a court or an
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
administrative agency somebody is going
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
to have to make that decision um and and
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
I think you're you're you know you so
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
you're sort of back to my my concern
 
01:33:52.629 --> 01:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
would be if let's suppose that you you
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
said we're going to handle all family
 
01:33:56.350 --> 01:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
law disputes like this in in an
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
administrative tribunal of some time of
 
01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
some type well first of all you'd have
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
to you know create that tribunal but
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
secondly I I what I'm what I think we
 
01:34:07.109 --> 01:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
would be what we would be doing is five
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
years from now we would be having we be
 
01:34:12.109 --> 01:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
having a hearing about whether you know
 
01:34:16.189 --> 01:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
why is there why is there perjury in the
 
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
in the administrative processes in the
 
01:34:20.910 --> 01:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
you know before the Department of Health
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
and Human Services or or whatever so I'm
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
and I and I so I I think that's would be
 
01:34:28.830 --> 01:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
part of my answer and the other part of
 
01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
my answer would be I I do
 
01:34:32.679 --> 01:34:36.350 align:start position:0%
my answer would be I I do
think

01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
that whatever you know whatever changes
 
01:34:41.629 --> 01:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
might be made and I'm not and I'm not
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
certainly not suggesting that that I
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
think it our selection process is
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
perfect I don't think that's true but I
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
guess I would say I think that the
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
care with which judges are selected now
 
01:34:58.750 --> 01:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
and probably I'd say going back to
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
really when Governor Shaheen was uh was
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
governor and and I think she might have
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
been the first one to begin to use the
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
judicial selection commissions and I
 
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
think every Governor since then has um I
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
think that the care with which judges
 
01:35:17.790 --> 01:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
are selected is at least as good and
 
01:35:21.310 --> 01:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
probably better than the the process by
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
which administrative officials are are
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
selected and so that you know that gives
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
me some comfort thank
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
you representative B thank you again um
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
I just want to make a clarification in
 
01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:38.440 align:start position:0%
my question or my observation I'm was
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
not finding fault with the judges what I
 
01:35:44.590 --> 01:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
was trying to make the point is what
 
01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
happens as it was brought up what's
 
01:35:48.390 --> 01:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
happening in the statements that are
 
01:35:50.910 --> 01:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
made before it even enters the courtroom
 
01:35:53.910 --> 01:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
that's my concern and that's where it's
 
01:35:56.669 --> 01:35:56.679 align:start position:0%
like well how do we keep
 
01:35:58.830 --> 01:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
them just to put it in the words that
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
the people who came forward over the
 
01:36:04.270 --> 01:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
last few years how do we keep the
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
weaponization out of the courtroom
 
01:36:08.109 --> 01:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
that's the point I'm trying to get when
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
people are making these false claims and
 
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm saying and then they find
 
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
out their false claims what is what is
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
the consequence and that those are not
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
being brought into the courtroom as we
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
said can then drag out the court and in
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
the meantime the parents are losing
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
access to their children or just the
 
01:36:29.669 --> 01:36:29.679 align:start position:0%
person who's had the false claims made
 
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
against them just what's happening to
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
the reputation and that's where I'm
 
01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
getting concerned it's not that I'm
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
finding a fault with the judge or
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
anything it's how do we take the steps
 
01:36:44.350 --> 01:36:44.360 align:start position:0%
before it even reaches to assure that um
 
01:36:46.750 --> 01:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
there's fairness for everyone and and
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
like I guess that's and I apologize for
 
01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
if I if I made it sound like I was
 
01:36:53.950 --> 01:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
Finding fault with the No No I I didn't
 
01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
interpret that way and I don't and in no
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
way take take offense of I I I didn't
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
interpret it that way but I guess I
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
think what what I'm sort of saying is
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
that even even in the you know in the
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
situation of somebody who fire who has
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
filed a complaint um and the claim is
 
01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:18.679 align:start position:0%
the claim is that well it was false I'm
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
it often is not it it is often not the
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
situation that everybody agrees it was
 
01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
false the you know it's it it I think
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
it's relative it's a relatively rare
 
01:37:34.149 --> 01:37:34.159 align:start position:0%
situation where the person who makes the
 
01:37:36.149 --> 01:37:36.159 align:start position:0%
false claim has kind of now conf I'm not
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
saying it never happens I think it does
 
01:37:39.629 --> 01:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
happen but it's relatively rare that
 
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:41.639 align:start position:0%
that person is saying yep you know I did
 
01:37:44.709 --> 01:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
I lied it's usually somebody else is
 
01:37:47.589 --> 01:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
saying no that was not true um and you
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
know my my child was taken away for some
 
01:37:52.990 --> 01:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
period of time because somebody in this
 
01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
case you probably talking about somebody
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
at DCF believed that it was true um uh
 
01:38:02.310 --> 01:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
but the person who made the com
 
01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
complaint is is in all likelihood is is
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
still saying it was true and so somebody
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
you know it's a it I guess what I'm
 
01:38:12.510 --> 01:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
really saying it's a decision somebody
 
01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
has to make a decision was this true or
 
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
not true
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
and that that is often not an easy
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
decision to make that that's really kind
 
01:38:26.550 --> 01:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
of what I'm saying it's not it
 
01:38:30.229 --> 01:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
it we're get I think one of the things
 
01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
that is a problem in
 
01:38:35.629 --> 01:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
these in this area
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
is we get we
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
get information from people who have one
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
who have a perspective from one side of
 
01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
a case and they may be entire understand
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting for a moment that
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
those people are
 
01:39:00.149 --> 01:39:00.159 align:start position:0%
lying I'm just saying that we when when
 
01:39:03.149 --> 01:39:03.159 align:start position:0%
we're asked to make decisions based upon
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
that I think it's important to that we
 
01:39:11.629 --> 01:39:11.639 align:start position:0%
that we factor in about what we're going
 
01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
to do that there may be another side of
 
01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:16.270 align:start position:0%
to do that there may be another side of
the

01:39:16.270 --> 01:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
story that we haven't heard and that's I
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
whereas the decision maker in that
 
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's the court or dcyf or
 
01:39:29.310 --> 01:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
whatever they often have
 
01:39:33.629 --> 01:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
heard the whole story and so they're you
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
know they may I think we need to we need
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
to factor that in to as to
 
01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
whether what action we're going to take
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
heard we got to write a report
 
01:39:56.189 --> 01:39:56.199 align:start position:0%
I guess what you know
 
01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
I here's what my inclination would be in
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
terms of a subcommittee report is to
 
01:40:09.149 --> 01:40:09.159 align:start position:0%
say there is there's no question that
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
Ury from time to time happens in family
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
law cases as it does in other cases and
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
and it may even be true that there's
 
01:40:19.589 --> 01:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
more of it in family law cases because
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
those are you know I would be the first
 
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
to admit those are the highest conflict
 
01:40:26.109 --> 01:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
kinds of cases there's no question that
 
01:40:28.750 --> 01:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
the people people especially where
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
children are involved people are you
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
know uh that's that's
 
01:40:39.149 --> 01:40:39.159 align:start position:0%
where emotions can run the highest
 
01:40:39.159 --> 01:40:40.990 align:start position:0%
where emotions can run the highest
um

01:40:40.990 --> 01:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:45.589 --> 01:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
and but in terms of what
 
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
legislative actions we can take I I
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
would I have absolutely no issue
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
whatsoever chair Pearson with the idea
 
01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
of you know providing more information
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
to litigants um if we can you know I I
 
01:41:01.629 --> 01:41:01.639 align:start position:0%
as I say I'm a little bit late to the
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
process of what all the what all the
 
01:41:06.189 --> 01:41:06.199 align:start position:0%
points that you and Miss crean have been
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
talking about that would go into a a a
 
01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
booklet or pamphlet or but I certainly
 
01:41:14.109 --> 01:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
have no problem
 
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
with having something be put in there
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
concerning like what is what are the
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
elements of the crimes that uh that um
 
01:41:25.709 --> 01:41:25.719 align:start position:0%
can result from somebody making a false
 
01:41:28.109 --> 01:41:28.119 align:start position:0%
statement whether in court or in some
 
01:41:31.149 --> 01:41:31.159 align:start position:0%
other official proceedings as uh or or
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh documents that are filed and with
 
01:41:36.189 --> 01:41:36.199 align:start position:0%
dcyf or whatever as Mr valard pointed
 
01:41:40.109 --> 01:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
out and I also um completely agree with
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
uh with representative Smith on the you
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
know the advisability of having better
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
training and uh Educational Services for
 
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
judges with the caveat that you I think
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
you also recognized is
 
01:41:55.149 --> 01:41:55.159 align:start position:0%
I think this is going to be a
 
01:41:59.550 --> 01:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
challenging bium budget-wise um but to
 
01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
the extent that uh that that is
 
01:42:04.750 --> 01:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
something that is doable I'm completely
 
01:42:08.430 --> 01:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
on board with that Mr chairman um I
 
01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
don't know if you took the opportunity
 
01:42:14.109 --> 01:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
to read the reports of previous
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
committees like this one um I have
 
01:42:21.149 --> 01:42:21.159 align:start position:0%
others have I think the report that we
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
will be voting on a week from two
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
Tuesday uh is something that will be
 
01:42:29.229 --> 01:42:29.239 align:start position:0%
looked at will be cited will be
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
informational to five or six years from
 
01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
now when another special committee is
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
formed and much of what goes into
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
eventually seven different subcommittees
 
01:42:45.070 --> 01:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
we've done four reports three are in the
 
01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
process of winding up is to say we met
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
we looked at these things here's some
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
things we
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
find uh uh should be known wider a field
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
some of these are aspirational some of
 
01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
them are educational some of them may
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
turn into
 
01:43:05.709 --> 01:43:05.719 align:start position:0%
lsrs not from the committee but from
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
individuals perhaps on the committee or
 
01:43:10.030 --> 01:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
even outside the committee that we sign
 
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
on as co-sponsors or what have you so
 
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
the report should really kind of reflect
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
the work we've done here and as I say
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
some of it is educational I think some
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
of it's
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
aspirational uh when the pot of gold has
 
01:43:26.189 --> 01:43:26.199 align:start position:0%
been discovered here are certain things
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
that we would now suggest we actually go
 
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
do and and so on so I think that's what
 
01:43:34.750 --> 01:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
we would need from this group before we
 
01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
adjourn is a report that's uh brief like
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
that but has something to say not just
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
to people reading it now but down the
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
road all
 
01:43:51.629 --> 01:43:51.639 align:start position:0%
right other uh comments um so I will um
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
I will try to uh put something together
 
01:43:58.189 --> 01:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
sort of uh summarizing what we have just
 
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
discussed and I I know we're having
 
01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
final committee meeting on October 22nd
 
01:44:06.270 --> 01:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
I think y um and I I'll make sure I
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
circulated to the subcommittee you know
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
it'll uh it'll be it'll be short and to
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
the point uh but I'll try to do that as
 
01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible you know I just
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
would make one other point on that
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
particularly since we're we're focusing
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
on perjury I think that um
 
01:44:28.149 --> 01:44:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's point about the
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
um judicial selection and that kind of
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
thing is really important because it
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
seems to me that there's a lot of things
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
that I think
 
01:44:41.589 --> 01:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
training uh and education of Judges is
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
very important on I'm not sure that the
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
issue of perjury is one of those and
 
01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:48.950 align:start position:0%
issue of perjury is one of those and
that's

01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me it seems to me in
 
01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:55.719 align:start position:0%
that the question of deciding what
 
01:44:58.189 --> 01:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
happened who's telling me the truth and
 
01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
who's not who's being accurate and who's
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
not being accurate who is lying
 
01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
deliberately lying or
 
01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure that there's a lot of
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
training quote unquote that you can get
 
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
to decide that that's really based on
 
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
your life experience I mean you get that
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
kind of training in raising a child and
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
when they say you know when you say what
 
01:45:25.229 --> 01:45:25.239 align:start position:0%
happened uh where did that cookie go um
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh and you get an answer and you you
 
01:45:29.470 --> 01:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
know over life you you begin to and when
 
01:45:32.510 --> 01:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
you go into the grocery store and you
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
know say what happened to somebody tells
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
you uh uh there's been a change in price
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
and why or whatever um all those things
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
in life are what kind of trains you to
 
01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
make those kind of decisions and that's
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
why I think you know as a as a very good
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
colleague of mine uh I'm I'm H I'm
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
really proud to say she my my my former
 
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
colleague judge Conboy would say that's
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
why most of the time it's a good idea
 
01:46:03.550 --> 01:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
for judges to have some gray hair before
 
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
they get appointed because they've had
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
some experience in life and they've
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
they're in a better position to be
 
01:46:12.589 --> 01:46:12.599 align:start position:0%
making decisions about who's telling the
 
01:46:14.430 --> 01:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
truth and who's lying and understanding
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
human motivations so that uh on the
 
01:46:19.709 --> 01:46:19.719 align:start position:0%
issue of perjury I think that that's
 
01:46:29.589 --> 01:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
so you will be pulling all of this
 
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
together sending it out to us for
 
01:46:37.149 --> 01:46:37.159 align:start position:0%
comments back to you so the final report
 
01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
will officially appear on the 22nd and
 
01:46:43.709 --> 01:46:43.719 align:start position:0%
we will then vote on
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
it but the members of the committee will
 
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
see the draft of that before the 22nd I
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
should hope so I would hope so
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
too all right is there anything else uh
 
01:47:00.709 --> 01:47:00.719 align:start position:0%
that we need to discuss I will try to
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
get a draft out
 
01:47:07.870 --> 01:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
um by early next week anyway um uh and
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
I'll circulate it you know to the
 
01:47:12.709 --> 01:47:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:15.310 --> 01:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
committee the
 
01:47:18.910 --> 01:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
I no I have not reading the interim
 
01:47:21.830 --> 01:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
report kind of gives the form of what
 
01:47:24.270 --> 01:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
the other three reports could possibly
 
01:47:26.669 --> 01:47:26.679 align:start position:0%
look like they vary in length and
 
01:47:28.589 --> 01:47:28.599 align:start position:0%
intensity and so on but they sort of
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
have a family relationship to each other
 
01:47:34.270 --> 01:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
uh so we have four interim reports uh
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
four reports in the interim report and
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
we will be adding three more and they
 
01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
could be like unto it oh sure sure know
 
01:47:43.830 --> 01:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
will you can you send those to me can
 
01:47:47.229 --> 01:47:47.239 align:start position:0%
you uh uh well that involves computers
 
01:47:49.470 --> 01:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll delegate that to somebody
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
all right thank you all right anything
 
01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:54.270 align:start position:0%
all right thank you all right anything
else

01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:47:56.189 --> 01:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm going to close
