00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the

committee I'm Carol McGuire of Merrimack
 
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 align:start position:0%
District 27 and this bill was a request
 
00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 align:start position:0%
of the administrative rulemaking
 
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
department and
 
00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 align:start position:0%
I want to start out by saying it does
 
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
not authorize any remote or hybrid
 
00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
meetings that are not otherwise
 
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
authorized in law
 
00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
it simply says that if you are
 
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
authorized to hold such a meeting and
 
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
you choose to do so these are the
 
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
require these are things you have to do
 
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the public is properly
 
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
notified and pro and can participate
 
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
um there
 
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
the hybrid meetings are already allowed
 
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
if you have a physical Quorum in one in
 
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 align:start position:0%
one location and members may come in
 
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.070 align:start position:0%
one location and members may come in
um

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
in addition to the members who are in
 
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
the physical location remote meetings
 
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
are not currently authorized
 
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 align:start position:0%
in general but I know that some of them
 
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
have been happening and we this bill is
 
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
an attempt to make sure that the
 
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.790 align:start position:0%
an attempt to make sure that the
um

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
that the rules are followed the public
 
00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 align:start position:0%
is informed and that they can
 
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 align:start position:0%
participate and I won't try to answer
 
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
any questions no
 
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
this is essentially what was done under
 
00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
the emergency rules in 20 and 21. uh
 
00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
with a little polishing
 
00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 align:start position:0%
as we learned what happened
 
00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.710 align:start position:0%

you're just clarifying what should be
happening

and respect of time
 
00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:26.750 align:start position:0%
and respect of time
during

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
during
 
00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
last year we passed Senate bill 330. and
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 330 was created as a study
 
00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
committee to explore oplc in ways we
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
could try to help the agency become more
 
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
efficient and things that they're
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
struggling with in order to overcome
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
some of the barriers
 
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
part of that process was to look at
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
communication and one of the things I
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
heard during the testimony over several
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
weeks from various boards was the
 
00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.650 align:start position:0%
weeks from various boards was the
challenge

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
in trying to get notification of
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
meetings and the documents being shared
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
in the public session
 
00:48:11.089 --> 00:48:11.099 align:start position:0%
so what this bill simply does is it
 
00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:14.220 align:start position:0%
places a requirement in oplc
 
00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:17.819 align:start position:0%
that the board a commission or a council
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
simply has to under 91a
 
00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:23.089 align:start position:0%
simply has to under 91a
notify

00:48:23.089 --> 00:48:23.099 align:start position:0%
notify
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
a meeting 14 days before the meeting but
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
also requires that any government
 
00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.410 align:start position:0%
also requires that any government
records

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
are made available to the public seven
 
00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
days before the meeting
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
now I'll give you a little bit of
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
History I was underwater Pharmacy for
 
00:48:41.089 --> 00:48:41.099 align:start position:0%
over 10 years 10 years actually
 
00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:44.700 align:start position:0%
10 years a month and during that time
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
be on the board as a member of the board
 
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
I received all the documents because as
 
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
a board member you have to see them
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
before the meeting otherwise you won't
 
00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:56.339 align:start position:0%
have time to reflect on them digest them
 
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
I didn't realize to the public when I
 
00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
was sitting on the board how difficult
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
it was for them
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
when I came off the board
 
00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:10.140 align:start position:0%
I quickly realized how challenging it
 
00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
was because the boards up there talking
 
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
about documents it's like we're doing
 
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
today and the Public's going what are
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
they talking about
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
and where's my ability to comment on
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
what's being passed so what this bill
 
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
simply does is put a requirement that
 
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
any agency or commission or counsel
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
or board under the lp PLC
 
00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.050 align:start position:0%
or board under the lp PLC
um

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:43.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
one of the things I noticed in
 
00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
preparation for the meeting today
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
there's a drafting error I should have
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
caught it earlier I did not and why I
 
00:49:55.849 --> 00:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
bring this to your attention is if you
 
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
if you look at where
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
OLS place the document I should have
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
caught this and I didn't and I was what
 
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
caught my attention was why is oplc
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:22.380 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note of 330 311 000 it didn't
 
00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
make sense
 
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
but then I went back and looked at where
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
the attorneys placed the bill in the RSA
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
and if you look at one where it's in the
 
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
bill now
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
it is in section 310 A1
 
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
I thought that was a11 it's A1 l
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
and if you look at a1l it deals with
 
00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:50.579 align:start position:0%
hearings decisions and appeals
 
00:50:52.609 --> 00:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
which was never the intent of what I
 
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to accomplish
 
00:50:56.569 --> 00:50:56.579 align:start position:0%
when you get into a hearing a particular
 
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearing the documents that
 
00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:00.599 align:start position:0%
are shared with the board are relatively
 
00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
private and are legally binding so
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
therefore to release those documents to
 
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
the public before the board meeting
 
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
would be problematic without having a
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
legal review
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
what I recommend to this committee and
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
I'd be more than glad to make the
 
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
amendment and give it to one of the
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
members on the committee as we move it
 
00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
from 310 1
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
L to 310 1
 
00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.750 align:start position:0%
L to 310 1
a1d

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
a1d
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
d as in David
 
00:51:34.609 --> 00:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
I think that's the more appropriate
 
00:51:37.490 --> 00:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
place for the bill to reside it doesn't
 
00:51:39.950 --> 00:51:39.960 align:start position:0%
and I would also talk to
 
00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:42.900 align:start position:0%
executive director Lindsay Courtney to
 
00:51:45.049 --> 00:51:45.059 align:start position:0%
work with her she has some concerns
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
about maybe some other things that may
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
have to be amended within the bill
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
to specifically exclude hearings and
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
disciplines because the bill doesn't
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
currently address that it only deals
 
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
with emergencies and deals with
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
non-public but this is probably
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
something that should be excluded as
 
00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.089 align:start position:0%
something that should be excluded as
well

00:52:02.089 --> 00:52:02.099 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
so that's my testimony for you today and
 
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
why I'm here before you is to basically
 
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
I'm a strong believer that transparency
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
is important
 
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
that any government entity
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
should as much as possible
 
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
inform the public what they're deciding
 
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
and let them know what's going on
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
I believe in transparency I think we
 
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
have a right to know what a government's
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
doing I think the government has an
 
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
obligation to inform us of what they're
 
00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:34.140 align:start position:0%
thinking of doing so that's the intent
 
00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:35.579 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions
 
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
yes representative Brian thank you Mr
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
Merchant for taking my question uh
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
starting with line 9 section eight
 
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
uh basically councils and commissions
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
can take public comment uh but what
 
00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:03.059 align:start position:0%
isn't written down and should it be the
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
amount of time
 
00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
allowed for public comment uh case in
 
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
point that I'm getting at in Nashua I'm
 
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
also on the board of alderman we give
 
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
the public three minutes and we hope
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
that they're concise and to the point
 
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:20.460 align:start position:0%
but that's uh a trait that not is not
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
really out there in everybody in public
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
speaking so I'm just wondering if the
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
concern I would hate to see a meeting
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
tied up for an extremely amount of time
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
wraps up O'Brien I totally concur I
 
00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
think it's a good point I'd be more than
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
glad to incorporate that into an
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
amendment that I'll have either before
 
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
the committee or somebody on this
 
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
committee to introduce on my behalf do
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
you have recommendation to three minutes
 
00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
um my concern has listened to what
 
00:53:49.849 --> 00:53:49.859 align:start position:0%
you're saying is
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
is it three minutes per person or should
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
it be a block of time that the chair can
 
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
divvy amongst people because you could
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
have 20 people there
 
00:54:01.609 --> 00:54:01.619 align:start position:0%
we're three minutes each which is an
 
00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
hour so is it better to give up to 30
 
00:54:06.049 --> 00:54:06.059 align:start position:0%
minutes to let the chair decide how to
 
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
allocate that time
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%
if I make you may uh in the example of
 
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
Nashua everybody's entitled individually
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
to the three minutes if it takes
 
00:54:19.609 --> 00:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
five hours unfortunately but that's what
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
the whole point of at least three
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
minutes is to try to avoid although we
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage if somebody else did
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
mention something you can get up and
 
00:54:32.809 --> 00:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
reaffirm that you agree with that point
 
00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
of view to expedite the matter but
 
00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:38.339 align:start position:0%
you're again relying on the good nature
 
00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
of people thank you
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lucas thank you
 
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:45.650 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lucas thank you
um

00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
looking at uh at lines um at the part on
 
00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:53.220 align:start position:0%
the public comment uh 12 to 14.
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
um unless I'm missing something it only
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
says to submit written comments I don't
 
00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
see anything that would give people the
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
ability to testify in front of anything
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
is that am I missing something
 
00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:07.700 align:start position:0%
right about that
 
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative said I think oh at the
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
section above it yes yes
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
ah okay thank you sorry and do you have
 
00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:18.900 align:start position:0%
a preference on time allocation do you
 
00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
think a three minute time allocation per
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
person is reasonable or should be some
 
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
other follow-up if I can answer them um
 
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I would go more with
 
00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
I mean you might you might set a minimum
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
people can do but I I however you set
 
00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:35.220 align:start position:0%
the rules I think the the chair needs
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
the ability to allow it to be extended
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
because you may have somebody with some
 
00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
expertise that you really want to hear
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
what they have to say and it might take
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
more than three minutes rather than just
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
having a pile of people from the general
 
00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
public commenting
 
00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative O'Brien thank you um
 
00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
and I'll ask you to form a question to
 
00:55:58.970 --> 00:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant uh what you are
 
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
actually talking about is somebody from
 
00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
the public getting up and making a
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
comment on what's going on what's being
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
presented on the agenda uh isn't so much
 
00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:12.059 align:start position:0%
it is a difference between a public
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
comment and somebody somebody offering
 
00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
testimony on the on a particular
 
00:56:19.849 --> 00:56:19.859 align:start position:0%
procedure to which if somebody's
 
00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
offering testimony then it is a widely
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
way that you want that information and
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
the time is given to that person for the
 
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
testimony is that the agreement
 
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
the testimony would not have a limit per
 
00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
se that would be totally under the
 
00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:39.500 align:start position:0%
control of the chair this is more to
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
allow people in the audience the public
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
to testify not testify but to speak on
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
behalf they share the concerns if you
 
00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:47.210 align:start position:0%
behalf they share the concerns if you
will

00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
before the board
 
00:56:52.730 --> 00:56:52.740 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lucas actually on a
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
different topic and and maybe Lindsay be
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
better to answer this but it says there
 
00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:00.059 align:start position:0%
shall be you know notif notice um
 
00:57:03.170 --> 00:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
certain amount of time in advance
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
um so what happens if a board manages
 
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
not to give that notice does that mean
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
they they have to cancel the hearing and
 
00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:12.059 align:start position:0%
until they do my understanding under 91a
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
a meeting is not appropriately noticed
 
00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:16.740 align:start position:0%
you cannot have the meeting okay thank
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
you that's a 91a requirement
 
00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.930 align:start position:0%
you that's a 91a requirement
representative

00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:22.940 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh representative
 
00:57:27.650 --> 00:57:27.660 align:start position:0%
Merchant I'm
 
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill and it says that
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
your Amendment starts after Roman
 
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
numeral six
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
but the handout that you gave us ends at
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral five and I'm looking in my
 
00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:46.140 align:start position:0%
tablet at this current statute that says
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
it was amended in for July of 2022 and
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
there's no Roman numeral six there
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
either is there something
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
are you referring to yeah representative
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
are you looking at 310 a colon 1
 
00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
L Dash D D no I'm what I'm suggesting is
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
right now where it's
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
where it lies is in 310
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
a colon 1 L the L I took is a one and
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
that's where my confusion was and it
 
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
wasn't until this morning when I went
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
back and looked at my notes and I was
 
00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
trying to understand why there'd be a
 
00:58:32.089 --> 00:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
physical note of 311 thousand dollars
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's when I realized it's in the
 
00:58:36.170 --> 00:58:36.180 align:start position:0%
hearing and discipline section and I
 
00:58:37.609 --> 00:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
think we should move it from there into
 
00:58:37.619 --> 00:58:38.630 align:start position:0%
think we should move it from there into
the

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
um hyphen a colon 1 D in that section
 
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
so be added there at the bottom
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
may cut it may come I'll talk to the
 
00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
attorneys down in OLS but I think it's
 
00:58:56.089 --> 00:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
going to come down to adding at that
 
00:58:58.609 --> 00:58:58.619 align:start position:0%
point in time where it says five
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
making this done a six and going through
 
00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
it that way okay well that was my point
 
00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
the the amendment I mean the bill is
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
worded incorrectly correct if you're
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
amending D yes it is that that was my
 
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
00:59:19.609 --> 00:59:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
the chair would like to call executive
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:59:35.569 --> 00:59:35.579 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair uh for the record my name is
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
Lindsey Courtney I'm the executive
 
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
director of The Office of professional
 
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
Ace insurance certification thank you to
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for hearing my
 
00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
um oplc does not take an official
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
position on this bill we certainly
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
support the intent of the bill which is
 
00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:53.339 align:start position:0%
to promote public transparency
 
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
practically in the office we have done
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
what we can to promote transparency
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
since the state of emergency ended we've
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
continued to live stream our meetings to
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
provide greater access to members of the
 
01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.170 align:start position:0%
provide greater access to members of the
public

01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:08.180 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
most of our boards do allow opportunity
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
for comment for members of the public
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
that's considered best practice
 
01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
and we we fully support the intent of
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
this bill to codify that we do have some
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
concerns with the way it's drafted and
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
we would be happy to collaborate and
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
work with representative Merchant to
 
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
address some of those concerns if
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
appropriate namely we just want to make
 
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
sure that there is some language that
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
allows boards to convene a quorum
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
if the need arises but doesn't actually
 
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements for an emergency
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
meeting I'll give you a prime example
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
right now we have a 24 hour require
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
environment for notice purposes under
 
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.250 align:start position:0%
environment for notice purposes under
91a

01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:57.260 align:start position:0%
91a
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we run into Workforce issues
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
members of the healthcare industry in
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
particular need to get licensed boards
 
01:01:08.089 --> 01:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
occasionally still review applications
 
01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon for board to convene a
 
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
meeting on a couple of days notice for
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
example to review a licensure
 
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
application so that person can start
 
01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:21.299 align:start position:0%
working we just want to make sure that
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
the 14-day requirement is not impeding
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
the state's ability to conduct business
 
01:01:30.289 --> 01:01:30.299 align:start position:0%
and get work done as it's worded that
 
01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:32.339 align:start position:0%
circumstance wouldn't be permitted we
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
would need to notice a meeting 14 days
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
in advance so that could be problematic
 
01:01:39.289 --> 01:01:39.299 align:start position:0%
from a Workforce Workforce standpoint
 
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
the other concern I have practically is
 
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
that many of our boards that review
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
licensing applications do review them in
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
public session they are able to do that
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
provided you know the discussion would
 
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
not reasonably impact a person other
 
01:01:59.450 --> 01:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
than a board member so when we have
 
01:02:02.270 --> 01:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
these confidential documents that
 
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
they're discussing they're not revealing
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
confidential information but there's uh
 
01:02:08.109 --> 01:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
there's accompanying documentation
 
01:02:10.319 --> 01:02:11.990 align:start position:0%
there's accompanying documentation
transcripts

01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
transcripts
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
we would not obviously be able to
 
01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
release all of the information on the
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
application and so it would require
 
01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
extensive effort on our part to redact
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
all that information so that could slow
 
01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:25.619 align:start position:0%
things down and I think
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
um you know there could be an alternate
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
solution you know maybe boards shouldn't
 
01:02:31.069 --> 01:02:31.079 align:start position:0%
be reviewing applications in public
 
01:02:31.079 --> 01:02:32.569 align:start position:0%
be reviewing applications in public
session

01:02:32.569 --> 01:02:32.579 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
um but I I do want to bring that to the
 
01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
committee's attention that practically
 
01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:38.339 align:start position:0%
that that would be somewhat difficult
 
01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:40.099 align:start position:0%
for us to implement
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
those are our
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
primary concerns and comments again
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
we're happy to work with representative
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
Merchant um if he so desires any sort of
 
01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:53.220 align:start position:0%
changes and I'd be happy to take any
 
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.950 align:start position:0%
changes and I'd be happy to take any
questions

01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative likes thank you um I
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
can't speak for chair McGuire but I
 
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
suspect this would end up going to a
 
01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that deals with licensing
 
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:12.059 align:start position:0%
from behind the curtain she speaks
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
um so what I would suggest is that you
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
know you'll be involved in that and
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
maybe come with
 
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.410 align:start position:0%
maybe come with
um

01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
some suggested language for things you'd
 
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
like to see to be considered especially
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
concerning um
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know I I want it's important to have
 
01:03:31.609 --> 01:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
the meetings and to require that they be
 
01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
held leaving too big a loophole to be
 
01:03:36.289 --> 01:03:36.299 align:start position:0%
able to hold a meeting without the
 
01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
notice is problematic so I don't know
 
01:03:39.890 --> 01:03:39.900 align:start position:0%
where the line would be drawn on that
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
but you might have some ideas excellent
 
01:03:43.849 --> 01:03:43.859 align:start position:0%
well do you representative
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien uh thank you Mr
 
01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:49.140 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you director for
 
01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:53.099 align:start position:0%
taking my question I know in my job as
 
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
an alderman we have had situations
 
01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:57.420 align:start position:0%
particularly when we discuss Personnel
 
01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
issues and other events that we go into
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
a non-public and 91a does have a clause
 
01:04:07.069 --> 01:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
in that that allows it to go in and then
 
01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
we'll usually traditionally to protect
 
01:04:12.589 --> 01:04:12.599 align:start position:0%
everybody involved make a decision to
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
seal the minutes and they shall stay
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
sealed until sometime at some point
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
the majority of the board determines
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
that to release it do you still do you
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
have that right
 
01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
we do
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
um certain boards exercise it
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
differently certain boards are more
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
comfortable reviewing for example
 
01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
licensing applications in public session
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
versus others review them all in
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
non-public I think an argument can be
 
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
made both ways if there's nothing on the
 
01:04:48.490 --> 01:04:48.500 align:start position:0%
application that is problematic
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
it probably shouldn't be reviewed and
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
non-public because
 
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
um it may not meet that exemption
 
01:04:59.950 --> 01:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
criteria under 91a I think it's five
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
so we certainly have that capability
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's just different boards exercise it
 
01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.150 align:start position:0%
it's just different boards exercise it
differently

01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
differently
 
01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.930 align:start position:0%
differently
foreign

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:08.940 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:05:11.809 --> 01:05:11.819 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gerhard thank you
 
01:05:11.819 --> 01:05:14.030 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gerhard thank you
chairman

01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
question for you when you're redacting
 
01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
stuff how is the process done is it I
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
mean to me it seems like there's only
 
01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:22.200 align:start position:0%
certain fields on a document that would
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
have personal information and it so
 
01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
isn't just a magic marker and boom boom
 
01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
boom done we all have Adobe Pro
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
um so we utilize an electronic method
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
for redaction some of our boards review
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
many many documents so it does require
 
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
some of our boards you know like
 
01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
Foresters for example they may have 10
 
01:05:44.089 --> 01:05:44.099 align:start position:0%
documents to review some of our boards
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
like Pharmacy they have a lot of
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
documents that need to be reviewed so it
 
01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
depends on the board what the volume
 
01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:50.579 align:start position:0%
would look like
 
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
but so follow up yes so a member of the
 
01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
public could do a 91a request and get
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
these documents and they'd be redacted
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
at that point correct yep absolutely and
 
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this may be another
 
01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
question for
 
01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:12.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor's testimony uh it appears that
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
although this bill is marked as an early
 
01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
Bill perhaps that's not really accurate
 
01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if there's enough
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
time to make the
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
corrections to the language if it has to
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
go to finance
 
01:06:53.569 --> 01:06:53.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah just for clarification on
 
01:06:58.490 --> 01:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
that if that gets moved to section D
 
01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:00.299 align:start position:0%
does that eliminate the fiscal note
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
reduce the fiscal note
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
I think it would reduce the difficult no
 
01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
I think we would still have
 
01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
um a need for staff support on we would
 
01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:11.579 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that somebody's
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
reviewing all materials before they're
 
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
publicly posted
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
um we do presently have technologically
 
01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
and we're exploring this the capability
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
of posting all public documentation
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
because we're using a different platform
 
01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
I'm a little hesitant to roll it out
 
01:07:30.170 --> 01:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
because with a click of a button you
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
could reveal information and we need to
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have internal controls
 
01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
in place prior to doing that so
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
um we would it would make me feel more
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable if we had staff review
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
additional staff review prior to posting
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
information on the web okay
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:07:50.809 --> 01:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
you know thank you director appreciate
 
01:07:50.819 --> 01:07:52.490 align:start position:0%
you know thank you director appreciate
it

01:07:52.490 --> 01:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh the chair would like to call Bill
 
01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:03.890 align:start position:0%
uh the chair would like to call Bill
Trombley

01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chair good morning good
 
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
morning committee uh I my name is Bill
 
01:08:11.329 --> 01:08:11.339 align:start position:0%
Trombley Jr I'm from Manchester New
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm representing the
 
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
plumbers and fuel gas Fitters
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire and we are
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill and uh as I'm
 
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony something
 
01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:27.980 align:start position:0%
simple turns complicated I guess
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
the main thing is that we're looking for
 
01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
is board meetings we're not looking for
 
01:08:35.410 --> 01:08:35.420 align:start position:0%
emergency meetings we're not looking for
 
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
hearings or anything else like that
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
um some um you know I was the chairman
 
01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:44.460 align:start position:0%
of the mechanical board for over 11 12
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
years and didn't see a problem because I
 
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
was at every meeting as I left the the
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
meeting uh the chair I uh a couple of
 
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
times drive up from Manchester which is
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
not that big of a travel but the meeting
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
is is not going on or it went on earlier
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
it went on yesterday
 
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
didn't happen it doesn't happen a lot
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
but it it it's happened and
 
01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
um I think with posting the meeting 14
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
days ahead of time is something that is
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
really needed now
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
um our members and it's it's great that
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
these meetings are are remote and
 
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
um I have uh have now gone to listening
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
to the uh meetings by remote unless I'm
 
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
up in the up in this area
 
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
um the one thing that is um with those
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
uh meetings is that the information that
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
is going on in the meeting is not is not
 
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
readily available it's not posted yes
 
01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
after the meeting I can I can ask for it
 
01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
or maybe I should ask for it before
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
um our association isn't we're not
 
01:09:54.169 --> 01:09:54.179 align:start position:0%
looking for the applications that you
 
01:09:54.179 --> 01:09:54.890 align:start position:0%
looking for the applications that you
know

01:09:54.890 --> 01:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
um that the mechanical board I can only
 
01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
speak for the mechanical board is they
 
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
they review the application and
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
non-public and I would assume that
 
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's a non-public document so that
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
um available for for the public we're
 
01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
just looking for the documents of the
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
business that's going on with the
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
mechanical board that's going on that's
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
non-controversial I guess if you want to
 
01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
say at least get that have that have
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
that published
 
01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
um just to address a couple of things
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
just one thing on the time
 
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
as far as time goes the mechanical board
 
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
is not like your committee we don't get
 
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of visitors so when we have a
 
01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
visitor we kind of like to listen to
 
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
what they they they say at least that's
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
when I was there I don't know how it is
 
01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:43.850 align:start position:0%
when I was there I don't know how it is
now

01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
um so I I it would be nice to keep the
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
time let the chairman or the actually
 
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
the the board itself set board policy
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
set the board Rule and they in every
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
board because every board is different
 
01:10:59.870 --> 01:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
you could make a board rule
 
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
um to limit the public test the public
 
01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
comment not testimony public comment
 
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
that's one thing I would that I would
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
Rec that I would recommend because I
 
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
know with the mechanical board sometimes
 
01:11:14.689 --> 01:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
when you get into technical it is longer
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
than three three minutes
 
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
um so I think that my opinion that
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
should be left to the discretion of the
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
board because every board is is
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
different so knowing about the meetings
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
um uh 14 days would greatly help our uh
 
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.689 align:start position:0%
um uh 14 days would greatly help our uh
Association

01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
Association as well and we support this
 
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
bill for all the same reasons been
 
01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
testified before you it's very important
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
we find it very hard as own business
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
owners is working to try to have just
 
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
two days notice to get to a meeting you
 
01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
know I mean we're scheduled out months
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes and we do our best and it's
 
01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
very hot as a general public to get
 
01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
there and follow it online sometimes
 
01:12:23.689 --> 01:12:23.699 align:start position:0%
because they only have to post it two
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
days ahead even though they may list the
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
entire Year's worth of meetings it's not
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
official until they post it so this is
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
very important I think uh we had a
 
01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
concern with the fiscal impact but if
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to get corrected and
 
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
changed I think that we'll be all set
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
with that and we do have some warning
 
01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
that we can offer if they do a
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting to help that I
 
01:12:43.490 --> 01:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
think that could just be put on the
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
agenda that could be an agenda item that
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
states you know anything that made it
 
01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
come in in the last couple of days we
 
01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
have some warning we can suggest to fix
 
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
that having it in the law give them some
 
01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:54.970 align:start position:0%
that having it in the law give them some
flexibility

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:54.980 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
but we we would like to see this move
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
forward and we appreciate the committee
 
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
considering it and pretty much
 
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
everything else has been said so I won't
 
01:13:06.229 --> 01:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
tie up I'll keep my three minutes thank
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
you very much with questions any
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
questions yeah anybody
 
01:13:12.530 --> 01:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gerhard thank you
 
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
chairman just curious what is some of
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
the things that you've missed at these
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
meetings that were
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
important that you know what I'm saying
 
01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
like what are some of the things that
 
01:13:21.169 --> 01:13:21.179 align:start position:0%
were discussed that that oh I missed
 
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
that you know seriously just they can
 
01:13:25.370 --> 01:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative just knowing when the
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
meeting is like I've shown up here
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
multiple times and walked into the oplc
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
and they've told me that the
 
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:32.280 align:start position:0%
electrician's board meeting's been
 
01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
canceled and moved and I drove up here
 
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
from Pelham it cost me three hours by
 
01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:38.219 align:start position:0%
the time I come up and back and try to
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
go so it that's important and then
 
01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
um the information I've asked for many
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
things that's been discussed at the
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
public meeting if I can get a copy of it
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
because I assume it's public information
 
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
if they're talking about it
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
and one time the lawyer had to walk out
 
01:13:55.729 --> 01:13:55.739 align:start position:0%
of the room to go find out if it was
 
01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
public or not they just talked about it
 
01:13:59.450 --> 01:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
so I guess there's some confusion there
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they can fix that so that
 
01:14:02.689 --> 01:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
makes it hard when they're talking about
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
test results for our testing for our
 
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
electricians and stuff like that or
 
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
information that the board's looking at
 
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
you know we received a letter from the
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts concerning some
 
01:14:14.090 --> 01:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
reciprocity and we couldn't even look at
 
01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
it but they're talking about it so that
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
public information posted on time is
 
01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
helpful we can print it out bring it
 
01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
with us
 
01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
so it's very helpful all right thank you
 
01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:24.900 align:start position:0%
and if I may miss a chair I also agree
 
01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
that the time limit our chairman and our
 
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
board does a great job you know there
 
01:14:31.729 --> 01:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
may be some situations or concerns or
 
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
items that are on the agenda that are
 
01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
important and they require a little bit
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
of back and forth and information so I
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't suggest limiting that time
 
01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
limit unless it became an issue I think
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
the boards can handle it pretty well
 
01:14:44.810 --> 01:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
single one thank you so much thank you
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
um that's the last card I have did any
 
01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
other member of the public want to speak
 
01:14:53.930 --> 01:14:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
all right seeing no one uh
 
01:14:56.930 --> 01:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
representative like yes yes we are going
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
to refer this to the subcommittee on
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
licensing and uh we'll look forward to
 
01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
hearing from you guys uh with that I'll
 
01:15:05.570 --> 01:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on 377 uh 337
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
FM and uh we are in recess until 1pm

mm-hmm

03:00:54.230 --> 03:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:55.730 --> 03:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
it's one o'clock I would like to open
 
03:00:57.889 --> 03:00:57.899 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on House Bill 109
 
03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
relative to occupational therapy
 
03:01:01.730 --> 03:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
Practice Act and I would like to welcome
 
03:01:03.590 --> 03:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire to introduce the
 
03:01:03.600 --> 03:01:10.190 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire to introduce the
bill

03:01:10.190 --> 03:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:12.410 --> 03:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
03:01:14.630 --> 03:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Carol McGuire representing
 
03:01:18.050 --> 03:01:18.060 align:start position:0%
Merrimack 27 which is Allenstown
 
03:01:20.450 --> 03:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
Dunbarton Epsom and Hooksett
 
03:01:24.110 --> 03:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 109 was a request of the
 
03:01:27.230 --> 03:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
occupational therapists to update the
 
03:01:32.690 --> 03:01:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:38.210 --> 03:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
it is mostly clean up and updating I do
 
03:01:40.490 --> 03:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
have an amendment which you should have
 
03:01:44.690 --> 03:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
a copy of zero zero thirty H which adds
 
03:01:47.450 --> 03:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
a couple of words that fell out
 
03:01:51.410 --> 03:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
between line 20 and 21 between me and
 
03:01:54.830 --> 03:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
the and OLS they were intended from the
 
03:01:57.769 --> 03:01:57.779 align:start position:0%
beginning but as I said they fell out
 
03:02:01.010 --> 03:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
the only significant change to the
 
03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
current Practice Act
 
03:02:07.730 --> 03:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
is on page two line 36.
 
03:02:11.450 --> 03:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
where it says that occupational therapy
 
03:02:14.150 --> 03:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
can be provided without a referral
 
03:02:16.550 --> 03:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
subject to Regulatory and payer
 
03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:17.809 align:start position:0%
subject to Regulatory and payer
requirements

03:02:17.809 --> 03:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:02:20.210 --> 03:02:20.220 align:start position:0%
this is something that's very important
 
03:02:23.389 --> 03:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
in the schools because they frequently
 
03:02:23.399 --> 03:02:24.650 align:start position:0%
in the schools because they frequently
have

03:02:24.650 --> 03:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:02:26.210 --> 03:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
people that
 
03:02:29.030 --> 03:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
are evaluated by occupational therapists
 
03:02:31.670 --> 03:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
but don't have primary physicians or
 
03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
don't have insurance and the school is
 
03:02:37.670 --> 03:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
is would like to be to avoid some of the
 
03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:38.990 align:start position:0%
is would like to be to avoid some of the
paperwork

03:02:38.990 --> 03:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
03:02:41.570 --> 03:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
other types of therapists physical
 
03:02:44.990 --> 03:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
therapists and so forth don't require a
 
03:02:46.550 --> 03:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
referral as long as your insurance
 
03:02:50.510 --> 03:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
allows it and this is the same thing
 
03:02:53.450 --> 03:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
other than that I will answer some minor
 
03:02:56.389 --> 03:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
questions but I have people from the
 
03:02:58.010 --> 03:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
profession here to give you the real
 
03:02:58.020 --> 03:02:59.870 align:start position:0%
profession here to give you the real
stuff

03:02:59.870 --> 03:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
03:03:02.530 --> 03:03:02.540 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative Orion
 
03:03:06.290 --> 03:03:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative and uh thank
 
03:03:09.290 --> 03:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
you representative McGuire
 
03:03:12.290 --> 03:03:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh it does seem to clean it up but you
 
03:03:14.210 --> 03:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
did say on page two
 
03:03:17.510 --> 03:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
and uh I'm thinking about people like uh
 
03:03:19.730 --> 03:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
within the special education type of
 
03:03:23.030 --> 03:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
environment in in schools uh I think to
 
03:03:24.950 --> 03:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
Paris and some of the teachers file
 
03:03:28.250 --> 03:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
Medicare that doesn't affect that
 
03:03:30.889 --> 03:03:30.899 align:start position:0%
because that comes back in reimbursement
 
03:03:33.070 --> 03:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
to the municipality of the uh
 
03:03:35.990 --> 03:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that provides uh the
 
03:03:39.410 --> 03:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
education it simply as I understand it
 
03:03:41.469 --> 03:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
and they can give you more details
 
03:03:44.450 --> 03:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
eliminates the necessity of getting a
 
03:03:47.450 --> 03:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
physician or other medical practitioner
 
03:03:49.670 --> 03:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
to refer someone to the occupational
 
03:03:53.210 --> 03:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
therapist that the school has done the
 
03:03:55.490 --> 03:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
analysis and said they need occupational
 
03:03:55.500 --> 03:03:58.450 align:start position:0%
analysis and said they need occupational
therapy

03:03:58.450 --> 03:03:58.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:02.570 --> 03:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
it may cut the physician's income a
 
03:04:06.349 --> 03:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
little but you know noise level
 
03:04:10.670 --> 03:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:12.230 --> 03:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
no further questions thank you so much
 
03:04:15.410 --> 03:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:17.030 --> 03:04:17.040 align:start position:0%

Amero

03:04:24.950 --> 03:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:27.710 --> 03:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you so much for
 
03:04:30.469 --> 03:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak and thank you
 
03:04:32.990 --> 03:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
um representative McGuire for sponsoring
 
03:04:35.570 --> 03:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
this bill my name is Danielle Amero I'm
 
03:04:36.769 --> 03:04:36.779 align:start position:0%
the president of the New Hampshire
 
03:04:38.750 --> 03:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
Occupational Therapy Association and
 
03:04:40.190 --> 03:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
I've been working with a group of OTS
 
03:04:41.870 --> 03:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
that have been trying to put this
 
03:04:43.730 --> 03:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
language together for the past year and
 
03:04:46.250 --> 03:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
a half so I'm obviously testifying in
 
03:04:49.670 --> 03:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
support of in HB 109 representative
 
03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
McGuire really kind of took all my
 
03:04:53.870 --> 03:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
Salient points and already gave them to
 
03:04:55.550 --> 03:04:55.560 align:start position:0%
you but
 
03:04:58.550 --> 03:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
um occupational therapy is a diverse
 
03:05:00.530 --> 03:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
profession that stores people across the
 
03:05:02.450 --> 03:05:02.460 align:start position:0%
variety of healthcare education and
 
03:05:04.070 --> 03:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
community-based settings so we do
 
03:05:05.750 --> 03:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
believe that particularly that that
 
03:05:07.790 --> 03:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
referral requirement does restrict
 
03:05:07.800 --> 03:05:09.769 align:start position:0%
referral requirement does restrict
access

03:05:09.769 --> 03:05:09.779 align:start position:0%
access
 
03:05:11.630 --> 03:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
um just as a little definition often
 
03:05:13.730 --> 03:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
we're asked if we help people find jobs
 
03:05:16.969 --> 03:05:16.979 align:start position:0%
we do we do sometimes and it does
 
03:05:18.590 --> 03:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes involve looking for paid
 
03:05:20.630 --> 03:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
employment but it's much more than that
 
03:05:22.490 --> 03:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's referring to all the things a
 
03:05:24.290 --> 03:05:24.300 align:start position:0%
person needs in and wants to do in their
 
03:05:26.510 --> 03:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
daily life as an occupation
 
03:05:29.990 --> 03:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
so our job is to promote participation
 
03:05:32.050 --> 03:05:32.060 align:start position:0%
and that can really be in
 
03:05:33.830 --> 03:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
community-based settings working with
 
03:05:35.269 --> 03:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
people with mental health issues working
 
03:05:37.490 --> 03:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
with people that are not sheltered or
 
03:05:40.190 --> 03:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
homeless so we have a lot of value and
 
03:05:43.730 --> 03:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
benefit to the community and currently
 
03:05:46.969 --> 03:05:46.979 align:start position:0%
that is restricted by that referral
 
03:05:49.269 --> 03:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
requirement that is a highlight of it
 
03:05:52.610 --> 03:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
further our Practice Act has not been
 
03:05:55.670 --> 03:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
updated in 22 years and I've been a
 
03:05:59.030 --> 03:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
practicing OT for 30 years so um
 
03:06:01.969 --> 03:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
it's been a long time our occupational
 
03:06:05.630 --> 03:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
therapy our National Association has
 
03:06:07.969 --> 03:06:07.979 align:start position:0%
created a practice framework with
 
03:06:09.710 --> 03:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
updated language that they've actually
 
03:06:12.830 --> 03:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
updated four times sent in the last 20
 
03:06:15.710 --> 03:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
years so what we did was really pull
 
03:06:18.530 --> 03:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
from that national language and that
 
03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
framework to just update some of the
 
03:06:23.389 --> 03:06:23.399 align:start position:0%
definitions and Define our scope of
 
03:06:25.550 --> 03:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
practice to make it a little easier for
 
03:06:28.670 --> 03:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
the layperson to understand and really
 
03:06:32.150 --> 03:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
support OT as a unique profession in all
 
03:06:33.790 --> 03:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
those areas
 
03:06:37.309 --> 03:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
the schools is a big important issue
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
because it's an administrative burden to
 
03:06:43.730 --> 03:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
the schools to find the referrals for
 
03:06:45.650 --> 03:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
the students under the Medicaid to
 
03:06:47.269 --> 03:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
schools program this would be
 
03:06:50.030 --> 03:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
eliminating that burden and would leave
 
03:06:52.670 --> 03:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
us on a Level Playing Field with
 
03:06:56.330 --> 03:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
physical therapy and speech therapy we
 
03:06:58.550 --> 03:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
have worked with our oplc our New
 
03:07:01.690 --> 03:07:01.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gov governing board for OT
 
03:07:04.190 --> 03:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
throughout this process and they support
 
03:07:06.170 --> 03:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
us and we have support from the New
 
03:07:06.180 --> 03:07:07.269 align:start position:0%
us and we have support from the New
Hampshire

03:07:07.269 --> 03:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:07:11.690 --> 03:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
education special Educators Association
 
03:07:11.700 --> 03:07:12.590 align:start position:0%
education special Educators Association
um

03:07:12.590 --> 03:07:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:16.670 --> 03:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
we have also are working with the DHHS
 
03:07:19.370 --> 03:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
on community on community mental health
 
03:07:22.190 --> 03:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
clinics and the role OT might play
 
03:07:25.550 --> 03:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
in those clinics and we all know that's
 
03:07:28.250 --> 03:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
kind of a crisis right now I have
 
03:07:30.050 --> 03:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
reached out to the other Allied Health
 
03:07:32.450 --> 03:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
boards and their associations and let
 
03:07:34.550 --> 03:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
them know that this was in the works and
 
03:07:37.130 --> 03:07:37.140 align:start position:0%
offered them a copy of our Practice Act
 
03:07:39.530 --> 03:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
I have not heard any objections from
 
03:07:41.050 --> 03:07:41.060 align:start position:0%
those bodies
 
03:07:44.570 --> 03:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
and I am more than happy to answer any
 
03:07:47.570 --> 03:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
questions this does not change how we
 
03:07:49.849 --> 03:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
are regulated by insurance we will still
 
03:07:52.370 --> 03:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
have to get referrals for Medicare for
 
03:07:54.410 --> 03:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
other insurance companies so that is
 
03:07:56.570 --> 03:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
regulated at a federal level and doesn't
 
03:07:58.510 --> 03:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
need to be regulated at the state level
 
03:08:01.309 --> 03:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
the occupational therapists in the state
 
03:08:03.650 --> 03:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
in their facilities will still have a
 
03:08:07.250 --> 03:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
responsibility to their cons their
 
03:08:09.889 --> 03:08:09.899 align:start position:0%
clients to make sure that services are
 
03:08:12.889 --> 03:08:12.899 align:start position:0%
covered appropriately and referrals as
 
03:08:14.990 --> 03:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
needed are gotten
 
03:08:17.269 --> 03:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
um and that's I just want to thank you
 
03:08:19.670 --> 03:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
very much for your consideration if
 
03:08:21.889 --> 03:08:21.899 align:start position:0%
anybody has any questions thank you so
 
03:08:23.450 --> 03:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
much questions from the committee yes
 
03:08:26.210 --> 03:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt thank you Mr
 
03:08:29.330 --> 03:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
chairman uh just one simple question to
 
03:08:30.650 --> 03:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
03:08:32.750 --> 03:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
could you spell your last name I didn't
 
03:08:34.969 --> 03:08:34.979 align:start position:0%
quite catch it absolutely and I do have
 
03:08:37.730 --> 03:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
copies of of this the longer version of
 
03:08:42.469 --> 03:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:45.590 --> 03:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
very good uh thank you very much so uh
 
03:08:47.710 --> 03:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
and with regard to the amendment
 
03:08:49.670 --> 03:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has already said
 
03:08:52.130 --> 03:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
that the language was intended to be
 
03:08:54.590 --> 03:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
incorporated in the bill as filed but
 
03:08:57.950 --> 03:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
somehow that it dropped out so you're
 
03:09:00.650 --> 03:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
supportive of not only the bill as filed
 
03:09:02.990 --> 03:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
but also as it would be amended if the
 
03:09:05.750 --> 03:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee goes that way yes that it was
 
03:09:08.030 --> 03:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
in the original language and
 
03:09:11.090 --> 03:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
yeah very good thank you
 
03:09:13.010 --> 03:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:09:14.990 --> 03:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative true
 
03:09:16.550 --> 03:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:09:18.590 --> 03:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question I know what a
 
03:09:21.530 --> 03:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
physical therapist does they make me cry
 
03:09:23.690 --> 03:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
um what does an occupational therapist
 
03:09:26.990 --> 03:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
do so an occupational therapist does a
 
03:09:28.790 --> 03:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
lot of different things and hopefully
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
not make you cry something
 
03:09:31.439 --> 03:09:32.210 align:start position:0%
not make you cry something
um

03:09:32.210 --> 03:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:34.190 --> 03:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
it depends on the setting it really
 
03:09:36.290 --> 03:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
depends my background is in the hospital
 
03:09:39.110 --> 03:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
setting particularly in outpatient so my
 
03:09:41.330 --> 03:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
specialty is hand therapy so working
 
03:09:43.309 --> 03:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
with people with injuries to their upper
 
03:09:46.849 --> 03:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
extremities but we do a lot more we use
 
03:09:50.030 --> 03:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
occupation in that definition of your
 
03:09:54.110 --> 03:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
self-care your leisure your work we use
 
03:09:57.290 --> 03:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
those daily activities to help return
 
03:10:00.050 --> 03:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
you to doing those daily activities so
 
03:10:00.060 --> 03:10:01.010 align:start position:0%
you to doing those daily activities so
say

03:10:01.010 --> 03:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:10:02.870 --> 03:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
if you were in the hospital and you had
 
03:10:04.190 --> 03:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
a knee replacement and the physical
 
03:10:07.070 --> 03:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
therapist is making you cry because
 
03:10:09.830 --> 03:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
um they're bending your knee we would be
 
03:10:12.410 --> 03:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
making sure that you had
 
03:10:14.269 --> 03:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
um the tools and equipment so that you
 
03:10:15.710 --> 03:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
could go home independently and get
 
03:10:17.929 --> 03:10:17.939 align:start position:0%
yourself dressed and get your meals and
 
03:10:20.269 --> 03:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
get and do those daily activities that
 
03:10:25.309 --> 03:10:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:27.650 --> 03:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:10:29.690 --> 03:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
I have just one sure
 
03:10:31.670 --> 03:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
um so this is obviously a repeal and
 
03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
reenactment and you said that the
 
03:10:36.950 --> 03:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
language has been changed to Define Your
 
03:10:39.650 --> 03:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
Role better is it just a redefinition so
 
03:10:40.910 --> 03:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
that people can understand it better or
 
03:10:42.349 --> 03:10:42.359 align:start position:0%
is it an expansion because you said it's
 
03:10:44.570 --> 03:10:44.580 align:start position:0%
22 years essentially since it was last
 
03:10:47.330 --> 03:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
written has the definition or the
 
03:10:48.590 --> 03:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
umbrella under what your work Falls
 
03:10:51.710 --> 03:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
broadened I do not believe it's
 
03:10:54.650 --> 03:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
broadened if you look at side by side
 
03:10:57.230 --> 03:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
there may be more words involved trying
 
03:11:00.710 --> 03:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
to capture what we do
 
03:11:04.250 --> 03:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and and use the terminology but it's
 
03:11:06.710 --> 03:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
the same scope of practice okay great
 
03:11:07.790 --> 03:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so much appreciate your
 
03:11:07.800 --> 03:11:11.090 align:start position:0%
thank you so much appreciate your
testimony

03:11:11.090 --> 03:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:12.889 --> 03:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
that's the last card I had to any other
 
03:11:14.630 --> 03:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
member of the public want to speak yes
 
03:11:14.640 --> 03:11:20.349 align:start position:0%
member of the public want to speak yes
director

03:11:20.349 --> 03:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:23.210 --> 03:11:23.220 align:start position:0%
I had a quick question so
 
03:11:26.690 --> 03:11:26.700 align:start position:0%
um if you could just since this is being
 
03:11:28.849 --> 03:11:28.859 align:start position:0%
recorded you have to sit at the table so
 
03:11:32.090 --> 03:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
you're captured for posterity one way or
 
03:11:33.050 --> 03:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
the other
 
03:11:34.730 --> 03:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:11:40.190 --> 03:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
um so this is a redefinition uh but the
 
03:11:42.950 --> 03:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
the profession has it changed
 
03:11:45.490 --> 03:11:45.500 align:start position:0%
substantially in the 22 years
 
03:11:48.889 --> 03:11:48.899 align:start position:0%
that you've been involved in the 30
 
03:11:51.769 --> 03:11:51.779 align:start position:0%
years you said 30 years yeah hopefully I
 
03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
look younger than that but I don't know
 
03:11:58.429 --> 03:11:58.439 align:start position:0%
um so no the core of the profession has
 
03:12:00.590 --> 03:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
definitely stayed the same there's been
 
03:12:03.710 --> 03:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of advances in some of the science
 
03:12:06.530 --> 03:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
research and it's really a terminology
 
03:12:09.290 --> 03:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
update our terminology was
 
03:12:11.090 --> 03:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
um very different when I went to school
 
03:12:15.050 --> 03:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
in terms of describing how we do what we
 
03:12:18.349 --> 03:12:18.359 align:start position:0%
do but we still do the same things that
 
03:12:21.290 --> 03:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
we did if that makes sense all right
 
03:12:21.300 --> 03:12:22.670 align:start position:0%
we did if that makes sense all right
follow-up

03:12:22.670 --> 03:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:12:25.849 --> 03:12:25.859 align:start position:0%
so and and I believe you said in your
 
03:12:28.910 --> 03:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony that you are are you
 
03:12:31.130 --> 03:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
the chair of the board hey I'm the
 
03:12:33.410 --> 03:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
president of nhota the president
 
03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
Association and you the association also
 
03:12:40.010 --> 03:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
endorses the bill absolutely yes very
 
03:12:43.790 --> 03:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:45.830 --> 03:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:54.710 --> 03:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:12:55.910 --> 03:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Lindsey
 
03:12:57.950 --> 03:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
Courtney executive director office of
 
03:13:00.349 --> 03:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
professional Ace insurance certification
 
03:13:03.469 --> 03:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
oplc doesn't take a position on the
 
03:13:05.210 --> 03:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
substance of the bill
 
03:13:08.330 --> 03:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
um but in reviewing the matter with some
 
03:13:10.610 --> 03:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
of our advisory boards that are directly
 
03:13:13.969 --> 03:13:13.979 align:start position:0%
related by the office they there was a
 
03:13:16.610 --> 03:13:16.620 align:start position:0%
concern about potentially the language
 
03:13:18.830 --> 03:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
being viewed as an expansion of the
 
03:13:20.630 --> 03:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
scope and
 
03:13:23.330 --> 03:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
um it kind of impinging on other
 
03:13:25.250 --> 03:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
practice acts
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
um there is no exemption language in The
 
03:13:32.210 --> 03:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
Practice Act currently so we would
 
03:13:34.670 --> 03:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
suggest a potential modification just to
 
03:13:37.670 --> 03:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
make it clear that for example
 
03:13:41.330 --> 03:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
recreational therapists are not required
 
03:13:43.250 --> 03:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
to be licensed under the occupational
 
03:13:45.769 --> 03:13:45.779 align:start position:0%
therapy Practice Act to the extent that
 
03:13:47.769 --> 03:13:47.779 align:start position:0%
their scope
 
03:13:50.929 --> 03:13:50.939 align:start position:0%
overlaps other than that we don't have
 
03:13:53.210 --> 03:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
any concerns with the bill regarding
 
03:13:55.550 --> 03:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
that exemption language we see that in
 
03:13:58.610 --> 03:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
other bills like the Medical Practice
 
03:14:02.269 --> 03:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
Act if for example and we would just
 
03:14:04.130 --> 03:14:04.140 align:start position:0%
suggest that that language be added to
 
03:14:05.450 --> 03:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
make it clear
 
03:14:08.030 --> 03:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions
 
03:14:10.730 --> 03:14:10.740 align:start position:0%
yes representative likes yeah just uh
 
03:14:12.590 --> 03:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
could you send us your suggested
 
03:14:16.190 --> 03:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:18.110 --> 03:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
03:14:20.210 --> 03:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your time thank you
 
03:14:22.309 --> 03:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
03:14:24.050 --> 03:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else in the public that
 
03:14:28.429 --> 03:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:29.990 --> 03:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
right well then I will close the public
 
03:14:32.870 --> 03:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
hearing on 109 and we will come back at
 
03:14:41.150 --> 03:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:42.769 --> 03:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
representative likes this is coming to
 
03:14:43.960 --> 03:14:43.970 align:start position:0%
your subcommittee
 
03:14:43.970 --> 03:31:18.349 align:start position:0%
your subcommittee
[Laughter]

03:31:18.349 --> 03:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:20.809 --> 03:31:20.819 align:start position:0%
good afternoon welcome back I'm opening
 
03:31:23.210 --> 03:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
the hearing for House Bill 258 and I
 
03:31:32.330 --> 03:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:34.429 --> 03:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping I remember my own name here
 
03:31:36.110 --> 03:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
I'm a little nervous
 
03:31:39.110 --> 03:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
um I'm Diane Kelly I represent Hillsboro
 
03:31:42.349 --> 03:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
District 32 which encompasses my town of
 
03:31:45.410 --> 03:31:45.420 align:start position:0%
Temple and also Wilton and New Ipswich
 
03:31:49.790 --> 03:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
and um I am going to be introducing a
 
03:31:53.290 --> 03:31:53.300 align:start position:0%
radically amended version of HB 258
 
03:31:56.450 --> 03:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
because the original version came back
 
03:31:59.630 --> 03:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
from OLS pretty much 180 degrees
 
03:32:03.530 --> 03:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
opposite of what I was hoping for so um
 
03:32:05.330 --> 03:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
I believe everybody should have copies
 
03:32:08.090 --> 03:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
of the new Amendment and this is
 
03:32:08.100 --> 03:32:09.190 align:start position:0%
of the new Amendment and this is
amendment

03:32:09.190 --> 03:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:32:12.650 --> 03:32:12.660 align:start position:0%
0051h correct
 
03:32:14.030 --> 03:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm
 
03:32:16.550 --> 03:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
I hope so
 
03:32:19.130 --> 03:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
on the left under your name yes yes
 
03:32:21.950 --> 03:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:32:21.960 --> 03:32:22.729 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:32:22.729 --> 03:32:22.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:22.739 --> 03:32:24.110 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:32:24.110 --> 03:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:27.410 --> 03:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
um basically what I am hoping to
 
03:32:32.990 --> 03:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish is to get animal Chiropractic
 
03:32:35.929 --> 03:32:35.939 align:start position:0%
um out of the
 
03:32:38.990 --> 03:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
um purview of the veterinary board New
 
03:32:42.769 --> 03:32:42.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire veterinary board and um
 
03:32:45.410 --> 03:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
I hope that this bill will accomplish
 
03:32:47.690 --> 03:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
that in the United States
 
03:32:49.849 --> 03:32:49.859 align:start position:0%
human chiropractors are considered
 
03:32:52.309 --> 03:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
primary care doctors so if that means
 
03:32:54.110 --> 03:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
you don't need a referral to see them
 
03:32:58.010 --> 03:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
but for Animals the laws are kind of
 
03:33:00.530 --> 03:33:00.540 align:start position:0%
vague and chiropractors who are highly
 
03:33:03.170 --> 03:33:03.180 align:start position:0%
trained and certified to work on animals
 
03:33:05.630 --> 03:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
are at risk of losing their licenses if
 
03:33:07.790 --> 03:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
they adjust an animal without direct
 
03:33:10.250 --> 03:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
supervision of a vet and direct
 
03:33:13.910 --> 03:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
supervision is a a problem that is
 
03:33:17.690 --> 03:33:17.700 align:start position:0%
has come up in many states and will be
 
03:33:19.969 --> 03:33:19.979 align:start position:0%
coming up in a lot of States because a
 
03:33:22.010 --> 03:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
lot of animal chiropractors work on
 
03:33:24.590 --> 03:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
horses or large animals and they're
 
03:33:26.210 --> 03:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
traveling all the time you can't have a
 
03:33:29.330 --> 03:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
vet follow you all over the state and
 
03:33:31.729 --> 03:33:31.739 align:start position:0%
um the biggest problem that I see is
 
03:33:31.739 --> 03:33:32.690 align:start position:0%
um the biggest problem that I see is
that

03:33:32.690 --> 03:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:33:35.450 --> 03:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
a lot of people who want their animals
 
03:33:38.210 --> 03:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
treated either try to get a vet
 
03:33:39.769 --> 03:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
appointment and it takes weeks to get
 
03:33:43.790 --> 03:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
into a vet or and or the other thing is
 
03:33:47.150 --> 03:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
the onerous expense going to see a vet
 
03:33:47.160 --> 03:33:48.250 align:start position:0%
the onerous expense going to see a vet
first

03:33:48.250 --> 03:33:48.260 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
can be very expensive and vets tend to
 
03:33:54.469 --> 03:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
be reticent to refer to chiropractors
 
03:33:55.790 --> 03:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
which has been the case with human
 
03:33:58.370 --> 03:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
doctors throughout time for a long time
 
03:34:00.530 --> 03:34:00.540 align:start position:0%
human doctors were very opposed to
 
03:34:03.290 --> 03:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic and that's changing but um
 
03:34:06.050 --> 03:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
anyway it seems
 
03:34:06.060 --> 03:34:06.830 align:start position:0%
anyway it seems
um

03:34:06.830 --> 03:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:09.650 --> 03:34:09.660 align:start position:0%
rather sad that people would like to
 
03:34:11.809 --> 03:34:11.819 align:start position:0%
take their dogs to get chiropractic care
 
03:34:14.389 --> 03:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
and perhaps would not because they
 
03:34:16.969 --> 03:34:16.979 align:start position:0%
couldn't get in for a long time or they
 
03:34:19.010 --> 03:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford it or whatever and I
 
03:34:21.290 --> 03:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
have known many people who
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
um just wouldn't do it they wouldn't
 
03:34:25.729 --> 03:34:25.739 align:start position:0%
choose to spend the money or take the
 
03:34:25.739 --> 03:34:26.530 align:start position:0%
choose to spend the money or take the
time

03:34:26.530 --> 03:34:26.540 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:34:29.929 --> 03:34:29.939 align:start position:0%
whereas an animal Chiropractic visit can
 
03:34:32.990 --> 03:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
be pretty immediate relief pretty
 
03:34:35.389 --> 03:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
quickly and for considerably less
 
03:34:40.370 --> 03:34:40.380 align:start position:0%
expense so that is my goal with this
 
03:34:40.380 --> 03:34:42.290 align:start position:0%
expense so that is my goal with this
bill

03:34:42.290 --> 03:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
um and I think part of the problem with
 
03:34:47.510 --> 03:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
the vet board is that there's a gross
 
03:34:49.910 --> 03:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of animal Chiropractic
 
03:34:52.250 --> 03:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
and the idea is that you're not at War
 
03:34:54.410 --> 03:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
animal chiropractors are not at war with
 
03:34:56.510 --> 03:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarians it's it's something that
 
03:34:59.769 --> 03:34:59.779 align:start position:0%
they could work very well on together
 
03:35:02.870 --> 03:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
and um you know communication is
 
03:35:05.510 --> 03:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
important but it's not like
 
03:35:07.729 --> 03:35:07.739 align:start position:0%
chiropractors can't offer really
 
03:35:11.210 --> 03:35:11.220 align:start position:0%
important needed care so
 
03:35:13.969 --> 03:35:13.979 align:start position:0%
um I think that the best solution at
 
03:35:15.710 --> 03:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
this point is to provide boundaries
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
between Veterinary and Chiropractic so
 
03:35:21.170 --> 03:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
that people can get the care they need
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
for their animals and the last thing I
 
03:35:25.550 --> 03:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
want to say about this is that it seems
 
03:35:28.490 --> 03:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
rather odd in a society that doesn't
 
03:35:31.490 --> 03:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
value animals as much as humans that you
 
03:35:33.170 --> 03:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
can take your child to a chiropractor
 
03:35:36.349 --> 03:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
with no medical referral but you need a
 
03:35:38.990 --> 03:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
medical referral for your dog it just
 
03:35:42.290 --> 03:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
seems unnecessary and
 
03:35:51.710 --> 03:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:54.229 --> 03:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt no
 
03:35:54.239 --> 03:35:55.030 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt no
no

03:35:55.030 --> 03:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:35:59.269 --> 03:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:02.710 --> 03:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
anyone else anyone have a question
 
03:36:05.269 --> 03:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask what's the problem
 
03:36:07.309 --> 03:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
you're trying to solve
 
03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
um at the moment in New Hampshire the
 
03:36:13.130 --> 03:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
veterinary board wants oversight of
 
03:36:16.490 --> 03:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
animal Chiropractic and several
 
03:36:18.830 --> 03:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
chiropractors animal chiropractors also
 
03:36:20.570 --> 03:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
human but animal chiropractors have
 
03:36:23.210 --> 03:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
received cease and desist letters and
 
03:36:24.889 --> 03:36:24.899 align:start position:0%
they feel like they're kind of operating
 
03:36:27.710 --> 03:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
underground which is unfortunate Montana
 
03:36:30.469 --> 03:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
has a bill California is working on a
 
03:36:32.450 --> 03:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
bill Colorado has a bill in Montana has
 
03:36:34.610 --> 03:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
a bill I really really like and would
 
03:36:38.150 --> 03:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
like to see happen in New Hampshire I
 
03:36:40.190 --> 03:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
would love to see a bill in New
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:48.349 --> 03:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
thank you but in in light of our
 
03:36:51.610 --> 03:36:51.620 align:start position:0%
scheduling issues would your Amendment
 
03:36:54.710 --> 03:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
solve the problem in the short term
 
03:36:58.849 --> 03:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
I believe it would okay thank you
 
03:37:00.650 --> 03:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you for
 
03:37:03.769 --> 03:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:06.050 --> 03:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:20.870 --> 03:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
sorry hello I'm Melissa orgilla I woke
 
03:37:22.849 --> 03:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
up one morning and our dog Molly was
 
03:37:24.590 --> 03:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
crying in pain limping and she had a
 
03:37:29.090 --> 03:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:32.210 --> 03:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
I heard through Diane Word of Mouth that
 
03:37:34.190 --> 03:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
there's Chiropractic for dogs and I
 
03:37:35.809 --> 03:37:35.819 align:start position:0%
booked an appointment
 
03:37:37.969 --> 03:37:37.979 align:start position:0%
after two adjustments she was completely
 
03:37:40.250 --> 03:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
good and I was really happy with the
 
03:37:40.260 --> 03:37:44.809 align:start position:0%
good and I was really happy with the
treatment

03:37:44.809 --> 03:37:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:47.389 --> 03:37:47.399 align:start position:0%
I'm also a copywriter and I know that
 
03:37:49.490 --> 03:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
it's a trending market right now with
 
03:37:51.410 --> 03:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
holistic dog ideas
 
03:37:58.490 --> 03:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:00.290 --> 03:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
I think it's like mainstream doctors
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
maybe government it could be but I just
 
03:38:04.010 --> 03:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
think that we deserve our god-given
 
03:38:05.690 --> 03:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
rights for respect Civility and freedom
 
03:38:09.290 --> 03:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
to choose our courses in our dog care
 
03:38:09.300 --> 03:38:10.750 align:start position:0%
to choose our courses in our dog care
foreign

03:38:10.750 --> 03:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:38:13.130 --> 03:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
s why I think that
 
03:38:15.170 --> 03:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
that I would be unwilling and unable
 
03:38:17.150 --> 03:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
possibly to bring Molly to the
 
03:38:20.150 --> 03:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
chiropractor could be because of money
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
because our last dog that we had we had
 
03:38:23.269 --> 03:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
to put her down
 
03:38:27.110 --> 03:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:30.349 --> 03:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
and it's time sensitive if I had to go
 
03:38:32.330 --> 03:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
through a veterinarian and I did have
 
03:38:34.309 --> 03:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
the money
 
03:38:35.929 --> 03:38:35.939 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:38:38.690 --> 03:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
I wanted as close as I could get to get
 
03:38:40.969 --> 03:38:40.979 align:start position:0%
her care now I didn't want to wait she
 
03:38:42.950 --> 03:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
was really in pain
 
03:38:46.010 --> 03:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
and then when I was in the chiropractor
 
03:38:48.889 --> 03:38:48.899 align:start position:0%
or the veterinarian's office last time
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
I like holistic medicine and holistic
 
03:38:53.750 --> 03:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
foods and I asked a lot of questions
 
03:38:56.809 --> 03:38:56.819 align:start position:0%
that had to do with what was in the food
 
03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
and you know this is not related to it
 
03:39:00.170 --> 03:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
but I don't think they had an
 
03:39:01.490 --> 03:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
understanding at all but I was trying to
 
03:39:03.889 --> 03:39:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:05.450 --> 03:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
so that's another reason I just don't
 
03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
think I think there's a disconnect
 
03:39:08.990 --> 03:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
between the veterans and the
 
03:39:10.370 --> 03:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
chiropractors I didn't even know myself
 
03:39:11.450 --> 03:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
that there was such a thing as
 
03:39:11.460 --> 03:39:12.710 align:start position:0%
that there was such a thing as
chiropractor

03:39:12.710 --> 03:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
chiropractor
 
03:39:15.229 --> 03:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
for dogs until I met Diane and the story
 
03:39:17.210 --> 03:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
and my husband's like hey Diane brings
 
03:39:18.889 --> 03:39:18.899 align:start position:0%
her dog to bed is that crazy I mean to
 
03:39:20.750 --> 03:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
the chiropractor I'm like
 
03:39:23.870 --> 03:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
hey that sounds good I'll try it
 
03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
that's what happened it's my story
 
03:39:28.370 --> 03:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
03:39:30.469 --> 03:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
are there any committee questions from
 
03:39:32.929 --> 03:39:32.939 align:start position:0%

it's very impactful and I to share in
 
03:40:16.550 --> 03:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
your view I've been there before so um I
 
03:40:19.250 --> 03:40:19.260 align:start position:0%
think that chiropractors for Animals
 
03:40:21.469 --> 03:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
just like people are a great idea and
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the time to come
 
03:40:25.490 --> 03:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
and and testify I know it feels very
 
03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and a little bit scary but
 
03:40:31.550 --> 03:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
you did a good job thank you thank you
 
03:40:34.010 --> 03:40:34.020 align:start position:0%

okay you're good thank you
 
03:40:37.190 --> 03:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative Earhart
 
03:40:38.990 --> 03:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair you might not know
 
03:40:40.729 --> 03:40:40.739 align:start position:0%
this but I'm just curious had there been
 
03:40:45.530 --> 03:40:45.540 align:start position:0%
any prosecutions of chiropractors for
 
03:40:47.510 --> 03:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
fixing dogs or what do you call
 
03:40:49.790 --> 03:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
adjusting dogs I think it's pretty new
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's a new practice I think so I haven't
 
03:40:53.150 --> 03:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
heard of it I never heard of it myself
 
03:40:54.110 --> 03:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious like are there
 
03:40:55.490 --> 03:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
chiropractors in jail right now for
 
03:40:57.170 --> 03:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
doing this underground I mean I don't
 
03:40:58.729 --> 03:40:58.739 align:start position:0%
think so okay I'm just curious all right
 
03:41:01.610 --> 03:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:03.530 --> 03:41:03.540 align:start position:0%

03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
the original bill that was submitted and
 
03:42:13.070 --> 03:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
I would like to thank representative
 
03:42:15.889 --> 03:42:15.899 align:start position:0%
Kelly for making the adjustments to
 
03:42:20.030 --> 03:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
remove Romans 2 and 3 which deal with
 
03:42:23.330 --> 03:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
the referrals required of chiropractors
 
03:42:25.370 --> 03:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
from veterinarians
 
03:42:28.370 --> 03:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
um our membership did not feel that that
 
03:42:30.110 --> 03:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
was something that was necessary to be
 
03:42:32.450 --> 03:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
put into law as you heard from the
 
03:42:34.729 --> 03:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
others it would create some unintended
 
03:42:37.790 --> 03:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
consequences increase costs for the pet
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
owners and drag out the time that they
 
03:42:43.250 --> 03:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
would be able to get their dogs or other
 
03:42:46.610 --> 03:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
pets into the chiropractor I personally
 
03:42:49.250 --> 03:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
as a chiropractor for my dogs as well we
 
03:42:52.250 --> 03:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
compete in confirmation which is if
 
03:42:55.070 --> 03:42:55.080 align:start position:0%
you've seen Westminster on TV it's kind
 
03:42:58.250 --> 03:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
of that form of competition but in order
 
03:43:01.370 --> 03:43:01.380 align:start position:0%
to keep the dogs in good form and have
 
03:43:02.990 --> 03:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
the best Movement we utilize
 
03:43:06.229 --> 03:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
chiropractors prior to competitions
 
03:43:08.450 --> 03:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
um and sometimes you need to get those
 
03:43:12.110 --> 03:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
adjustments in last minute quickly you
 
03:43:13.849 --> 03:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
don't realize that there's an issue that
 
03:43:16.130 --> 03:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed and have all of
 
03:43:19.490 --> 03:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
this time to have that take place as
 
03:43:22.729 --> 03:43:22.739 align:start position:0%
mentioned the vet industry is quite
 
03:43:26.290 --> 03:43:26.300 align:start position:0%
burdened with the lack of veterinarians
 
03:43:28.969 --> 03:43:28.979 align:start position:0%
they definitely have had a reduction in
 
03:43:31.010 --> 03:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
the veterinarians making getting
 
03:43:34.610 --> 03:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
appointments harder for the pet owners
 
03:43:38.330 --> 03:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
and then in by adding the need for
 
03:43:40.610 --> 03:43:40.620 align:start position:0%
everyone to use a chiropractor to need a
 
03:43:42.769 --> 03:43:42.779 align:start position:0%
vet appointment to get that referral you
 
03:43:44.330 --> 03:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
would actually be creating additional
 
03:43:47.750 --> 03:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
burden on the vet industry not only that
 
03:43:49.790 --> 03:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
taking away appointment slots from
 
03:43:52.510 --> 03:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
animals who may need other treatment
 
03:43:55.250 --> 03:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
that could actually be more time
 
03:43:58.490 --> 03:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
sensitive for them than being slotted
 
03:44:00.050 --> 03:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
after someone just trying to get a
 
03:44:03.349 --> 03:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:05.389 --> 03:44:05.399 align:start position:0%
um chair room and you asked a great
 
03:44:07.429 --> 03:44:07.439 align:start position:0%
question it's one of the ones I have in
 
03:44:09.290 --> 03:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
my testimony which I'll give copies of
 
03:44:11.870 --> 03:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
and I did email as well but what is the
 
03:44:14.870 --> 03:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
problem that we're trying to solve our
 
03:44:16.910 --> 03:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
community isn't aware of any issues that
 
03:44:18.650 --> 03:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
there have been with chiropractors in
 
03:44:22.190 --> 03:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire nor anyone receiving cease
 
03:44:24.590 --> 03:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
and desist letters recently as was
 
03:44:26.990 --> 03:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned I would hope that we would be
 
03:44:28.610 --> 03:44:28.620 align:start position:0%
able to hear from the New Hampshire
 
03:44:31.969 --> 03:44:31.979 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Medical Association to speak
 
03:44:34.610 --> 03:44:34.620 align:start position:0%
to that they would likely be aware if
 
03:44:37.250 --> 03:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
there was anything going on that needs
 
03:44:41.630 --> 03:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:41.640 --> 03:44:42.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:44:42.349 --> 03:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:47.210 --> 03:44:47.220 align:start position:0%
going to the amended version that was
 
03:44:50.570 --> 03:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
presented by representative Kelly and
 
03:44:52.550 --> 03:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
Pauline Chiropractic from veterinary
 
03:44:55.969 --> 03:44:55.979 align:start position:0%
medicine I don't know that we can have a
 
03:44:58.130 --> 03:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
full position on that and that should
 
03:45:02.110 --> 03:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
also lean on the nhvma for their
 
03:45:05.510 --> 03:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts on if that's appropriate I do
 
03:45:08.269 --> 03:45:08.279 align:start position:0%
know that chiropractors in general do go
 
03:45:10.729 --> 03:45:10.739 align:start position:0%
through certification processes
 
03:45:13.550 --> 03:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
to receive their licenses to be
 
03:45:17.330 --> 03:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
chiropractors there's a couple different
 
03:45:19.969 --> 03:45:19.979 align:start position:0%
businesses that do that at the national
 
03:45:22.610 --> 03:45:22.620 align:start position:0%
level or within New Hampshire we do have
 
03:45:24.710 --> 03:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure and
 
03:45:27.410 --> 03:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
certification oplc and I think they
 
03:45:29.630 --> 03:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
spoke at the prior hearing so hopefully
 
03:45:31.010 --> 03:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
they're going to speak to this one as
 
03:45:32.990 --> 03:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
well they do have a board of
 
03:45:35.630 --> 03:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic examiners I don't know if
 
03:45:38.990 --> 03:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
that Ventures into animal chiropractors
 
03:45:41.650 --> 03:45:41.660 align:start position:0%
as well or if it's strictly human
 
03:45:44.990 --> 03:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
the chiro Chiropractic profession is
 
03:45:46.969 --> 03:45:46.979 align:start position:0%
regulated already in New Hampshire law
 
03:45:48.729 --> 03:45:48.739 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
03:45:52.910 --> 03:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
316-a and the board administer the
 
03:45:55.490 --> 03:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
board's administrative rules so you
 
03:45:58.490 --> 03:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
could look to that let RSA to see if
 
03:46:00.530 --> 03:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
that is encompassing and whether we
 
03:46:02.690 --> 03:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
would actually need to create any
 
03:46:04.490 --> 03:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
further certifications for animal
 
03:46:04.500 --> 03:46:06.710 align:start position:0%
further certifications for animal
Chiropractic

03:46:06.710 --> 03:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic
 
03:46:08.450 --> 03:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:46:11.330 --> 03:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
I think lastly I would just want to
 
03:46:13.610 --> 03:46:13.620 align:start position:0%
request I personally and my membership
 
03:46:16.610 --> 03:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
feel that the best option for this bill
 
03:46:19.610 --> 03:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
is to vote in expedient to legislate
 
03:46:21.530 --> 03:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
unless we find that there really is a
 
03:46:24.349 --> 03:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
problem that is being solved and I would
 
03:46:26.510 --> 03:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you very much
 
03:46:28.250 --> 03:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
03:46:28.260 --> 03:46:29.269 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

03:46:29.269 --> 03:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:46:31.910 --> 03:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
03:46:34.450 --> 03:46:34.460 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
03:46:38.170 --> 03:46:38.180 align:start position:0%
so since the sponsor has basically
 
03:46:40.969 --> 03:46:40.979 align:start position:0%
disavowed the language of the original
 
03:46:40.979 --> 03:46:42.910 align:start position:0%
disavowed the language of the original
Bill

03:46:42.910 --> 03:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:46:45.370 --> 03:46:45.380 align:start position:0%
my guess is that the committee would
 
03:46:48.889 --> 03:46:48.899 align:start position:0%
want to look at the amendment that the
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
sponsor really wants as opposed to the
 
03:46:53.469 --> 03:46:53.479 align:start position:0%
language that she doesn't want
 
03:46:58.630 --> 03:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
but so it does speak to
 
03:46:58.640 --> 03:47:01.389 align:start position:0%
but so it does speak to
exempting

03:47:01.389 --> 03:47:01.399 align:start position:0%
exempting
 
03:47:03.670 --> 03:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic from
 
03:47:03.680 --> 03:47:05.389 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic from
the

03:47:05.389 --> 03:47:05.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:47:07.969 --> 03:47:07.979 align:start position:0%
oversight of the veteran veterinarian
 
03:47:11.090 --> 03:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
profession uh you mentioned the the that
 
03:47:13.570 --> 03:47:13.580 align:start position:0%
the uh that there are New Hampshire
 
03:47:16.690 --> 03:47:16.700 align:start position:0%
entities that do train
 
03:47:20.389 --> 03:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic uh
 
03:47:23.630 --> 03:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
animal chiropractors okay
 
03:47:25.790 --> 03:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
um so they don't technically train it
 
03:47:28.429 --> 03:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
but they would certify and keep licenses
 
03:47:30.710 --> 03:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
up to date
 
03:47:33.710 --> 03:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
as far as training that would be done at
 
03:47:37.490 --> 03:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
a college or some schooling or another
 
03:47:40.309 --> 03:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
organization I can't speak specifically
 
03:47:43.010 --> 03:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire organizations who are
 
03:47:45.349 --> 03:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
teaching Chiropractic maybe one of our
 
03:47:48.349 --> 03:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
universities but my understanding is the
 
03:47:51.469 --> 03:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
old oplc for example is managing
 
03:47:51.479 --> 03:47:53.269 align:start position:0%
old oplc for example is managing
certifications

03:47:53.269 --> 03:47:53.279 align:start position:0%
certifications
 
03:47:54.830 --> 03:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:47:54.840 --> 03:47:56.090 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
okay

03:47:56.090 --> 03:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:47:59.990 --> 03:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:01.849 --> 03:48:01.859 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:08.510 --> 03:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who would wish to
 
03:48:12.530 --> 03:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 258 so chair
 
03:48:14.450 --> 03:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
um if you're okay with it I'd like to
 
03:48:16.429 --> 03:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
ask a question of Representative Kelly
 
03:48:18.309 --> 03:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
if she's willing to answer it
 
03:48:27.290 --> 03:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:29.150 --> 03:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um
 
03:48:31.190 --> 03:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned that there's uh you
 
03:48:31.200 --> 03:48:31.910 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned that there's uh you
know

03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:48:33.950 --> 03:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
some legislation Montana that you
 
03:48:35.450 --> 03:48:35.460 align:start position:0%
thought would be good and then you've
 
03:48:38.090 --> 03:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
got this amendment my question is
 
03:48:41.269 --> 03:48:41.279 align:start position:0%
in general what what would that
 
03:48:43.370 --> 03:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
legislation may be for the future do
 
03:48:46.490 --> 03:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
that your Amendment doesn't do and I
 
03:48:48.950 --> 03:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
guess the underlying question is
 
03:48:51.170 --> 03:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
is there a good reason for us to adopt
 
03:48:53.150 --> 03:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
this amendment and pass the bill or to
 
03:48:53.160 --> 03:48:54.050 align:start position:0%
this amendment and pass the bill or to
just

03:48:54.050 --> 03:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:48:56.809 --> 03:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
uh for this year uh i t you know
 
03:48:59.150 --> 03:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
recommend itl on the bill as a whole
 
03:49:01.070 --> 03:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
you know what is the reason
 
03:49:03.050 --> 03:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
the advantage of adopting this amendment
 
03:49:04.670 --> 03:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
and then recommending the bill be passed
 
03:49:07.070 --> 03:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
versus just italing the whole thing for
 
03:49:09.229 --> 03:49:09.239 align:start position:0%
now if there's maybe some future thing
 
03:49:11.929 --> 03:49:11.939 align:start position:0%
that might you think might be better
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
for me ideally the reason why we would
 
03:49:19.370 --> 03:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
pass this as amended is because I think
 
03:49:20.809 --> 03:49:20.819 align:start position:0%
there are people out there right now in
 
03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I know there are people
 
03:49:23.330 --> 03:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
out there right now in New Hampshire who
 
03:49:24.889 --> 03:49:24.899 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to utilize
 
03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
chiropractors without their
 
03:49:28.429 --> 03:49:28.439 align:start position:0%
chiropractors being nervous that their
 
03:49:32.150 --> 03:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
licenses are at stake the one I use and
 
03:49:33.650 --> 03:49:33.660 align:start position:0%
am very aware of would like to expand
 
03:49:37.969 --> 03:49:37.979 align:start position:0%
her practice to a bigger place where a
 
03:49:39.889 --> 03:49:39.899 align:start position:0%
lot of animal chiropractors use pools
 
03:49:42.110 --> 03:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
like put horses in pools and underwater
 
03:49:44.450 --> 03:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
treadmills and stuff like that and if
 
03:49:46.610 --> 03:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
they're the one I know is afraid to
 
03:49:49.070 --> 03:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
expand because she has been threatened
 
03:49:53.210 --> 03:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
with cease and desist letters and um and
 
03:49:55.849 --> 03:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
so I because my dog utilizes
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic all the time we were in a
 
03:49:59.330 --> 03:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
car accident someone plowed into my car
 
03:50:01.429 --> 03:50:01.439 align:start position:0%
and he's been injured so we utilize
 
03:50:03.050 --> 03:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic all the time and I really
 
03:50:05.510 --> 03:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
love his chiropractor and I don't want
 
03:50:09.950 --> 03:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
that chiropractor to be afraid that
 
03:50:12.290 --> 03:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
she's putting herself at risk
 
03:50:14.870 --> 03:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:50:17.450 --> 03:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt thank you madam
 
03:50:19.570 --> 03:50:19.580 align:start position:0%
chair so uh
 
03:50:23.389 --> 03:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
there's been no testimony whatsoever uh
 
03:50:28.130 --> 03:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
with regard to what uh I heard from uh
 
03:50:29.809 --> 03:50:29.819 align:start position:0%
uh from a
 
03:50:32.750 --> 03:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizen Diane Richardson
 
03:50:36.769 --> 03:50:36.779 align:start position:0%
she's got a piece of one copy so we
 
03:50:38.389 --> 03:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
should get some copies of the rest of
 
03:50:40.910 --> 03:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
the committee can see this but I will
 
03:50:43.150 --> 03:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
you know try to
 
03:50:46.910 --> 03:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
synopsize what she had to say that that
 
03:50:46.920 --> 03:50:49.269 align:start position:0%
synopsize what she had to say that that
uh

03:50:49.269 --> 03:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:50:52.130 --> 03:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
these animal chiropractors are doing
 
03:50:54.769 --> 03:50:54.779 align:start position:0%
this uh yeah pass that down in the chair
 
03:50:59.090 --> 03:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
with you uh are doing this but and and
 
03:51:03.229 --> 03:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
they're clearly fulfilling a need
 
03:51:03.239 --> 03:51:05.090 align:start position:0%
they're clearly fulfilling a need
and

03:51:05.090 --> 03:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:07.849 --> 03:51:07.859 align:start position:0%
um and veterinarians are not available
 
03:51:11.990 --> 03:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
you testify to that uh and so it's kind
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
of like going from here to uh Nashua by
 
03:51:19.910 --> 03:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
way of um let's say Los Angeles
 
03:51:21.469 --> 03:51:21.479 align:start position:0%
um especially in terms of the time
 
03:51:23.929 --> 03:51:23.939 align:start position:0%
involved waiting to get a veterinarian
 
03:51:26.349 --> 03:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
appointment so
 
03:51:30.050 --> 03:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
Mrs Richardson told me that that's some
 
03:51:32.450 --> 03:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
of the animal chiropractors are getting
 
03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
some kind of cease and desist letters
 
03:51:35.040 --> 03:51:36.370 align:start position:0%
some kind of cease and desist letters
from

03:51:36.370 --> 03:51:36.380 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:51:38.750 --> 03:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarians I think or maybe perhaps
 
03:51:42.050 --> 03:51:42.060 align:start position:0%
the vet board and so forth so but we the
 
03:51:43.969 --> 03:51:43.979 align:start position:0%
rest of us haven't had any testimony
 
03:51:46.849 --> 03:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
about this issue so can you speak to
 
03:51:49.010 --> 03:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
that so I'm not the only one that knows
 
03:51:50.450 --> 03:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
about this
 
03:51:53.269 --> 03:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen the letter from Ms
 
03:51:55.429 --> 03:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
Richardson so I don't know what she said
 
03:51:56.809 --> 03:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:51:58.370 --> 03:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
my own
 
03:52:00.410 --> 03:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
animal chiropractor who is also a human
 
03:52:02.690 --> 03:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
chiropractor hasn't has informed me I'm
 
03:52:06.170 --> 03:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
sorry that um she has received I think
 
03:52:07.610 --> 03:52:07.620 align:start position:0%
she said something like eight she
 
03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
sentences letters over the years and is
 
03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
she she's the only one I know of
 
03:52:14.150 --> 03:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
personally who has received those
 
03:52:16.370 --> 03:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
letters but I would very much like her
 
03:52:18.590 --> 03:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
to continue to practice and continue to
 
03:52:21.229 --> 03:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
see my dog as well as others
 
03:52:23.450 --> 03:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
um so I I would
 
03:52:26.090 --> 03:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so I would like to have it
 
03:52:28.670 --> 03:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
enshrined in I would like to have her
 
03:52:31.790 --> 03:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
rights to practice enshrined in statute
 
03:52:34.429 --> 03:52:34.439 align:start position:0%
so that so that I don't lose her and
 
03:52:37.910 --> 03:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs benefits Ms Richardson did
 
03:52:40.429 --> 03:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
send letters to the entire committee I
 
03:52:43.190 --> 03:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
remember reading it okay and her concern
 
03:52:46.070 --> 03:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
was largely with the as far as when I
 
03:52:48.010 --> 03:52:48.020 align:start position:0%
read it was largely with the referrals
 
03:52:51.110 --> 03:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
which are not in the amended version of
 
03:52:52.070 --> 03:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:52:55.729 --> 03:52:55.739 align:start position:0%
and so well my follow-up a question to
 
03:52:59.450 --> 03:52:59.460 align:start position:0%
somebody is are these
 
03:52:59.460 --> 03:53:00.050 align:start position:0%
somebody is are these
um

03:53:00.050 --> 03:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:02.150 --> 03:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
animal chiropractors are they being
 
03:53:04.910 --> 03:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
intimidated and being are they ceasing
 
03:53:06.889 --> 03:53:06.899 align:start position:0%
and desisting as the letters are
 
03:53:11.150 --> 03:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
demanding of them is their enforcement
 
03:53:13.610 --> 03:53:13.620 align:start position:0%
does anybody know about this the ceasing
 
03:53:16.790 --> 03:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
and desisting as far as I know they're
 
03:53:18.769 --> 03:53:18.779 align:start position:0%
not they're not ceasing and desisting
 
03:53:21.170 --> 03:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
for a lack of a better term but they are
 
03:53:22.849 --> 03:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
concerned all the time I think it's kind
 
03:53:25.010 --> 03:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
of kept quiet I would love to give my
 
03:53:27.469 --> 03:53:27.479 align:start position:0%
chiropractor referrals but I'm I do it
 
03:53:29.870 --> 03:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
by word of mouth but I wouldn't do it on
 
03:53:31.370 --> 03:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
Yelp or something because I wouldn't
 
03:53:34.370 --> 03:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
want her to get in trouble I I speaking
 
03:53:36.110 --> 03:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
into a microphone you're being recorded
 
03:53:37.510 --> 03:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:53:39.769 --> 03:53:39.779 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
03:53:42.469 --> 03:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
so you know from your personal
 
03:53:44.330 --> 03:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
experience that at least some
 
03:53:46.429 --> 03:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
chiropractors working on animals have
 
03:53:49.150 --> 03:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
gotten cease and desist letters
 
03:53:52.130 --> 03:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
recently from the veterinarian board I
 
03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
don't know who has gotten what when no
 
03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
no no one person one I do know of one
 
03:53:59.330 --> 03:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
yes okay that's
 
03:54:01.490 --> 03:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
that's and it's one I care about a lot
 
03:54:03.530 --> 03:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
because she works on my dog and I want
 
03:54:06.590 --> 03:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:08.809 --> 03:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gould
 
03:54:10.729 --> 03:54:10.739 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:54:12.530 --> 03:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused and trying to
 
03:54:15.170 --> 03:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
understand this and I will say I receive
 
03:54:17.450 --> 03:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
regular Chiropractic Care my former
 
03:54:19.849 --> 03:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
chiropractor who I was with for over 25
 
03:54:23.750 --> 03:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
years was previously the licensor of
 
03:54:26.150 --> 03:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
chiropractors for the State under the
 
03:54:27.889 --> 03:54:27.899 align:start position:0%
governor and
 
03:54:30.170 --> 03:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
um and I know one time my rabbit was not
 
03:54:32.750 --> 03:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay and I had to sneak him in after
 
03:54:32.760 --> 03:54:34.010 align:start position:0%
okay and I had to sneak him in after
hours

03:54:34.010 --> 03:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
hours
 
03:54:36.050 --> 03:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
um to get an adjustment that was many
 
03:54:37.849 --> 03:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
years ago I'm not up on what's Happening
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
Now my confusion with your bill
 
03:54:43.790 --> 03:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
has to do specifically with
 
03:54:47.389 --> 03:54:47.399 align:start position:0%
you want people to be able to not need a
 
03:54:50.630 --> 03:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
veterinarian referral right but what is
 
03:54:52.490 --> 03:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
the part about
 
03:54:56.090 --> 03:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
um examination or certification I'm
 
03:54:58.130 --> 03:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
confused on that part is is this bill
 
03:55:00.410 --> 03:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
saying they will be uncertified
 
03:55:00.420 --> 03:55:02.090 align:start position:0%
saying they will be uncertified
unlicensed

03:55:02.090 --> 03:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
unlicensed
 
03:55:04.910 --> 03:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a chiropractor and and anybody can
 
03:55:07.189 --> 03:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
go to them no it would be animal
 
03:55:09.710 --> 03:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
chiropractors would fall under 316a
 
03:55:12.050 --> 03:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
which is that you have to be certified
 
03:55:12.060 --> 03:55:13.910 align:start position:0%
which is that you have to be certified
and

03:55:13.910 --> 03:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:55:19.330 --> 03:55:19.340 align:start position:0%
um so so your intention is that human
 
03:55:21.530 --> 03:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
chiropractors who treat humans could
 
03:55:23.750 --> 03:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
also treat animals only if they're
 
03:55:25.729 --> 03:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
certified to treat animals from an
 
03:55:29.990 --> 03:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
approved accredited Chiropractic program
 
03:55:32.689 --> 03:55:32.699 align:start position:0%
isn't that I think that's what's in 316.
 
03:55:36.889 --> 03:55:36.899 align:start position:0%
well it doesn't say that it 316a doesn't
 
03:55:39.530 --> 03:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
say certified for animals but right no
 
03:55:41.090 --> 03:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
no I unders that's why I said do you
 
03:55:43.250 --> 03:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
have a licensed chiropractor a few
 
03:55:46.969 --> 03:55:46.979 align:start position:0%
humans and what do you want to do with a
 
03:55:48.969 --> 03:55:48.979 align:start position:0%
with animals
 
03:55:51.410 --> 03:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say they need specific
 
03:55:54.050 --> 03:55:54.060 align:start position:0%
training or a certification or anything
 
03:55:57.110 --> 03:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
my particular dog chiropractor does
 
03:55:59.630 --> 03:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
treat humans but I don't think all
 
03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
animal chiropractors do
 
03:56:05.510 --> 03:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
I yes I would like all I think it's fine
 
03:56:08.630 --> 03:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
for animal chiropractors to be certified
 
03:56:11.090 --> 03:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
from accredited approved Chiropractic
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
schools if you don't say that yeah so I
 
03:56:12.960 --> 03:56:13.790 align:start position:0%
schools if you don't say that yeah so I
should

03:56:13.790 --> 03:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
should
 
03:56:16.670 --> 03:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
include representative yeah I'm going to
 
03:56:18.650 --> 03:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
look up 316a but
 
03:56:21.830 --> 03:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
I if that's already there in 316a it
 
03:56:23.809 --> 03:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
looks like the main thing she's doing is
 
03:56:27.290 --> 03:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
saying that animal chiropractors are not
 
03:56:29.150 --> 03:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
included under the practice of
 
03:56:30.889 --> 03:56:30.899 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine
 
03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
but if they're already being required
 
03:56:35.150 --> 03:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
certification under 316a which I don't
 
03:56:36.349 --> 03:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
know that it is then they're already
 
03:56:38.450 --> 03:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
covered by that but I'm not sure well
 
03:56:40.370 --> 03:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
that's 316a but it wouldn't have to be
 
03:56:41.750 --> 03:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
in per Bill if they're already there
 
03:56:44.150 --> 03:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's but I don't believe it mentions
 
03:56:44.160 --> 03:56:48.010 align:start position:0%
that's but I don't believe it mentions
animals

03:56:48.010 --> 03:56:48.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:53.990 --> 03:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:56.750 --> 03:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
we have Madam chair I I am I right to
 
03:56:58.250 --> 03:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
assume that we have nobody from the
 
03:57:01.010 --> 03:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
veterinarian board here to testify
 
03:57:03.710 --> 03:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
I have no no card from anyone
 
03:57:06.650 --> 03:57:06.660 align:start position:0%
uh we did get a letter an email today
 
03:57:09.290 --> 03:57:09.300 align:start position:0%
from the secretary of the veterinarian
 
03:57:10.849 --> 03:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
board saying
 
03:57:14.389 --> 03:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
we oppose this bill with nothing else
 
03:57:17.330 --> 03:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
have they seen the amendment
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
I cannot say as to what they have seen
 
03:57:23.090 --> 03:57:23.100 align:start position:0%
or not seen okay Madam chair I just want
 
03:57:26.689 --> 03:57:26.699 align:start position:0%
to does it make sense for us to uh ex
 
03:57:29.809 --> 03:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
either extend this or delay this so that
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
we can we can hear from the veterinarian
 
03:57:32.040 --> 03:57:34.189 align:start position:0%
we can we can hear from the veterinarian
board

03:57:34.189 --> 03:57:34.199 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:57:36.229 --> 03:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
that's one thing
 
03:57:38.570 --> 03:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
um the other
 
03:57:42.309 --> 03:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for
 
03:57:45.710 --> 03:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:48.469 --> 03:57:48.479 align:start position:0%
representative shewitt thank you madam
 
03:57:50.750 --> 03:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
chair I'm not sure if this is
 
03:57:53.870 --> 03:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
a question that the representative can
 
03:57:55.910 --> 03:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
answer but
 
03:57:58.790 --> 03:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
um since when I'm gathering she's
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
proposing these practitioners would be
 
03:58:05.349 --> 03:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
under the same statute as human
 
03:58:05.359 --> 03:58:07.150 align:start position:0%
under the same statute as human
chiropractors

03:58:07.150 --> 03:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
chiropractors
 
03:58:09.370 --> 03:58:09.380 align:start position:0%
have we heard from the human
 
03:58:12.410 --> 03:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
chiropractors if they want this practice
 
03:58:15.889 --> 03:58:15.899 align:start position:0%
included under their statute no we have
 
03:58:18.889 --> 03:58:18.899 align:start position:0%
not that as far as I know
 
03:58:20.870 --> 03:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
I have spoken to
 
03:58:23.809 --> 03:58:23.819 align:start position:0%
one person who said the um who
 
03:58:25.429 --> 03:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
represents human chiropractors who said
 
03:58:28.969 --> 03:58:28.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:31.490 --> 03:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
that's faint praise all right thank you
 
03:58:31.500 --> 03:58:33.410 align:start position:0%
that's faint praise all right thank you
other

03:58:33.410 --> 03:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:58:42.950 --> 03:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:45.110 --> 03:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Kurt Ehrenberg state
 
03:58:47.150 --> 03:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
director for the Humane Society of the
 
03:58:50.450 --> 03:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
United States and uh
 
03:58:53.389 --> 03:58:53.399 align:start position:0%
the card says in support I'm we're in
 
03:58:55.729 --> 03:58:55.739 align:start position:0%
support of the idea of removing
 
03:58:55.739 --> 03:58:58.070 align:start position:0%
support of the idea of removing
veterinarians

03:58:58.070 --> 03:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
veterinarians
 
03:59:00.170 --> 03:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
from the process of someone seeking
 
03:59:03.650 --> 03:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
chiropractic care for their animal
 
03:59:07.070 --> 03:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
and uh so if this amendment does that we
 
03:59:09.530 --> 03:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
would support it if there needs to be
 
03:59:12.530 --> 03:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
more thought put into the language or a
 
03:59:14.030 --> 03:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
fix in another
 
03:59:17.510 --> 03:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
part of a statute
 
03:59:20.750 --> 03:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
we would support that most likely
 
03:59:20.760 --> 03:59:21.469 align:start position:0%
we would support that most likely
um

03:59:21.469 --> 03:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:23.990 --> 03:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
and would be interested in following
 
03:59:27.889 --> 03:59:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:29.870 --> 03:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
generally speaking we're in support of
 
03:59:31.130 --> 03:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
the spirit
 
03:59:32.870 --> 03:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
03:59:35.090 --> 03:59:35.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I appreciate that
 
03:59:37.790 --> 03:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
clarification representative Schmidt
 
03:59:40.309 --> 03:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so Kurt
 
03:59:44.090 --> 03:59:44.100 align:start position:0%
the the the problem as I see it is that
 
03:59:46.370 --> 03:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
that these
 
03:59:49.429 --> 03:59:49.439 align:start position:0%
some of the holistic chiropractors are
 
03:59:51.530 --> 03:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
getting cease and desist orders which is
 
03:59:53.750 --> 03:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
intimidating or inhibiting them from
 
03:59:56.809 --> 03:59:56.819 align:start position:0%
doing what they are trained to do
 
04:00:00.410 --> 04:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh want to do what uh the dog owners
 
04:00:03.650 --> 04:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
animal owners want them to do
 
04:00:06.530 --> 04:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
um and if we left them alone
 
04:00:09.469 --> 04:00:09.479 align:start position:0%
um uh or if they were left alone and
 
04:00:11.269 --> 04:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
we're not getting these letters
 
04:00:13.189 --> 04:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
threatening letters
 
04:00:15.290 --> 04:00:15.300 align:start position:0%
uh then we might not have to do anything
 
04:00:18.769 --> 04:00:18.779 align:start position:0%
because it's it's going fine as I
 
04:00:20.750 --> 04:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
understand it from people who are dog
 
04:00:23.510 --> 04:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
owners Mrs Richardson
 
04:00:25.849 --> 04:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
um representative Kelly herself
 
04:00:29.330 --> 04:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
testified to this degree and also Ms
 
04:00:29.340 --> 04:00:30.429 align:start position:0%
testified to this degree and also Ms
Ferrari

04:00:30.429 --> 04:00:30.439 align:start position:0%
Ferrari
 
04:00:33.170 --> 04:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
basically said
 
04:00:35.809 --> 04:00:35.819 align:start position:0%
there's a solution to the problem of
 
04:00:37.790 --> 04:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
animal owners who have pets that need
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
adjustments and you're saying that vets
 
04:00:42.410 --> 04:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
are okay we're not tinkering that's not
 
04:00:44.630 --> 04:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying he's the Humane Society
 
04:00:46.849 --> 04:00:46.859 align:start position:0%
it's not the Humane Society so the
 
04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
Humane Society of the United States is
 
04:00:50.229 --> 04:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
who I represent I'm the state director
 
04:00:52.910 --> 04:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
and and our position is we believe
 
04:00:55.309 --> 04:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
animals should
 
04:00:57.590 --> 04:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
be there should be Chiropractic Care
 
04:00:59.450 --> 04:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
available to the animals
 
04:01:03.469 --> 04:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
without a veterinarian uh in the middle
 
04:01:06.349 --> 04:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
of that equation sorry I misunderstood
 
04:01:10.370 --> 04:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:20.750 --> 04:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:23.269 --> 04:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
04:01:25.969 --> 04:01:25.979 align:start position:0%
the LC DNA committee I'm Simon Thompson
 
04:01:28.070 --> 04:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'm with Sheen Finney Capital group and
 
04:01:30.650 --> 04:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
one of our clients is the New Hampshire
 
04:01:33.950 --> 04:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
State Chiropractic Society I was not
 
04:01:37.550 --> 04:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
intending to testify uh today
 
04:01:40.250 --> 04:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
um as we uh are in we have a neutral
 
04:01:44.210 --> 04:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
position on the bill and from what I can
 
04:01:46.010 --> 04:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
see with this amendment that neutrality
 
04:01:48.130 --> 04:01:48.140 align:start position:0%
would con the neutralness would continue
 
04:01:51.469 --> 04:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
what our concern would be and where we
 
04:01:54.650 --> 04:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
would probably oppose this bill is if
 
04:01:57.950 --> 04:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
you were to open up RSA 316 and the
 
04:02:00.229 --> 04:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
scope of the chiropractic care how this
 
04:02:02.630 --> 04:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
bill's attempting to get what the
 
04:02:05.870 --> 04:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor wants done we are like I said we
 
04:02:08.650 --> 04:02:08.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:12.290 --> 04:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
so thank you could you clarify what you
 
04:02:14.689 --> 04:02:14.699 align:start position:0%
mean by open up 316a well we wouldn't
 
04:02:16.389 --> 04:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
want to have we wouldn't want to have
 
04:02:19.070 --> 04:02:19.080 align:start position:0%
316a at least
 
04:02:20.689 --> 04:02:20.699 align:start position:0%
we want to have we want to have more
 
04:02:22.670 --> 04:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
details on what on if you were to open
 
04:02:27.349 --> 04:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
up RS to a316a and add Animal Care to uh
 
04:02:30.769 --> 04:02:30.779 align:start position:0%
chiropractic care we would have to
 
04:02:34.250 --> 04:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
reconsider our position yeah and I I'm
 
04:02:35.689 --> 04:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
not comfortable right now to say what
 
04:02:37.729 --> 04:02:37.739 align:start position:0%
that would be but that's what I was told
 
04:02:40.729 --> 04:02:40.739 align:start position:0%
from the board of my group
 
04:02:43.729 --> 04:02:43.739 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt thank
 
04:02:46.010 --> 04:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
you so which Bill are you opposing
 
04:02:46.020 --> 04:02:48.229 align:start position:0%
you so which Bill are you opposing
neither

04:02:48.229 --> 04:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
neither
 
04:02:50.150 --> 04:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
didn't you just say you're opposed to
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
the bill no
 
04:02:55.130 --> 04:02:55.140 align:start position:0%
no uh representative Schmidt I was we
 
04:02:58.010 --> 04:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
were neutral on the original Bill and uh
 
04:03:00.110 --> 04:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
as I read this amendment we are still
 
04:03:02.030 --> 04:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
neutral on the amendment because you're
 
04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
not you're not if you're not uh you're
 
04:03:06.590 --> 04:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
you're going after the sponsors going
 
04:03:09.290 --> 04:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
after RSA 332 which I believe is the
 
04:03:13.189 --> 04:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
ah okay
 
04:03:16.910 --> 04:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you other any
 
04:03:19.130 --> 04:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
04:03:21.410 --> 04:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
chair um just looking at 316a it doesn't
 
04:03:23.809 --> 04:03:23.819 align:start position:0%
seem to specify human either it just
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
talks about the procedures that
 
04:03:28.010 --> 04:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
chiropractors deal with so would Animal
 
04:03:30.349 --> 04:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
Care potentially fall under that
 
04:03:31.849 --> 04:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't Define it one way or
 
04:03:35.210 --> 04:03:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:37.250 --> 04:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
uh that's a good question I don't know
 
04:03:39.110 --> 04:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
the answer to it and I apologize no and
 
04:03:40.370 --> 04:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm Mike but I get what
 
04:03:41.870 --> 04:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
you're saying yeah my main concern is if
 
04:03:43.969 --> 04:03:43.979 align:start position:0%
you're concerned about it opening up to
 
04:03:46.370 --> 04:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
Animal Care it may do that without
 
04:03:46.380 --> 04:03:47.809 align:start position:0%
Animal Care it may do that without
specifying

04:03:47.809 --> 04:03:47.819 align:start position:0%
specifying
 
04:03:49.729 --> 04:03:49.739 align:start position:0%
that we're opening it up to Animal Care
 
04:03:52.610 --> 04:03:52.620 align:start position:0%
would you take a position on it then
 
04:03:55.490 --> 04:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
if it's vague if it's vague yes I'd have
 
04:03:58.070 --> 04:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
to check with my my client I apologize
 
04:03:59.570 --> 04:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
like I got that's why I'm in a position
 
04:04:01.130 --> 04:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
to answer that question because we were
 
04:04:02.870 --> 04:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
I came here today kind of under the
 
04:04:06.110 --> 04:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
guise of the underlying bill so okay I
 
04:04:07.250 --> 04:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
just wanted to come up here because
 
04:04:09.290 --> 04:04:09.300 align:start position:0%
there was some questions about you know
 
04:04:12.170 --> 04:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
I think it was you representative what a
 
04:04:13.849 --> 04:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
chiropractors think and although we do
 
04:04:15.469 --> 04:04:15.479 align:start position:0%
not speak for every chiropractor only
 
04:04:17.809 --> 04:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
the members in our association and there
 
04:04:19.370 --> 04:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
is two two different Chiropractic
 
04:04:22.070 --> 04:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
associations to confuse things further
 
04:04:23.689 --> 04:04:23.699 align:start position:0%

barlaroy I am the representative from
 
04:05:08.929 --> 04:05:08.939 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Veterinary Medical
 
04:05:08.939 --> 04:05:10.250 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Veterinary Medical
Association

04:05:10.250 --> 04:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
Association
 
04:05:12.110 --> 04:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
um I highly follow on the heels of the
 
04:05:14.150 --> 04:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
the previous testifier I was not
 
04:05:16.010 --> 04:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak today
 
04:05:17.750 --> 04:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I was kind of just going to be in the
 
04:05:19.849 --> 04:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
background listening um and gaining
 
04:05:19.859 --> 04:05:21.349 align:start position:0%
background listening um and gaining
information

04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:05:24.650 --> 04:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
um to be truthful this is not really in
 
04:05:26.750 --> 04:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
the scope of
 
04:05:29.389 --> 04:05:29.399 align:start position:0%
the veterinary Association right now it
 
04:05:30.710 --> 04:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
is not something that's been on our
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
radar this has not been something that
 
04:05:34.969 --> 04:05:34.979 align:start position:0%
has brought up at the national level at
 
04:05:36.229 --> 04:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
the American Veterinary Medical
 
04:05:39.050 --> 04:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
Association so I'm really not sure to
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
speak to the seasoned assist letters um
 
04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
from our connections to the board of
 
04:05:43.969 --> 04:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine
 
04:05:46.610 --> 04:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
um we are not aware of those sort of
 
04:05:49.729 --> 04:05:49.739 align:start position:0%
things happening in the most recent past
 
04:05:49.739 --> 04:05:50.330 align:start position:0%
things happening in the most recent past
um

04:05:50.330 --> 04:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:51.469 --> 04:05:51.479 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you can get that information
 
04:05:53.170 --> 04:05:53.180 align:start position:0%
from the board of veterinary medicine
 
04:05:55.849 --> 04:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
but we are a separate entity the New
 
04:05:57.469 --> 04:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire VMA is a separate entity from
 
04:05:59.090 --> 04:05:59.100 align:start position:0%
the board
 
04:05:59.100 --> 04:06:00.469 align:start position:0%
the board
um

04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:03.229 --> 04:06:03.239 align:start position:0%
I kind of wanted to answer a question
 
04:06:06.889 --> 04:06:06.899 align:start position:0%
about this whole scope of practice and
 
04:06:06.899 --> 04:06:07.790 align:start position:0%
about this whole scope of practice and
where

04:06:07.790 --> 04:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:06:09.650 --> 04:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic fits into animal
 
04:06:11.750 --> 04:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic as far as the American
 
04:06:13.309 --> 04:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Medical Association is
 
04:06:13.319 --> 04:06:15.050 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Medical Association is
concerned

04:06:15.050 --> 04:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
04:06:17.330 --> 04:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
um animal Chiropractic is practicing
 
04:06:19.429 --> 04:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine so not to muddy the
 
04:06:22.610 --> 04:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
water any more than it already is it is
 
04:06:24.290 --> 04:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
considered the American Veterinary
 
04:06:25.630 --> 04:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
Medical Association does consider
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic adjustments on animals to
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
be practicing veterinary medicine
 
04:06:33.370 --> 04:06:33.380 align:start position:0%
to the extent of what states actually
 
04:06:37.729 --> 04:06:37.739 align:start position:0%
enforce that it is very wide very varied
 
04:06:40.910 --> 04:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
numerous states have exemptions numerous
 
04:06:44.269 --> 04:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
states do not even
 
04:06:44.279 --> 04:06:45.650 align:start position:0%
states do not even
monitor

04:06:45.650 --> 04:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
monitor
 
04:06:47.570 --> 04:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
um the the ongoings of animal
 
04:06:50.389 --> 04:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
Chiropractics but in their policy
 
04:06:51.950 --> 04:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
statement which if you would like a copy
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
of that I can I can surely get up for
 
04:06:54.479 --> 04:06:55.550 align:start position:0%
of that I can I can surely get up for
you

04:06:55.550 --> 04:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:06:56.990 --> 04:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
um that is that is kind of the general
 
04:06:57.000 --> 04:06:59.689 align:start position:0%
um that is that is kind of the general
consensus

04:06:59.689 --> 04:06:59.699 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
04:07:02.030 --> 04:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that's
 
04:07:04.490 --> 04:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
that's your position very good good to
 
04:07:08.330 --> 04:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:10.610 --> 04:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative Simon thank you madam
 
04:07:13.429 --> 04:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
chair so from your perspective
 
04:07:15.170 --> 04:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
um would you be able to articulate any
 
04:07:17.570 --> 04:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
concern that you would have not
 
04:07:19.610 --> 04:07:19.620 align:start position:0%
overseeing Chiropractic from a
 
04:07:27.050 --> 04:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:29.150 --> 04:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you I don't know a lot
 
04:07:31.490 --> 04:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
about chiropractic medicine
 
04:07:35.269 --> 04:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
um I do know that there are aspects of
 
04:07:38.210 --> 04:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Rehabilitation medicine that
 
04:07:38.220 --> 04:07:39.170 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Rehabilitation medicine that
do

04:07:39.170 --> 04:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:07:41.809 --> 04:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
have some manipulations
 
04:07:42.950 --> 04:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
um I know that was brought up about
 
04:07:44.689 --> 04:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
underwater treadmills and and that sort
 
04:07:47.090 --> 04:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
of thing and that is regulated by the
 
04:07:48.769 --> 04:07:48.779 align:start position:0%
practice of veterinary medicine we do
 
04:07:51.429 --> 04:07:51.439 align:start position:0%
have board certified Rehabilitation
 
04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
veterinarians that are out there that do
 
04:07:55.550 --> 04:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
all of that sort of stuff
 
04:07:55.560 --> 04:07:59.450 align:start position:0%
all of that sort of stuff
um

04:07:59.450 --> 04:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:01.550 --> 04:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
I think that it is something that is
 
04:08:03.729 --> 04:08:03.739 align:start position:0%
polarizing in the veterinary community
 
04:08:06.590 --> 04:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
and just like it is in the human medical
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
community so I can't really speak to to
 
04:08:12.349 --> 04:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
that specifically okay thank you
 
04:08:14.929 --> 04:08:14.939 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
04:08:16.790 --> 04:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am Sharon thank you very
 
04:08:19.729 --> 04:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
much for coming up to speak with us uh
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
so I know that there are such things as
 
04:08:26.750 --> 04:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
a large animal veterinarians uh and and
 
04:08:29.090 --> 04:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's a kind of a very different
 
04:08:32.210 --> 04:08:32.220 align:start position:0%
practice in many respects from dogs and
 
04:08:34.910 --> 04:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
cats and so forth and the two people are
 
04:08:38.510 --> 04:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
two the two entities are not the same
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
um but uh
 
04:08:41.040 --> 04:08:42.309 align:start position:0%
um but uh
a

04:08:42.309 --> 04:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
horse for example I'm understanding that
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
horses needs these adjustments
 
04:08:49.429 --> 04:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
themselves sometimes and I'm going like
 
04:08:51.110 --> 04:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want to try to do anything to
 
04:08:52.729 --> 04:08:52.739 align:start position:0%
a horse that the horse didn't
 
04:08:57.830 --> 04:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
specifically ask me to do uh because you
 
04:09:00.889 --> 04:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
know yes large animals so the question
 
04:09:04.490 --> 04:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
is uh and one of the things that we've
 
04:09:06.710 --> 04:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
heard or at least I've heard from people
 
04:09:10.010 --> 04:09:10.020 align:start position:0%
on the telephone is that
 
04:09:14.150 --> 04:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
um they the current practices
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
the animal owner goes to the vet and
 
04:09:20.929 --> 04:09:20.939 align:start position:0%
gets a referral to somebody who does
 
04:09:24.309 --> 04:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
adjustments with a
 
04:09:26.990 --> 04:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
certification of training so they're
 
04:09:29.630 --> 04:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
qualified to do this is is that your
 
04:09:29.640 --> 04:09:31.490 align:start position:0%
qualified to do this is is that your
experience

04:09:31.490 --> 04:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:09:34.490 --> 04:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
in so I've been practicing for almost 17
 
04:09:34.500 --> 04:09:35.630 align:start position:0%
in so I've been practicing for almost 17
years

04:09:35.630 --> 04:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:09:38.090 --> 04:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
um in 17 years I've never given a
 
04:09:41.450 --> 04:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
referral for a chiropractic adjustment
 
04:09:43.250 --> 04:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
um it is not something that comes to me
 
04:09:46.429 --> 04:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
and clients don't ask me to do that we
 
04:09:48.050 --> 04:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
do have a working relationship with the
 
04:09:50.450 --> 04:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
rehabilitators which we don't have to
 
04:09:53.689 --> 04:09:53.699 align:start position:0%
have a referral for that either we
 
04:09:56.050 --> 04:09:56.060 align:start position:0%
we work differently than human medicine
 
04:10:00.110 --> 04:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
if you want to go see a surgeon if you
 
04:10:01.490 --> 04:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
want to see a dermatologist if you see
 
04:10:03.349 --> 04:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
an ophthalmologist you can go on your
 
04:10:04.610 --> 04:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
own accord you do not need to
 
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily referral from a veterinarian
 
04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
do they prefer a referral yes they don't
 
04:10:12.410 --> 04:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
really want people just walking off the
 
04:10:14.330 --> 04:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
street and coming in
 
04:10:16.429 --> 04:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
um however like I said chiropractic
 
04:10:18.229 --> 04:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
medicine I've never asked been asked for
 
04:10:20.090 --> 04:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
a referral I've been asked what my
 
04:10:22.550 --> 04:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
opinion is and I've given that
 
04:10:24.650 --> 04:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:10:27.110 --> 04:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
I've not been asked um I've you know
 
04:10:28.670 --> 04:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
after the fact type of thing so but it's

Diane power I represent the towns of

Brookline Mason and Greenville and

Hillsborough County District 36. for my
 
04:17:20.389 --> 04:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
bill introduction I will address three
 
04:17:23.750 --> 04:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
important questions about this bill what
 
04:17:25.790 --> 04:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
why and how
 
04:17:29.090 --> 04:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
first what does this bill do
 
04:17:32.450 --> 04:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 409 modifies the requirements
 
04:17:35.929 --> 04:17:35.939 align:start position:0%
for non-resident licensure by the Board
 
04:17:40.250 --> 04:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
of barbering cosmetology and Aesthetics
 
04:17:43.250 --> 04:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
second why is this bill needed
 
04:17:45.110 --> 04:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
the problem is
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
under current New Hampshire law licensed
 
04:17:51.290 --> 04:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
barbers cosmetologists and estheticians
 
04:17:54.050 --> 04:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
with out-of-state licenses who want to
 
04:17:56.389 --> 04:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
work in our state are prohibited from
 
04:17:58.130 --> 04:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
working in New Hampshire
 
04:18:00.590 --> 04:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
in order for these licensed
 
04:18:03.290 --> 04:18:03.300 align:start position:0%
professionals to legally work in our
 
04:18:03.300 --> 04:18:04.070 align:start position:0%
professionals to legally work in our
state

04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:18:06.849 --> 04:18:06.859 align:start position:0%
they must first successfully navigate
 
04:18:10.010 --> 04:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
additional requirements for New
 
04:18:12.050 --> 04:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to recognize their current
 
04:18:15.410 --> 04:18:15.420 align:start position:0%
valid professional licenses
 
04:18:18.889 --> 04:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
clearly this is both unnecessary and
 
04:18:18.899 --> 04:18:20.090 align:start position:0%
clearly this is both unnecessary and
burdensome

04:18:20.090 --> 04:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
burdensome
 
04:18:23.090 --> 04:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
in light of the fact that these licensed
 
04:18:25.510 --> 04:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
professionals have successfully
 
04:18:28.090 --> 04:18:28.100 align:start position:0%
completed their education
 
04:18:30.790 --> 04:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
obtained the required training hours
 
04:18:34.490 --> 04:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
have passed a professional licensing
 
04:18:37.729 --> 04:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
exam have met all of the standards and
 
04:18:41.269 --> 04:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
requirements of a State Licensing Board
 
04:18:44.229 --> 04:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
and they possess the necessary
 
04:18:47.389 --> 04:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
credentials to provide services to
 
04:18:50.630 --> 04:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
clients this red tape hinders Beauty
 
04:18:53.389 --> 04:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
Professionals in new to New Hampshire by
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
delaying their ability
 
04:18:58.309 --> 04:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
to work and earn a living which in turn
 
04:19:00.889 --> 04:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
hurts our economy
 
04:19:03.830 --> 04:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
third how does this bill address the
 
04:19:06.889 --> 04:19:06.899 align:start position:0%
problem this bill provides a simple
 
04:19:06.899 --> 04:19:08.330 align:start position:0%
problem this bill provides a simple
solution

04:19:08.330 --> 04:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
solution
 
04:19:11.150 --> 04:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
first it amends current statute to
 
04:19:14.330 --> 04:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
recognize current valid out-of-state
 
04:19:17.570 --> 04:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
barbering cosmetology and aesthetic
 
04:19:21.530 --> 04:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
licenses and second it repeals the vague
 
04:19:25.130 --> 04:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
quote substantially equivalent unquote
 
04:19:29.290 --> 04:19:29.300 align:start position:0%
language in current statute
 
04:19:32.090 --> 04:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
referencing licensing requirements of
 
04:19:35.110 --> 04:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
other states this repeal is practical
 
04:19:38.330 --> 04:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
since requiring licensed professionals
 
04:19:40.870 --> 04:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
to get additional educational hours
 
04:19:43.790 --> 04:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
before they can legally work in our
 
04:19:47.870 --> 04:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
state is an unnecessary barrier to
 
04:19:47.880 --> 04:19:49.189 align:start position:0%
state is an unnecessary barrier to
employment

04:19:49.189 --> 04:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:19:51.710 --> 04:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
these simple changes proposed by this
 
04:19:55.370 --> 04:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
bill streamlines the current process not
 
04:19:57.889 --> 04:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
only for professionals new to our state
 
04:20:01.189 --> 04:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
but it also simplifies the process for
 
04:20:04.429 --> 04:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
oplc and the Board of barbering
 
04:20:07.370 --> 04:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and Aesthetics and
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
additionally it enables out-of-state
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
licensed Beauty professionals to more
 
04:20:14.650 --> 04:20:14.660 align:start position:0%
easily become licensed in New Hampshire
 
04:20:18.889 --> 04:20:18.899 align:start position:0%
without any unnecessary red tape
 
04:20:23.450 --> 04:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
in conclusion this bill applies only to
 
04:20:26.510 --> 04:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
licensed Beauty professionals holding a
 
04:20:29.750 --> 04:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
current valid out-of-state license this
 
04:20:32.090 --> 04:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
bill requires the Board of barbering
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and Aesthetics to recognize
 
04:20:37.490 --> 04:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
these out-of-state licenses without
 
04:20:39.830 --> 04:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
additional requirements
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
this bill enables already licensed
 
04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
Beauty professionals to be able to work
 
04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%

04:20:50.809 --> 04:20:50.819 align:start position:0%
tape and lastly this bill benefits
 
04:20:54.650 --> 04:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
workers employers and consumers
 
04:20:58.010 --> 04:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
by creating greater access to skilled
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
labor and Beauty services in the granite
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
state which boosts our economy this
 
04:21:06.110 --> 04:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
concludes my bill introduction Madam

chair and I'm happy to take any
 
04:21:07.500 --> 04:21:09.530 align:start position:0%
chair and I'm happy to take any
questions

04:21:09.530 --> 04:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:21:11.150 --> 04:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:21:11.160 --> 04:21:11.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:21:11.870 --> 04:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:13.550 --> 04:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
04:21:13.560 --> 04:21:14.570 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

04:21:14.570 --> 04:21:14.580 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:21:17.269 --> 04:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
representative Broda
 
04:21:20.809 --> 04:21:20.819 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning good afternoon
 
04:21:24.650 --> 04:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
um in last year I think it was we passed
 
04:21:25.610 --> 04:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
04:21:28.510 --> 04:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
that house bill 1560
 
04:21:31.849 --> 04:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
that allowed non-residents applying for
 
04:21:33.590 --> 04:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
a license
 
04:21:35.689 --> 04:21:35.699 align:start position:0%
for the Board of barbering cosmetology
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
and Aesthetics
 
04:21:39.830 --> 04:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
they could have a New Hampshire license
 
04:21:43.010 --> 04:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
if their license was from a state which
 
04:21:45.530 --> 04:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
had substantially equivalent or higher
 
04:21:48.349 --> 04:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
than those of New Hampshire
 
04:21:51.290 --> 04:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
how does this bill differ from that
 
04:21:52.250 --> 04:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:21:52.260 --> 04:21:53.630 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

04:21:53.630 --> 04:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
um this this bill here before you is a
 
04:22:00.590 --> 04:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
refiling of house bill 1560. it passed
 
04:22:03.050 --> 04:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
this committee with a recommendation of
 
04:22:04.429 --> 04:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
ought to pass it went to the house floor
 
04:22:07.010 --> 04:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
passed went to the Senate
 
04:22:10.090 --> 04:22:10.100 align:start position:0%
and that's where it um
 
04:22:13.550 --> 04:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
was voted interim study so therefore
 
04:22:17.630 --> 04:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
this year I'm refiling the bill
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:22:24.650 --> 04:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:26.570 --> 04:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
so when you're saying you're refiling
 
04:22:29.210 --> 04:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
the bill you want to strike
 
04:22:32.030 --> 04:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that the board shall license
 
04:22:35.990 --> 04:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
any applicant who is similarly licensed
 
04:22:38.570 --> 04:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
and you want to strike the language that
 
04:22:40.490 --> 04:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
the other states licensing requirements
 
04:22:43.010 --> 04:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
are substantially equivalent or higher
 
04:22:44.990 --> 04:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
than those of this state you want to
 
04:22:46.969 --> 04:22:46.979 align:start position:0%
strike that language correct that is
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
correct and that's how the bill language
 
04:22:51.889 --> 04:22:51.899 align:start position:0%
reads to to Omit that language because
 
04:22:56.269 --> 04:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary additional red tape for
 
04:22:59.630 --> 04:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
a licensed professional who holds a
 
04:23:01.969 --> 04:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
current valid license albeit from
 
04:23:05.090 --> 04:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
another state last question follow up so
 
04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
if someone has a license that has a
 
04:23:10.370 --> 04:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
minimum requirement to mistake
 
04:23:13.070 --> 04:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
that is quite different from ours
 
04:23:15.469 --> 04:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
your bill would allow
 
04:23:17.570 --> 04:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
that person to hold a New Hampshire
 
04:23:20.689 --> 04:23:20.699 align:start position:0%
license correct
 
04:23:22.189 --> 04:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:23:22.199 --> 04:23:24.110 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
representative

04:23:24.110 --> 04:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:23:27.170 --> 04:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
we are talking about individuals who
 
04:23:28.849 --> 04:23:28.859 align:start position:0%
hold a
 
04:23:31.250 --> 04:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
barbering cosmetology and aesthetic
 
04:23:33.830 --> 04:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
license from another state and yes
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
States requirements to obtain a
 
04:23:39.710 --> 04:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
professional license it does vary from
 
04:23:43.189 --> 04:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
state to state and additionally I would
 
04:23:45.590 --> 04:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
also add that many people
 
04:23:47.809 --> 04:23:47.819 align:start position:0%
these professionals that come from other
 
04:23:49.729 --> 04:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
states they have
 
04:23:51.650 --> 04:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
work experience
 
04:23:55.070 --> 04:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
so that is correct in New Hampshire the
 
04:23:57.050 --> 04:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
required the required educational hours
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
are 1500.
 
04:24:03.170 --> 04:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
the educational hours in other states
 
04:24:06.469 --> 04:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
there that they do vary
 
04:24:06.479 --> 04:24:08.090 align:start position:0%
there that they do vary
and

04:24:08.090 --> 04:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:13.389 --> 04:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
for example in the state of Vermont
 
04:24:16.670 --> 04:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
their required educational hours are one
 
04:24:16.680 --> 04:24:18.710 align:start position:0%
their required educational hours are one
thousand

04:24:18.710 --> 04:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
04:24:22.250 --> 04:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
and I have an expert witness who will
 
04:24:25.610 --> 04:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
testify after me who can speak more
 
04:24:28.429 --> 04:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
specifically to the numbers of hours
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
required in other states but it ranges
 
04:24:33.469 --> 04:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
from a thousand
 
04:24:36.290 --> 04:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
um some have there's only based on
 
04:24:38.150 --> 04:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
current research
 
04:24:43.729 --> 04:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
that was updated in November 2020 there
 
04:24:47.170 --> 04:24:47.180 align:start position:0%
the states in our area there are seven
 
04:24:50.769 --> 04:24:50.779 align:start position:0%
and their required hours
 
04:24:53.389 --> 04:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
vary from one thousand to fifteen
 
04:24:56.030 --> 04:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
hundred so yes some of them are similar
 
04:25:00.769 --> 04:25:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:03.650 --> 04:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
and I would also like to note
 
04:25:06.410 --> 04:25:06.420 align:start position:0%
um last year when I introduced that this
 
04:25:10.250 --> 04:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
bill that statistic was five states only
 
04:25:13.610 --> 04:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
five states in the country so that's 50
 
04:25:16.849 --> 04:25:16.859 align:start position:0%
states plus the District of Columbia had
 
04:25:19.969 --> 04:25:19.979 align:start position:0%
less educational hours in the least were
 
04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
a thousand
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
other data points having less were
 
04:25:25.849 --> 04:25:25.859 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred
 
04:25:28.849 --> 04:25:28.859 align:start position:0%
so um the the point I wanted to make
 
04:25:32.630 --> 04:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
with regard to the updated data that was
 
04:25:32.640 --> 04:25:34.250 align:start position:0%
with regard to the updated data that was
um

04:25:34.250 --> 04:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:37.010 --> 04:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
in a published report by The Institute
 
04:25:41.090 --> 04:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
of just Justice in November 2020 there
 
04:25:43.010 --> 04:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
are now seven states that have less
 
04:25:45.050 --> 04:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
hours and I would note and like I said
 
04:25:48.110 --> 04:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
the expert with witness can speak more
 
04:25:49.610 --> 04:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
to this
 
04:25:51.670 --> 04:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
based on my
 
04:25:54.229 --> 04:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
observation and Analysis of the data
 
04:25:57.110 --> 04:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's because these states decreased
 
04:26:00.110 --> 04:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
their required hours in order to get a
 
04:26:02.090 --> 04:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
license if you understand the point that
 
04:26:05.269 --> 04:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:05.279 --> 04:26:07.189 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:08.990 --> 04:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
04:26:11.149 --> 04:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
representative Simon
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:26:15.050 --> 04:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative power for taking my
 
04:26:15.060 --> 04:26:16.189 align:start position:0%
representative power for taking my
question

04:26:16.189 --> 04:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:26:18.530 --> 04:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that the
 
04:26:20.870 --> 04:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
the state of Vermont requires a thousand
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
hours in order to get their
 
04:26:25.070 --> 04:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
certification is that correct that is
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
correct from The Institute for justice
 
04:26:32.210 --> 04:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
their um published report November 2020.
 
04:26:34.610 --> 04:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
um that being the case and then being a
 
04:26:38.450 --> 04:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
neighbor to our state is there any
 
04:26:40.189 --> 04:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
concern that if this bill is passed in
 
04:26:42.889 --> 04:26:42.899 align:start position:0%
its present form that people will go to
 
04:26:44.210 --> 04:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
the state of Vermont to get their
 
04:26:45.769 --> 04:26:45.779 align:start position:0%
licensure instead of getting it in the
 
04:26:47.269 --> 04:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to undercut it by
 
04:26:49.189 --> 04:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
500 hours and then just come back here
 
04:26:50.389 --> 04:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
to work
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:26:53.030 --> 04:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative that's an interesting
 
04:26:56.269 --> 04:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
question I suppose that you know
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
that that is a possibility but
 
04:27:02.889 --> 04:27:02.899 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion is I don't see people
 
04:27:05.269 --> 04:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
relocating to the state of Vermont in
 
04:27:07.610 --> 04:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
order to obtain a license and and then
 
04:27:10.969 --> 04:27:10.979 align:start position:0%
relocate because moving and relocating a
 
04:27:14.809 --> 04:27:14.819 align:start position:0%
household that costs money so I I while
 
04:27:16.849 --> 04:27:16.859 align:start position:0%
it's possible I I feel that it's
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
improbable to to be of any consequence
 
04:27:21.359 --> 04:27:22.210 align:start position:0%
improbable to to be of any consequence
um

04:27:22.210 --> 04:27:22.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:24.050 --> 04:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
last one
 
04:27:25.670 --> 04:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
um would there be any benefit to
 
04:27:27.110 --> 04:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
consider just dropping New Hampshire's
 
04:27:30.410 --> 04:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
requirements to the Thousand hours would
 
04:27:32.510 --> 04:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
that be accomplishing essentially the
 
04:27:36.950 --> 04:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:38.689 --> 04:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
the question representative
 
04:27:38.699 --> 04:27:40.250 align:start position:0%
the question representative
um

04:27:40.250 --> 04:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:42.469 --> 04:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting question
 
04:27:44.689 --> 04:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
um that that is not what the bill
 
04:27:47.389 --> 04:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
um is before you I think it's a lot more
 
04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
simpler and you know straightforward to
 
04:27:52.070 --> 04:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
accomplish what I am trying to
 
04:27:53.689 --> 04:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
accomplish through the language as
 
04:27:55.790 --> 04:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
written that would be another bill for
 
04:27:57.950 --> 04:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
another year thank you representative
 
04:27:57.960 --> 04:27:59.210 align:start position:0%
another year thank you representative
Gerhart

04:27:59.210 --> 04:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
Gerhart
 
04:28:01.309 --> 04:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just a quick
 
04:28:03.229 --> 04:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
question for you is State here defined
 
04:28:05.210 --> 04:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
as also or does it also Encompass
 
04:28:06.769 --> 04:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
territories would this Encompass
 
04:28:08.990 --> 04:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
somebody being certified in Puerto Rico
 
04:28:10.969 --> 04:28:10.979 align:start position:0%
or elsewhere
 
04:28:13.070 --> 04:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
um could you say DC so DC is not a state
 
04:28:14.630 --> 04:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious thank you no I
 
04:28:16.729 --> 04:28:16.739 align:start position:0%
understand I was just simply site thank
 
04:28:18.830 --> 04:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative I
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
was um simply stating
 
04:28:21.359 --> 04:28:22.490 align:start position:0%
was um simply stating
um

04:28:22.490 --> 04:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:25.670 --> 04:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
the data from from the report
 
04:28:29.389 --> 04:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
so I can't answer that question because
 
04:28:32.050 --> 04:28:32.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not a an
 
04:28:35.570 --> 04:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
employment attorney so
 
04:28:37.370 --> 04:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
um perhaps somebody else you could ask
 
04:28:40.250 --> 04:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
the same question of another witness so
 
04:28:42.649 --> 04:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
I would say that based on the fact that
 
04:28:46.130 --> 04:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
it is contained in the report that it DC
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
would would be included
 
04:28:50.689 --> 04:28:50.699 align:start position:0%
um as a state but then again I'm not
 
04:28:52.490 --> 04:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
clear on the definitions
 
04:28:55.370 --> 04:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
and if there is a question about that of
 
04:28:59.469 --> 04:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
course oplc and the the board would be
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
scrutinizing that
 
04:29:02.929 --> 04:29:02.939 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that I can't give a better
 
04:29:02.939 --> 04:29:03.830 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that I can't give a better
answer

04:29:03.830 --> 04:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:29:04.729 --> 04:29:04.739 align:start position:0%
all right that's fine thank you
 
04:29:04.739 --> 04:29:07.130 align:start position:0%
all right that's fine thank you
representative

04:29:07.130 --> 04:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:29:08.929 --> 04:29:08.939 align:start position:0%
representative power thank you for being
 
04:29:11.030 --> 04:29:11.040 align:start position:0%

concise introduction to the bill I love

the what why and how my question to you
 
04:29:19.370 --> 04:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
is do you have any metrics or any idea
 
04:29:23.389 --> 04:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
on how many new licensures come in to
 
04:29:25.370 --> 04:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire from other
 
04:29:28.010 --> 04:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
states currently today thank you thank
 
04:29:29.630 --> 04:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative that
 
04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
that that's that's a good question
 
04:29:34.370 --> 04:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
that's interesting and in preparation
 
04:29:36.590 --> 04:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
for this bill I did not
 
04:29:40.189 --> 04:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
um obtain that that information and I
 
04:29:42.050 --> 04:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
would be happy to do the research to
 
04:29:44.389 --> 04:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
reach out to oplc and get that
 
04:29:48.590 --> 04:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
information for you if that would be um
 
04:29:48.600 --> 04:29:50.030 align:start position:0%
information for you if that would be um
helpful

04:29:50.030 --> 04:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
04:29:52.670 --> 04:29:52.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you it would be any other
 
04:29:54.889 --> 04:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
questions representative Schmidt
 
04:29:59.809 --> 04:29:59.819 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so uh
 
04:30:02.570 --> 04:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
I'm conflicted with regard to the
 
04:30:04.790 --> 04:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
language that you're striking the
 
04:30:07.849 --> 04:30:07.859 align:start position:0%
language you're not striking uh the line
 
04:30:10.670 --> 04:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
two says any applicant who is similarly
 
04:30:10.680 --> 04:30:11.990 align:start position:0%
two says any applicant who is similarly
licensed

04:30:11.990 --> 04:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
04:30:13.969 --> 04:30:13.979 align:start position:0%
uh what does that mean if you're
 
04:30:16.389 --> 04:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
striking the
 
04:30:19.790 --> 04:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
language in lines three and four
 
04:30:22.910 --> 04:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
and what it was I'll ask you that first
 
04:30:25.370 --> 04:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
what is similarly licensed in line two
 
04:30:29.450 --> 04:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
mean if you strike the language defining
 
04:30:32.030 --> 04:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
what similarly means in lines three and
 
04:30:32.040 --> 04:30:33.950 align:start position:0%
what similarly means in lines three and
four

04:30:33.950 --> 04:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:30:34.849 --> 04:30:34.859 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:30:38.570 --> 04:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
representative so similarly licensed in
 
04:30:41.809 --> 04:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
implies that it's an individual who has
 
04:30:44.269 --> 04:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
a barbering cosmetology an aesthetic
 
04:30:46.729 --> 04:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
license that's
 
04:30:49.550 --> 04:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
current and valid from another state
 
04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:56.689 --> 04:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
may I say to representative Schmidt it
 
04:30:58.309 --> 04:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
means that if you have a manicurist
 
04:31:00.530 --> 04:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
license for Massachusetts you get a
 
04:31:03.170 --> 04:31:03.180 align:start position:0%
manicurist license in New Hampshire if
 
04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
you have an esthetician license you get
 
04:31:07.130 --> 04:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
an esthetician license
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
not you don't get okay the overall one
 
04:31:12.830 --> 04:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
is is that correct for your attention
 
04:31:15.649 --> 04:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair chairman that's
 
04:31:18.110 --> 04:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
that's what I was um driving at
 
04:31:21.410 --> 04:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
follow-up then thank you okay so if you
 
04:31:23.450 --> 04:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
strike the language in lines three and
 
04:31:23.460 --> 04:31:24.830 align:start position:0%
strike the language in lines three and
four

04:31:24.830 --> 04:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
um then you you got the uh the
 
04:31:32.090 --> 04:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
requirement that they have the kind of
 
04:31:35.090 --> 04:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
training that we have in this state so
 
04:31:38.450 --> 04:31:38.460 align:start position:0%
how low can you go
 
04:31:39.530 --> 04:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:31:41.570 --> 04:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
representative Could you um rephrase
 
04:31:44.090 --> 04:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
that question uh it's I'm sure if you if
 
04:31:47.030 --> 04:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
you take out the language in lines three
 
04:31:50.870 --> 04:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
and four then uh
 
04:31:53.030 --> 04:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
then you're opening the door to anyone
 
04:31:55.969 --> 04:31:55.979 align:start position:0%
who has a license in any one of these
 
04:31:58.010 --> 04:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
professions regardless of whether
 
04:32:01.070 --> 04:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
they're training and and qualifications
 
04:32:03.830 --> 04:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
are equivalent to what we have in this
 
04:32:03.840 --> 04:32:04.969 align:start position:0%
are equivalent to what we have in this
state

04:32:04.969 --> 04:32:04.979 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:32:07.189 --> 04:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
do not
 
04:32:09.649 --> 04:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
to what was that last part I couldn't do
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
you not do what I just said if you take
 
04:32:16.550 --> 04:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
away the re the requirements in lines
 
04:32:20.450 --> 04:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
three and four then you open the door to
 
04:32:23.630 --> 04:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
anyone who has a license from any other
 
04:32:23.640 --> 04:32:25.370 align:start position:0%
anyone who has a license from any other
state

04:32:25.370 --> 04:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:32:27.050 --> 04:32:27.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yes
 
04:32:28.910 --> 04:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative that is the whole point
 
04:32:31.250 --> 04:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
of of this bill that's in front of you
 
04:32:33.290 --> 04:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
it's to
 
04:32:33.300 --> 04:32:34.910 align:start position:0%
it's to
allow

04:32:34.910 --> 04:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
allow
 
04:32:37.689 --> 04:32:37.699 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to recognize
 
04:32:41.689 --> 04:32:41.699 align:start position:0%
a valid current license
 
04:32:44.450 --> 04:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
from another state and the point being
 
04:32:48.229 --> 04:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
is that these licensed professionals
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
in other states
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
they hold a license they've gone through
 
04:32:53.630 --> 04:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
all the requirements they've gone
 
04:32:55.309 --> 04:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
through education they've gone through
 
04:32:57.590 --> 04:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
the training they've sat and they
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
they've passed a licensing exam they've
 
04:33:02.030 --> 04:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
met all the standards and all the
 
04:33:05.269 --> 04:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
requirements of a State Licensing body
 
04:33:08.449 --> 04:33:08.459 align:start position:0%
and they all therefore they possess the
 
04:33:12.590 --> 04:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
necessary credentials to legally work in
 
04:33:13.849 --> 04:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
a state
 
04:33:13.859 --> 04:33:14.510 align:start position:0%
a state
um

04:33:14.510 --> 04:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:17.869 --> 04:33:17.879 align:start position:0%
to be clear heads of hair don't vary
 
04:33:20.810 --> 04:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
from from state to state hair is hair
 
04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
and if it's you know
 
04:33:26.750 --> 04:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
if it's legal for someone to provide
 
04:33:30.470 --> 04:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
Beauty services to to a client in state
 
04:33:30.480 --> 04:33:31.609 align:start position:0%
Beauty services to to a client in state
a

04:33:31.609 --> 04:33:31.619 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:33:36.410 --> 04:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:39.410 --> 04:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
permit that same
 
04:33:41.990 --> 04:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
Beauty professional that is licensed to
 
04:33:44.150 --> 04:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
to provide that same service
 
04:33:47.631 --> 04:33:47.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll remember that thank you
 
04:33:54.410 --> 04:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
the representative Lucas thank you and
 
04:33:54.420 --> 04:33:55.789 align:start position:0%
the representative Lucas thank you and
uh

04:33:55.789 --> 04:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:57.170 --> 04:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
which might help with that and also
 
04:33:59.689 --> 04:33:59.699 align:start position:0%
answer my question is uh and maybe
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
someone else can answer it more
 
04:34:02.570 --> 04:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
accurately but as far as you know what
 
04:34:04.670 --> 04:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
is the lowest number of hours required
 
04:34:08.510 --> 04:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
to get such a license in uh any state in
 
04:34:10.189 --> 04:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
the United States
 
04:34:12.830 --> 04:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
or DC for that matter thank you for the
 
04:34:14.330 --> 04:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
question so
 
04:34:17.750 --> 04:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
um based on my
 
04:34:20.810 --> 04:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
cursory analysis here of this large
 
04:34:25.429 --> 04:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:27.470 --> 04:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
I would answer that question based on
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
the data that I pulled that it's a
 
04:34:30.769 --> 04:34:30.779 align:start position:0%
thousand hours
 
04:34:33.830 --> 04:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
that being said there is a an expert
 
04:34:37.250 --> 04:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
witness who is from The Institute for
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:45.590 --> 04:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative Fitzpatrick
 
04:34:49.970 --> 04:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair can you tell me in
 
04:34:51.369 --> 04:34:51.379 align:start position:0%
this group
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
how many states
 
04:34:57.470 --> 04:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
would be reciprocal to New Hampshire in
 
04:34:59.269 --> 04:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
other words how many states would have
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
this similar courtesy to our licensees
 
04:35:06.410 --> 04:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:35:09.949 --> 04:35:09.959 align:start position:0%
representative so if I might rephrase
 
04:35:11.631 --> 04:35:11.641 align:start position:0%
your questions so that I make sure that
 
04:35:13.670 --> 04:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
I understand it your question is you're
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
asking how many other states
 
04:35:20.570 --> 04:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
in the United States have a similar bill
 
04:35:23.570 --> 04:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
on the books is that correct I do not
 
04:35:25.670 --> 04:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that I can find that
 
04:35:26.990 --> 04:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
out if you would like
 
04:35:29.570 --> 04:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
uh I would thank you okay and thank you
 
04:35:30.890 --> 04:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
04:35:33.230 --> 04:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:35:35.810 --> 04:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative power
 
04:35:50.990 --> 04:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:53.449 --> 04:35:53.459 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair for the
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
record my name is Rosemarie wrong and
 
04:35:57.109 --> 04:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
I'm a representative for Hillsboro 12
 
04:35:59.390 --> 04:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
which is the town of Merrimack
 
04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
I enthusiastically signed on as a
 
04:36:05.269 --> 04:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill because I feel
 
04:36:07.910 --> 04:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
that under the current legit the current
 
04:36:10.789 --> 04:36:10.799 align:start position:0%
requirements is it's placing an undue
 
04:36:15.470 --> 04:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
burden on uh workers who tend to be at
 
04:36:17.570 --> 04:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
the low or medium income levels they're
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
they're coming into New Hampshire they
 
04:36:21.289 --> 04:36:21.299 align:start position:0%
want to continue their profession and
 
04:36:23.269 --> 04:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
yet we place these obstacles in front of
 
04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
them that they cannot get a license
 
04:36:28.789 --> 04:36:28.799 align:start position:0%
until they if they don't meet the same
 
04:36:31.131 --> 04:36:31.141 align:start position:0%
requirements of original license holders
 
04:36:33.470 --> 04:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we don't see that in
 
04:36:36.670 --> 04:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
other professions for example in nursing
 
04:36:40.010 --> 04:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
we accept licenses from out of state as
 
04:36:42.410 --> 04:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
we're part of a compact with 30 other
 
04:36:46.390 --> 04:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
states but we hold people
 
04:36:49.369 --> 04:36:49.379 align:start position:0%
hair stylists Barbers to a much higher
 
04:36:51.170 --> 04:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
standard than those that are in life and
 
04:36:54.529 --> 04:36:54.539 align:start position:0%
death situations so I I believe that
 
04:36:57.709 --> 04:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
that is discriminatory based on the
 
04:37:01.010 --> 04:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
level of expertise and the type of job
 
04:37:03.650 --> 04:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
and income someone's going to hold I
 
04:37:05.330 --> 04:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
believe that if they have if they've
 
04:37:07.250 --> 04:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
gone through licensing requirements
 
04:37:09.170 --> 04:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
remember they have to hold a license in
 
04:37:11.929 --> 04:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
another state I believe we should honor
 
04:37:14.090 --> 04:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
that other State's standards of
 
04:37:14.100 --> 04:37:15.429 align:start position:0%
that other State's standards of
Licensing

04:37:15.429 --> 04:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
Licensing
 
04:37:18.349 --> 04:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
for as representative power mentioned in
 
04:37:21.490 --> 04:37:21.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we require 1500 hours of
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
training but many other states it's only
 
04:37:29.689 --> 04:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
a thousand and there's no testing so for
 
04:37:33.051 --> 04:37:33.061 align:start position:0%
other states so there's we may we don't
 
04:37:35.330 --> 04:37:35.340 align:start position:0%
even test other you know people coming
 
04:37:37.070 --> 04:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
in with an out of state to make sure
 
04:37:40.189 --> 04:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
that they're working to our standards we
 
04:37:43.990 --> 04:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
don't have stated standards for whatever
 
04:37:47.209 --> 04:37:47.219 align:start position:0%
professional school they went to so it's
 
04:37:50.209 --> 04:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
purely by hours so 15 hours in New
 
04:37:50.219 --> 04:37:50.949 align:start position:0%
purely by hours so 15 hours in New
Hampshire

04:37:50.949 --> 04:37:50.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
may be equivalent two thousand hours
 
04:37:56.449 --> 04:37:56.459 align:start position:0%
training in another state I don't know
 
04:37:58.131 --> 04:37:58.141 align:start position:0%
if it is true or not but that
 
04:38:00.849 --> 04:38:00.859 align:start position:0%
possibility still exists exist
 
04:38:04.189 --> 04:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
in fact and I hope someone from
 
04:38:06.650 --> 04:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
licensing can can answer this question
 
04:38:10.189 --> 04:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
but one of the things I noticed in doing
 
04:38:12.051 --> 04:38:12.061 align:start position:0%
research is that there are several
 
04:38:14.269 --> 04:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
professions where we might extend a
 
04:38:17.150 --> 04:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
conditional license or we may allow
 
04:38:18.949 --> 04:38:18.959 align:start position:0%
someone with a license from another
 
04:38:20.570 --> 04:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
state to come into New Hampshire and
 
04:38:23.330 --> 04:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
take our exam but we don't extend that
 
04:38:26.209 --> 04:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
convenience to in the cosmetology
 
04:38:29.090 --> 04:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
profession they would have to go through
 
04:38:31.609 --> 04:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
that additional training in order to get
 
04:38:34.310 --> 04:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
our license because of that lack of if
 
04:38:36.670 --> 04:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
there's original license date does not
 
04:38:39.490 --> 04:38:39.500 align:start position:0%
stand up to our reciproc
 
04:38:42.349 --> 04:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
reciprocity requirements
 
04:38:46.429 --> 04:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
so um I I be those are really my
 
04:38:49.551 --> 04:38:49.561 align:start position:0%
concerns I feel that as representative
 
04:38:51.170 --> 04:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
Powers said we need to do what's
 
04:38:53.150 --> 04:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
possible to ensure that professionals
 
04:38:56.689 --> 04:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
can come and work in New Hampshire make
 
04:38:59.570 --> 04:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
an income pay taxes support our
 
04:39:02.150 --> 04:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
communities without undue restrictions
 
04:39:04.910 --> 04:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
and obstacles for them to do so I would
 
04:39:07.250 --> 04:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions you
 
04:39:07.260 --> 04:39:07.970 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions you
have

04:39:07.970 --> 04:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
04:39:13.369 --> 04:39:13.379 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:16.131 --> 04:39:16.141 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
04:39:19.369 --> 04:39:19.379 align:start position:0%
thank you we are focusing on the number
 
04:39:23.869 --> 04:39:23.879 align:start position:0%
of hours involved uh but it's not merely
 
04:39:26.949 --> 04:39:26.959 align:start position:0%
the number of hours it says
 
04:39:30.830 --> 04:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements are substantially
 
04:39:33.650 --> 04:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
equivalent to or higher than those of
 
04:39:35.810 --> 04:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
this state it's not just the number of
 
04:39:37.630 --> 04:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
hours that are involved
 
04:39:40.070 --> 04:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
and that is the only reference that's
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
been made so I wonder when we strike the
 
04:39:45.590 --> 04:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
language we're striking all the language
 
04:39:48.650 --> 04:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
and all the implications of removing
 
04:39:48.660 --> 04:39:49.730 align:start position:0%
and all the implications of removing
those

04:39:49.730 --> 04:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:39:52.610 --> 04:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
presently statutory words
 
04:39:57.110 --> 04:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
am I correct well my response would be
 
04:39:59.630 --> 04:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
that in order for someone to get a
 
04:40:01.788 --> 04:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
license at any other state there's going
 
04:40:04.788 --> 04:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
to be somehow a minimum hours and
 
04:40:07.788 --> 04:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
from the research I've done and I'm
 
04:40:09.590 --> 04:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't have a list with me but
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
there's some states it's a thousand
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
hours some that's two thousand hours of
 
04:40:16.368 --> 04:40:16.378 align:start position:0%
training of it's typically classroom
 
04:40:18.110 --> 04:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
training so
 
04:40:21.410 --> 04:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't get to the standards of
 
04:40:23.448 --> 04:40:23.458 align:start position:0%
that classroom training someone may be
 
04:40:26.390 --> 04:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
in a classroom for a thousand hours and
 
04:40:30.110 --> 04:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
get a much higher level of preparation
 
04:40:32.810 --> 04:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
for that for their position as somebody
 
04:40:36.350 --> 04:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
maybe in 2000 hours someplace else but
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
it does allow us to recognize licenses
 
04:40:43.910 --> 04:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
from other states and other states do
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:49.910 --> 04:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
I hope that answered your question
 
04:40:51.890 --> 04:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
04:40:53.390 --> 04:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's an answer
 
04:40:53.400 --> 04:40:57.050 align:start position:0%
it's an answer
okay

04:40:57.050 --> 04:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:59.570 --> 04:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:41:02.570 --> 04:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
just a quick question slash comment this
 
04:41:04.490 --> 04:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
seems to be this the hours seem to be
 
04:41:06.590 --> 04:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
arbitrary anyway it works in blocks of
 
04:41:09.050 --> 04:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
500. so a thousand fifteen hundred two
 
04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
thousand it doesn't really I mean there
 
04:41:12.050 --> 04:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
are bands of roving cosmetologists
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
causing problems do you know what I mean
 
04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
is everything a problem here this seems
 
04:41:17.150 --> 04:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
to be just some kind of bureaucratic
 
04:41:18.530 --> 04:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
thing that was put in back in the day
 
04:41:19.850 --> 04:41:19.860 align:start position:0%
somebody said a thousand somebody said
 
04:41:22.490 --> 04:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
I'll do better you're you're so anyway I
 
04:41:24.650 --> 04:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
got a question the question is thank you
 
04:41:26.288 --> 04:41:26.298 align:start position:0%
for your statement
 
04:41:29.750 --> 04:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
well if I could just address that I I
 
04:41:33.410 --> 04:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
agree and that's why many times part of
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
the reciprocity agreements we have
 
04:41:38.208 --> 04:41:38.218 align:start position:0%
require testing
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
um and and that is a way of leveling the
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh the expectation the minimum
 
04:41:45.890 --> 04:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
expectation we would have of these
 
04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
professionals but this isn't doesn't
 
04:41:50.330 --> 04:41:50.340 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with testing
 
04:41:50.340 --> 04:41:51.708 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with testing
okay

04:41:51.708 --> 04:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:41:55.250 --> 04:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
04:41:59.150 --> 04:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
04:42:10.010 --> 04:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:12.288 --> 04:42:12.298 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair it's great to be
 
04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
back in house Edna I always love being
 
04:42:17.990 --> 04:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
here a lot of new faces so
 
04:42:19.550 --> 04:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Ross
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
Connolly I'm the deputy state director
 
04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
for Americans for Prosperity here in New
 
04:42:25.970 --> 04:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh here to once again uh voice
 
04:42:28.490 --> 04:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
our support for uh this proposal this
 
04:42:31.430 --> 04:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
time as HB 409
 
04:42:31.440 --> 04:42:32.090 align:start position:0%
time as HB 409
um

04:42:32.090 --> 04:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:35.530 --> 04:42:35.540 align:start position:0%
as we've heard uh
 
04:42:38.628 --> 04:42:38.638 align:start position:0%
this really is just recognizing another
 
04:42:41.270 --> 04:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
State's licensure there's very little
 
04:42:44.030 --> 04:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
difference where most of this uh the
 
04:42:45.830 --> 04:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
folks that would come to New Hampshire
 
04:42:47.150 --> 04:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
specifically to have their license
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
transferred to come and work here they
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
would mostly come from New England
 
04:42:54.410 --> 04:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
states that's the the obvious thing uh
 
04:42:58.128 --> 04:42:58.138 align:start position:0%
so uh the differences between the New
 
04:42:59.930 --> 04:42:59.940 align:start position:0%
England states for for licensure for
 
04:43:03.230 --> 04:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
cosmetology uh both Massachusetts and
 
04:43:04.970 --> 04:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
Maine require a thousand hours to
 
04:43:07.128 --> 04:43:07.138 align:start position:0%
acquire a license Vermont Connecticut
 
04:43:08.810 --> 04:43:08.820 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island and New Hampshire all
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
require 1500 hours I'll require you to
 
04:43:15.650 --> 04:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
actually attend a school uh and all the
 
04:43:17.270 --> 04:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
other requirements that that New
 
04:43:20.530 --> 04:43:20.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh requires in in our license
 
04:43:23.770 --> 04:43:23.780 align:start position:0%
this simply is is making New Hampshire
 
04:43:27.050 --> 04:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
one it will free up Employers in the
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
state who you talk to any anyone who
 
04:43:31.550 --> 04:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
owns a barber shop a Cosmetology shop
 
04:43:33.830 --> 04:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's Super Cuts Great Clips or a
 
04:43:35.930 --> 04:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
locally owned shop it isn't incredibly
 
04:43:38.330 --> 04:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to find workers right
 
04:43:41.830 --> 04:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
now last year this this legislation
 
04:43:45.230 --> 04:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
easily passed the house I'm not sure why
 
04:43:48.050 --> 04:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
it didn't become law uh there was there
 
04:43:51.050 --> 04:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
was nobody opposed last year and in fact
 
04:43:53.628 --> 04:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
I believe Supercuts was in support of of
 
04:43:56.570 --> 04:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
the bill for that reason they are
 
04:44:00.410 --> 04:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
struggling to find workers uh and this
 
04:44:03.368 --> 04:44:03.378 align:start position:0%
is a a simple way to say we recognize
 
04:44:05.810 --> 04:44:05.820 align:start position:0%
licenses from out of state there's very
 
04:44:07.850 --> 04:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
little difference between those
 
04:44:10.368 --> 04:44:10.378 align:start position:0%
requirements which results in very very
 
04:44:12.590 --> 04:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
little risk to the consumer there's not
 
04:44:15.230 --> 04:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
a higher risk to the consumer when they
 
04:44:18.170 --> 04:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
get a haircut or have cosmetology
 
04:44:21.530 --> 04:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
services in Massachusetts compared to to
 
04:44:23.810 --> 04:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there's no increased risk
 
04:44:26.030 --> 04:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
based on that 500 hour difference in
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
training so uh
 
04:44:30.830 --> 04:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
you know this is a service that nearly
 
04:44:33.890 --> 04:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
everybody uh everybody uses it's a very
 
04:44:35.690 --> 04:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
very important service we want to make
 
04:44:38.390 --> 04:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
sure that these folks can can pursue
 
04:44:40.730 --> 04:44:40.740 align:start position:0%
their passions as easily as possible and
 
04:44:42.708 --> 04:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
as safely as possible and we believe
 
04:44:45.170 --> 04:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
that this bill achieves that for New
 
04:44:47.690 --> 04:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and will improve the the
 
04:44:50.270 --> 04:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
industry uh here in New Hampshire so for
 
04:44:52.730 --> 04:44:52.740 align:start position:0%
those reasons we urge the the committee
 
04:44:57.170 --> 04:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
to move ought to pass on HB 409
 
04:44:58.910 --> 04:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
04:45:01.128 --> 04:45:01.138 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:45:03.708 --> 04:45:03.718 align:start position:0%
uh representative leckis this time
 
04:45:05.810 --> 04:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um
 
04:45:08.810 --> 04:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
I noticed last year's Bill the Senate
 
04:45:10.250 --> 04:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
Senator interim study do you happen to
 
04:45:12.110 --> 04:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
know if they actually did study it and
 
04:45:15.288 --> 04:45:15.298 align:start position:0%
if so did they report anything on it uh
 
04:45:16.010 --> 04:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative I do not
 
04:45:21.470 --> 04:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
um often interim study is is a nice way
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
of uh killing a bell uh again I I am it
 
04:45:27.470 --> 04:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
was a real mystery why why it didn't
 
04:45:29.510 --> 04:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
pass uh there was very very little
 
04:45:31.910 --> 04:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
opposition uh this is something the
 
04:45:34.990 --> 04:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
industry was asking basically asking for
 
04:45:39.650 --> 04:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
uh in order to free up their uh their
 
04:45:43.990 --> 04:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
ability to hire workers okay thank you
 
04:45:47.150 --> 04:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh I'm generally
 
04:45:49.990 --> 04:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill but my question
 
04:45:54.530 --> 04:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
if if we if you know that uh it's back
 
04:45:56.390 --> 04:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
to the bill sponsors too if you know
 
04:45:58.610 --> 04:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
that it gets stuck in the Senate
 
04:46:00.410 --> 04:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
for some reason
 
04:46:03.948 --> 04:46:03.958 align:start position:0%
but I notice on your on the data sheet
 
04:46:07.070 --> 04:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
that you have no senatorial co-sponsors
 
04:46:09.530 --> 04:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
have you thought about maybe that would
 
04:46:11.390 --> 04:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
be a tactic that would help you get it
 
04:46:13.550 --> 04:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
through the Senate uh thank you for the
 
04:46:16.070 --> 04:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
question representative I I know uh
 
04:46:18.470 --> 04:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative power who who's a
 
04:46:19.670 --> 04:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
fantastic representative my
 
04:46:22.550 --> 04:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative Rose Marie rung uh both
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
worked really hard to to really get
 
04:46:26.990 --> 04:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
support for this bill uh both last year
 
04:46:28.850 --> 04:46:28.860 align:start position:0%
and this year
 
04:46:31.190 --> 04:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
um you know I think the Senate uh is the
 
04:46:32.990 --> 04:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
Senate they're they're busy with a lot
 
04:46:36.288 --> 04:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
of their work not sure why uh
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
folks then sign on but I can tell you
 
04:46:41.330 --> 04:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
that this this is a proposal that has
 
04:46:44.930 --> 04:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
broad support across both parties uh and
 
04:46:46.850 --> 04:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
again is something that that the
 
04:46:49.310 --> 04:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
industry really needs to attract uh
 
04:46:51.470 --> 04:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
workers here and and hopefully and
 
04:46:53.510 --> 04:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
improve the lives of the folks that are
 
04:46:55.368 --> 04:46:55.378 align:start position:0%
that are working in this industry good
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
luck with the Senate
 
04:47:00.708 --> 04:47:00.718 align:start position:0%
yes that's always always a factor anyone
 
04:47:00.718 --> 04:47:02.810 align:start position:0%
yes that's always always a factor anyone
else

04:47:02.810 --> 04:47:02.820 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:47:04.970 --> 04:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much Mr Connolly
 
04:47:06.770 --> 04:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:47:25.190 --> 04:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:27.230 --> 04:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
chair Maguire Vice chair Simon and all
 
04:47:28.368 --> 04:47:28.378 align:start position:0%
distinguished members of the House
 
04:47:29.810 --> 04:47:29.820 align:start position:0%
executive departments and administrative
 
04:47:31.610 --> 04:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for allowing me to
 
04:47:33.350 --> 04:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
testify on the regulation of beauty
 
04:47:34.970 --> 04:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
services and Professionals in New
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm the assistant director of
 
04:47:38.090 --> 04:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
the knee center for the study of
 
04:47:39.770 --> 04:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
Occupational regulation at West Virginia
 
04:47:39.780 --> 04:47:41.030 align:start position:0%
Occupational regulation at West Virginia
University

04:47:41.030 --> 04:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
University
 
04:47:43.010 --> 04:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
the main takeaways in my comments are
 
04:47:44.990 --> 04:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
the following one is that New Hampshire
 
04:47:47.270 --> 04:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
has a shortage of workers and should not
 
04:47:49.190 --> 04:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
create arbitrary barriers for potential
 
04:47:50.330 --> 04:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
new residents
 
04:47:52.730 --> 04:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
two the research shows that occupational
 
04:47:54.650 --> 04:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
licensing restricts Geographic Mobility
 
04:47:56.330 --> 04:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
by seven percent
 
04:47:57.948 --> 04:47:57.958 align:start position:0%
and three the recognition of
 
04:47:59.448 --> 04:47:59.458 align:start position:0%
out-of-state licenses is an excellent
 
04:48:01.550 --> 04:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
way to attract workers to the state
 
04:48:03.350 --> 04:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
now New Hampshire isn't a strong
 
04:48:05.330 --> 04:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
economic position and policy makers
 
04:48:06.410 --> 04:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
should be commended for setting the
 
04:48:07.850 --> 04:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
state up for prosperity
 
04:48:09.470 --> 04:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a relatively strong
 
04:48:11.090 --> 04:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
labor market compared to other states in
 
04:48:13.310 --> 04:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
the country in November 2020 the
 
04:48:14.750 --> 04:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate was below the national
 
04:48:16.190 --> 04:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
average in the state
 
04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
and the labor force participation rate
 
04:48:19.670 --> 04:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
was above the national average
 
04:48:21.410 --> 04:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Employers in New Hampshire
 
04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
are having a difficult time finding
 
04:48:24.590 --> 04:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
employers to fill the current job
 
04:48:24.600 --> 04:48:25.670 align:start position:0%
employers to fill the current job
openings

04:48:25.670 --> 04:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
openings
 
04:48:27.288 --> 04:48:27.298 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of the most severe
 
04:48:29.990 --> 04:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
worker shortages in the nation with 49
 
04:48:31.910 --> 04:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
available workers for every 100 job
 
04:48:33.470 --> 04:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
openings in the state
 
04:48:35.570 --> 04:48:35.580 align:start position:0%
so the inability of businesses to fill
 
04:48:36.890 --> 04:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
these openings is holding back New
 
04:48:36.900 --> 04:48:38.270 align:start position:0%
these openings is holding back New
Hampshire

04:48:38.270 --> 04:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:48:40.430 --> 04:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
we estimate that 16 percent of workers
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire require a license to
 
04:48:44.270 --> 04:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
work now licensing is the most stringent
 
04:48:46.190 --> 04:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
form of Professional Regulation
 
04:48:48.410 --> 04:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
although they're passed to um and
 
04:48:49.970 --> 04:48:49.980 align:start position:0%
designed to improve the quality of
 
04:48:51.830 --> 04:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
services that consumers receive
 
04:48:53.750 --> 04:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
they also forbid professionals from
 
04:48:55.128 --> 04:48:55.138 align:start position:0%
working until they meet licensing
 
04:48:56.690 --> 04:48:56.700 align:start position:0%
requirements so that means education
 
04:48:58.910 --> 04:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
Hands-On training and passing exams
 
04:49:00.948 --> 04:49:00.958 align:start position:0%
which can create barriers to entry into
 
04:49:02.030 --> 04:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
a profession
 
04:49:04.128 --> 04:49:04.138 align:start position:0%
and research estimates that these
 
04:49:06.050 --> 04:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
barriers entry reduce the supply
 
04:49:08.990 --> 04:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
professionals by up to 27 percent
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
importantly for this piece of
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislation is that licensing also
 
04:49:13.788 --> 04:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
creates a barrier to entry for those
 
04:49:15.230 --> 04:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
looking to move from one state to
 
04:49:15.240 --> 04:49:16.070 align:start position:0%
looking to move from one state to
another

04:49:16.070 --> 04:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
another
 
04:49:17.868 --> 04:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
because Licensing Laws are passed by
 
04:49:20.030 --> 04:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
state legislatures moving to a new state
 
04:49:21.830 --> 04:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
often entails reapplying for licensure
 
04:49:24.050 --> 04:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
taking exams and sometimes even going
 
04:49:27.410 --> 04:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:30.530 --> 04:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
moving is already an expensive process
 
04:49:32.208 --> 04:49:32.218 align:start position:0%
and this added cost can dissuade
 
04:49:34.190 --> 04:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
professionals from moving entirely
 
04:49:35.868 --> 04:49:35.878 align:start position:0%
we estimate the Licensing Laws reduce
 
04:49:37.850 --> 04:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
Geographic Mobility by seven percent so
 
04:49:40.670 --> 04:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
it does have a significant effect
 
04:49:42.288 --> 04:49:42.298 align:start position:0%
now it doesn't only impact licensed
 
04:49:44.150 --> 04:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
professionals and two income households
 
04:49:45.890 --> 04:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
a professional who doesn't require a
 
04:49:48.170 --> 04:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
license still May forego moving if their
 
04:49:49.250 --> 04:49:49.260 align:start position:0%
spouse needs to go through a long
 
04:49:51.110 --> 04:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
re-licensing process
 
04:49:52.850 --> 04:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
now New Hampshire won't be going on a
 
04:49:54.650 --> 04:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
limb if it unconditionally recognizes
 
04:49:56.510 --> 04:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
Barber and cosmetology and aesthetic
 
04:49:58.128 --> 04:49:58.138 align:start position:0%
licenses from other states
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
currently 17 other states
 
04:50:03.890 --> 04:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
allow all professional
 
04:50:05.628 --> 04:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
um regardless of the education level
 
04:50:08.090 --> 04:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
whether it's specifically for Barber's
 
04:50:11.090 --> 04:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists and estheticians or if
 
04:50:13.250 --> 04:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
it's a universal recognition law that
 
04:50:16.070 --> 04:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
allows all professionals to be able to
 
04:50:18.590 --> 04:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
do that there are six other states that
 
04:50:20.448 --> 04:50:20.458 align:start position:0%
require some amount of experience
 
04:50:22.010 --> 04:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
typically one to two years of experience
 
04:50:23.570 --> 04:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
of practice and then regardless of the
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
education level they'll accept the
 
04:50:25.440 --> 04:50:27.288 align:start position:0%
education level they'll accept the
license

04:50:27.288 --> 04:50:27.298 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:50:29.090 --> 04:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
again Six States have gone even further
 
04:50:30.708 --> 04:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
and they accept licenses for all
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
licensed professionals so Arizona was
 
04:50:34.070 --> 04:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
the first state to recognize
 
04:50:36.830 --> 04:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
out-of-state licenses in 2019 and
 
04:50:38.530 --> 04:50:38.540 align:start position:0%
they've already seen beneficial effects
 
04:50:41.330 --> 04:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
estimated 6 000 more licensed
 
04:50:43.070 --> 04:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
professionals moved in the state since
 
04:50:45.708 --> 04:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
the passage of the reform
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
I can briefly touch on how New
 
04:50:50.208 --> 04:50:50.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's education requirements
 
04:50:54.050 --> 04:50:54.060 align:start position:0%
compare for Barbers I found four states
 
04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
that have lower education requirements
 
04:50:58.010 --> 04:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
than New Hampshire for cosmetologists I
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
found 10 states and 10 states as well
 
04:51:02.448 --> 04:51:02.458 align:start position:0%
for estheticians
 
04:51:04.368 --> 04:51:04.378 align:start position:0%
now given the difficulties of finding
 
04:51:05.930 --> 04:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
available workers faced by New Hampshire
 
04:51:08.750 --> 04:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
businesses forcing residents to complete
 
04:51:10.850 --> 04:51:10.860 align:start position:0%
arbitrary hurdles to begin working as
 
04:51:13.128 --> 04:51:13.138 align:start position:0%
especially costly allowing licensed
 
04:51:14.510 --> 04:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
professionals to bring their licenses
 
04:51:16.490 --> 04:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
with them increases worker Mobility
 
04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
while still leaving those Consumer
 
04:51:19.850 --> 04:51:19.860 align:start position:0%
Protections in place
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
this is no Silver Bullet to help
 
04:51:23.990 --> 04:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
alleviate the hiring difficulties but
 
04:51:25.430 --> 04:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's a common sense reform that can help
 
04:51:27.410 --> 04:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
those looking to move to New Hampshire
 
04:51:28.970 --> 04:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
with that I'd like to thank you for your
 
04:51:30.170 --> 04:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
time and I'll be more than happy to
 
04:51:33.050 --> 04:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you have
 
04:51:35.208 --> 04:51:35.218 align:start position:0%
to representative
 
04:51:38.150 --> 04:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
What other state has similar legislation
 
04:51:41.390 --> 04:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
the ones that being proposed today
 
04:51:44.208 --> 04:51:44.218 align:start position:0%
um I have a list here so Alabama
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
California Colorado Connecticut Delaware
 
04:51:49.610 --> 04:51:49.620 align:start position:0%

Washington
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I just need a number I don't
 
04:52:02.750 --> 04:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
know oh I'm sorry I said how many 17
 
04:52:04.730 --> 04:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
um either specifically Barbara's
 
04:52:06.830 --> 04:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists and estheticians or all
 
04:52:10.850 --> 04:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:13.128 --> 04:52:13.138 align:start position:0%
and there's six more that require one to
 
04:52:15.890 --> 04:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
two years of working experience
 
04:52:20.350 --> 04:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:22.070 --> 04:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you

okay thank you very much do you have
 
04:52:44.270 --> 04:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
written testimony

um I do yes thank you that'll be very
 
04:52:46.740 --> 04:52:52.850 align:start position:0%
um I do yes thank you that'll be very
helpful

04:52:52.850 --> 04:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:04.310 --> 04:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:06.050 --> 04:53:06.060 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman and members
 
04:53:07.368 --> 04:53:07.378 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh for the record I'm
 
04:53:09.590 --> 04:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
Andrew Klein president of the Josiah
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
Bartlett Center for Public Policy we are
 
04:53:13.550 --> 04:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's free market Think Tank
 
04:53:16.368 --> 04:53:16.378 align:start position:0%
and uh we are a 501c3 educational
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
organization so we do not take positions
 
04:53:20.990 --> 04:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
on bills we are here to give our opinion
 
04:53:23.510 --> 04:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
what the effects of such bills might be
 
04:53:25.128 --> 04:53:25.138 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:53:26.570 --> 04:53:26.580 align:start position:0%
I have some written testimony I can
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
leave for you uh so let me just start
 
04:53:29.280 --> 04:53:30.050 align:start position:0%
leave for you uh so let me just start
with

04:53:30.050 --> 04:53:30.060 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:53:31.730 --> 04:53:31.740 align:start position:0%
the fact that occupational licensing
 
04:53:33.410 --> 04:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
might not seem like an area that has
 
04:53:35.570 --> 04:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
received a lot of you know scrutiny from
 
04:53:37.250 --> 04:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
economists but in fact it has for
 
04:53:39.530 --> 04:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
multiple decades it is a heavily
 
04:53:42.788 --> 04:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
researched uh field of economic
 
04:53:46.368 --> 04:53:46.378 align:start position:0%
activity and the overwhelming consensus
 
04:53:48.830 --> 04:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
from a great deal of academic research
 
04:53:50.090 --> 04:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
in this area
 
04:53:53.090 --> 04:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
is that uh occupational licenses tend to
 
04:53:54.890 --> 04:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
increase costs for consumers while
 
04:53:57.190 --> 04:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
offering little and in some cases no
 
04:53:59.810 --> 04:53:59.820 align:start position:0%
health or safety benefit
 
04:54:02.868 --> 04:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
uh just as an example in 1990 the
 
04:54:04.550 --> 04:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
Federal Trade Commission conducted a
 
04:54:06.410 --> 04:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
review of Occupational Licensing in the
 
04:54:08.868 --> 04:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
United States and concluded that quote
 
04:54:11.750 --> 04:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
studies reviewed and evaluated by this
 
04:54:13.970 --> 04:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
report indicate that licensing one may
 
04:54:16.788 --> 04:54:16.798 align:start position:0%
not increase quality two has imposed
 
04:54:19.550 --> 04:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
large costs on consumers and three may
 
04:54:22.010 --> 04:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
be ineffective in lessening potential
 
04:54:24.590 --> 04:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
overprescription of treatment problems
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
therefore the use of Licensing should be
 
04:54:30.530 --> 04:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
limited to case Excuse Me cases in which
 
04:54:33.948 --> 04:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
other less restrictive alternatives
 
04:54:36.410 --> 04:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
are ineffective or more costly to
 
04:54:38.030 --> 04:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
administer so in other words the Federal
 
04:54:39.650 --> 04:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
Trade Commission says don't license
 
04:54:41.990 --> 04:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
unless you absolutely have to and
 
04:54:44.930 --> 04:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
there's no other less costly alternative
 
04:54:47.510 --> 04:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
Stephen slavinski is one of the experts
 
04:54:50.030 --> 04:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
who's studied this at the academic level
 
04:54:51.770 --> 04:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
he's a researcher at Arizona State
 
04:54:53.750 --> 04:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
University and he's specifically studied
 
04:54:55.970 --> 04:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
licensed portability
 
04:54:58.970 --> 04:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
and uh his conclusion is uh
 
04:55:01.788 --> 04:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
that the general quote lack of license
 
04:55:04.550 --> 04:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
portability has real world impacts it
 
04:55:06.230 --> 04:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
keeps workers from moving to a state
 
04:55:08.510 --> 04:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
when they might otherwise lack of
 
04:55:10.850 --> 04:55:10.860 align:start position:0%
portability is also especially onerous
 
04:55:13.250 --> 04:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
for trailing spouses of military members
 
04:55:15.530 --> 04:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
who are often kept out of the workforce
 
04:55:17.208 --> 04:55:17.218 align:start position:0%
when their family is transferred to a
 
04:55:18.350 --> 04:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
new state
 
04:55:21.050 --> 04:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
still quoting Professor slavinsky
 
04:55:23.390 --> 04:55:23.400 align:start position:0%
getting a new license requires costly
 
04:55:25.550 --> 04:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
time consuming and duplicative hours of
 
04:55:27.470 --> 04:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
training just to do the job that the
 
04:55:29.090 --> 04:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
worker was already doing before they
 
04:55:31.010 --> 04:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
moved across the state border
 
04:55:32.690 --> 04:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
as a result the lack of Occupational
 
04:55:35.690 --> 04:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
licensing portability suppresses labor
 
04:55:37.550 --> 04:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
market opportunities for new residents
 
04:55:39.350 --> 04:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
of a state additionally it has the
 
04:55:41.448 --> 04:55:41.458 align:start position:0%
effect of discouraging people from
 
04:55:43.970 --> 04:55:43.980 align:start position:0%
moving to a new state at all now this is
 
04:55:46.250 --> 04:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
a serious issue for New Hampshire which
 
04:55:48.830 --> 04:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
is suffering from a years-long acute
 
04:55:50.090 --> 04:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
labor shortage
 
04:55:52.610 --> 04:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
last year New Hampshire was ranked the
 
04:55:54.230 --> 04:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
third hardest state in the nation to
 
04:55:56.868 --> 04:55:56.878 align:start position:0%

04:56:02.030 --> 04:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
puts our total number of job openings in

licensed occupation is covered in this
 
04:56:08.878 --> 04:56:09.770 align:start position:0%
licensed occupation is covered in this
bill

04:56:09.770 --> 04:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
the state has the State Employment
 
04:56:14.090 --> 04:56:14.100 align:start position:0%

04:56:15.230 --> 04:56:15.240 align:start position:0%

04:56:17.628 --> 04:56:17.638 align:start position:0%
classification for hairdressers hair
 
04:56:19.730 --> 04:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
stylists and cosmetologists they're all
 
04:56:22.670 --> 04:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
lumped into one classification in 2021
 
04:56:24.350 --> 04:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
which is the last year the state has
 
04:56:27.410 --> 04:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
released a report of this data
 
04:56:29.810 --> 04:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
the total number of hairdressers hair
 
04:56:31.610 --> 04:56:31.620 align:start position:0%
stylists and cosmetologists in New
 
04:56:34.788 --> 04:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was 1860.
 
04:56:39.830 --> 04:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
in 2017 the number was 2020.
 
04:56:43.270 --> 04:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
so in four years we lost about 160
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
positions in this field while our
 
04:56:49.010 --> 04:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
population continued to increase
 
04:56:51.288 --> 04:56:51.298 align:start position:0%
we have a shortage
 
04:56:52.490 --> 04:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
you might have experienced some
 
04:56:53.690 --> 04:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
difficulty scheduling an appointment
 
04:56:56.330 --> 04:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
with your Barber or hair stylist in the
 
04:56:57.890 --> 04:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
last few years because of this labor
 
04:56:57.900 --> 04:56:58.788 align:start position:0%
last few years because of this labor
shortage

04:56:58.788 --> 04:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
shortage
 
04:57:01.070 --> 04:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 409 would help to fill that
 
04:57:02.990 --> 04:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
shortage by making it easier on the
 
04:57:05.150 --> 04:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
margins for licensed Professionals in
 
04:57:06.470 --> 04:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
these fields to move to New Hampshire
 
04:57:11.628 --> 04:57:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:13.368 --> 04:57:13.378 align:start position:0%
it would address this labor source and
 
04:57:15.770 --> 04:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
portability Problem by removing from
 
04:57:18.230 --> 04:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
state law the entirely unnecessary
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
Clause that grants Barber cosmetology
 
04:57:23.530 --> 04:57:23.540 align:start position:0%
and Aesthetics license
 
04:57:26.030 --> 04:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
reciprocity only when the practitioner's
 
04:57:27.490 --> 04:57:27.500 align:start position:0%
home state
 
04:57:29.810 --> 04:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
requirements are quote substantially
 
04:57:32.330 --> 04:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
equivalent to or higher than New
 
04:57:32.340 --> 04:57:34.190 align:start position:0%
equivalent to or higher than New
Hampshire's

04:57:34.190 --> 04:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's
 
04:57:36.708 --> 04:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
seemingly harmless claws but it's got
 
04:57:38.868 --> 04:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
problems first it's vague what does it
 
04:57:38.878 --> 04:57:39.890 align:start position:0%
problems first it's vague what does it
mean

04:57:39.890 --> 04:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
mean
 
04:57:41.690 --> 04:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt we you were just
 
04:57:43.070 --> 04:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
going back and forth with some witnesses
 
04:57:45.288 --> 04:57:45.298 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
04:57:47.270 --> 04:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
how do you measure whether it's
 
04:57:48.770 --> 04:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
substantially similar
 
04:57:50.930 --> 04:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
well one of the ways we measure that is
 
04:57:54.770 --> 04:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
ours but some states require hours and
 
04:57:57.650 --> 04:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
experience some states require hours or
 
04:57:57.660 --> 04:57:59.510 align:start position:0%
experience some states require hours or
experience

04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:58:02.690 --> 04:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
some states have one test to pass after
 
04:58:06.110 --> 04:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
your hours some states have three tests
 
04:58:09.230 --> 04:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
to pass some states have no test to pass
 
04:58:11.208 --> 04:58:11.218 align:start position:0%
this is so vague that it's really
 
04:58:13.368 --> 04:58:13.378 align:start position:0%
actually difficult to decide what
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent to means
 
04:58:19.490 --> 04:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
so we generally use hours as a proxy
 
04:58:21.470 --> 04:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
for barbering New Hampshire has among
 
04:58:22.850 --> 04:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
the lowest hours of education
 
04:58:24.350 --> 04:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
requirements in the nation we require
 
04:58:26.448 --> 04:58:26.458 align:start position:0%
800 hours of training
 
04:58:28.490 --> 04:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
to become a barber only four states
 
04:58:31.490 --> 04:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
require fewer hours than New Hampshire
 
04:58:33.830 --> 04:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
one of them is New York
 
04:58:36.050 --> 04:58:36.060 align:start position:0%
New York requires and we have an expert
 
04:58:37.850 --> 04:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
here behind me who will correct me if I
 
04:58:39.830 --> 04:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
get this number wrong the latest info I
 
04:58:43.128 --> 04:58:43.138 align:start position:0%
have is a 291 clock hours of training to
 
04:58:45.470 --> 04:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
be a barber in New York
 
04:58:47.090 --> 04:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
now they have some other requirements in
 
04:58:48.050 --> 04:58:48.060 align:start position:0%
there but if we're going by hours
 
04:58:51.170 --> 04:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
there's a lower buy a lot
 
04:58:53.150 --> 04:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
one could easily argue that this
 
04:58:55.368 --> 04:58:55.378 align:start position:0%
requirement is not substantially similar
 
04:58:58.730 --> 04:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire's 800 hours versus 291
 
04:58:58.740 --> 04:59:00.288 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire's 800 hours versus 291
hours

04:59:00.288 --> 04:59:00.298 align:start position:0%
hours
 
04:59:02.628 --> 04:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
but does anyone actually believe that
 
04:59:05.030 --> 04:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
Manhattan Barbers oppose a danger to New
 
04:59:05.040 --> 04:59:06.350 align:start position:0%
Manhattan Barbers oppose a danger to New
Yorkers

04:59:06.350 --> 04:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
Yorkers
 
04:59:08.390 --> 04:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
or that a licensed Barber who moves to
 
04:59:10.670 --> 04:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
New York from New Hampshire or from New
 
04:59:12.410 --> 04:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
York to New Hampshire is a danger to
 
04:59:13.730 --> 04:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters
 
04:59:15.470 --> 04:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
if you're qualified to cut Sarah
 
04:59:18.110 --> 04:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
jakasuka Parker's hair I think you're
 
04:59:20.990 --> 04:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
qualified to cut Maggie Hassan's hair
 
04:59:23.990 --> 04:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
Vermont Florida and Oregon also mandate
 
04:59:26.090 --> 04:59:26.100 align:start position:0%
fewer hours of arbitrating than New
 
04:59:26.100 --> 04:59:27.170 align:start position:0%
fewer hours of arbitrating than New
Hampshire

04:59:27.170 --> 04:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:59:29.150 --> 04:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
for cosmetology
 
04:59:31.070 --> 04:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire requires 1500 hours in
 
04:59:33.770 --> 04:59:33.780 align:start position:0%
training eight states by my count
 
04:59:35.628 --> 04:59:35.638 align:start position:0%
maybe more than that
 
04:59:37.970 --> 04:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
um by a few but my last count was eight
 
04:59:40.190 --> 04:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
states require fewer hours and that
 
04:59:42.650 --> 04:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
includes Massachusetts and Vermont which
 
04:59:44.628 --> 04:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
both require only a thousand hours of
 
04:59:44.638 --> 04:59:45.830 align:start position:0%
both require only a thousand hours of
training

04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
training
 
04:59:47.390 --> 04:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody here would argue
 
04:59:47.400 --> 04:59:48.430 align:start position:0%
I don't think anybody here would argue
that

04:59:48.430 --> 04:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:59:50.930 --> 04:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists in Boston are a danger to
 
04:59:50.940 --> 04:59:52.730 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists in Boston are a danger to
bostonians

04:59:52.730 --> 04:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
bostonians
 
04:59:54.830 --> 04:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
California New York New Jersey and
 
04:59:56.868 --> 04:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
Florida also require fewer hours of
 
04:59:58.250 --> 04:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
training for cosmetology than New
 
04:59:59.390 --> 04:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does
 
05:00:01.128 --> 05:00:01.138 align:start position:0%
again it would be absurd to argue that
 
05:00:02.810 --> 05:00:02.820 align:start position:0%
cosmetologists in these states are a
 
05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
danger or they should be forbidden from
 
05:00:06.770 --> 05:00:06.780 align:start position:0%
working in New Hampshire without first
 
05:00:10.550 --> 05:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
passing the New Hampshire licensing exam
 
05:00:12.850 --> 05:00:12.860 align:start position:0%
so that gives you sort of the landscape
 
05:00:15.170 --> 05:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions but I
 
05:00:16.788 --> 05:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
think this bill by removing that vague
 
05:00:19.490 --> 05:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
provision would not pose any health or
 
05:00:21.250 --> 05:00:21.260 align:start position:0%
safety risk to anyone in New Hampshire
 
05:00:23.868 --> 05:00:23.878 align:start position:0%
and it would not be a race to the bottom
 
05:00:25.550 --> 05:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
because when you look at the actual hour
 
05:00:29.030 --> 05:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
requirements New Hampshire is towards
 
05:00:31.730 --> 05:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
the bottom for all of these fields we do
 
05:00:33.590 --> 05:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
not require the most hours of training
 
05:00:36.110 --> 05:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
Most states require as many hours or
 
05:00:38.030 --> 05:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
more than New Hampshire for all of these
 
05:00:39.590 --> 05:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
licenses so New Hampshire is already
 
05:00:41.628 --> 05:00:41.638 align:start position:0%
kind of near the bottom so it's not like
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
we're all of a sudden going to collapse
 
05:00:45.708 --> 05:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
to some low level of training or or
 
05:00:49.070 --> 05:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
accept you know when we were testifying
 
05:00:50.690 --> 05:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
on this bill a couple of Cycles ago
 
05:00:53.628 --> 05:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
there were worries that maybe you know
 
05:00:56.990 --> 05:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
Alabama or Arkansas or some State like
 
05:00:58.250 --> 05:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
that would have
 
05:01:00.110 --> 05:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
um you know no training or but in fact
 
05:01:02.510 --> 05:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of Northeastern states and
 
05:01:03.890 --> 05:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
western states that have lower hours
 
05:01:05.150 --> 05:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
than New Hampshire a lot of the Southern
 
05:01:06.890 --> 05:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
States in fact I think almost all the
 
05:01:08.208 --> 05:01:08.218 align:start position:0%
southern states have higher hours of
 
05:01:09.708 --> 05:01:09.718 align:start position:0%
training so
 
05:01:09.718 --> 05:01:10.910 align:start position:0%
training so
anyway

05:01:10.910 --> 05:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
05:01:12.410 --> 05:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
that gives you a sense where we are and
 
05:01:19.490 --> 05:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:21.110 --> 05:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:01:23.330 --> 05:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
um I'm sympathetic to this bill I voted
 
05:01:25.190 --> 05:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
for it the last time around
 
05:01:26.510 --> 05:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
um so I don't want my questions to be
 
05:01:28.368 --> 05:01:28.378 align:start position:0%
misconstrued but I'm curious about is I
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
feel like there are two elements of this
 
05:01:31.310 --> 05:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
bill that are going on at the same time
 
05:01:33.830 --> 05:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
there is the concern potentially that
 
05:01:35.390 --> 05:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
this is a race to a bottom right it's
 
05:01:36.650 --> 05:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
the race to the lowest common
 
05:01:38.750 --> 05:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
denominator we're going to accept the
 
05:01:41.390 --> 05:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
lowest standard available and that that
 
05:01:44.090 --> 05:01:44.100 align:start position:0%
will increase risk to the
 
05:01:45.288 --> 05:01:45.298 align:start position:0%
um citizens of the State of New
 
05:01:45.298 --> 05:01:46.550 align:start position:0%
um citizens of the State of New
Hampshire

05:01:46.550 --> 05:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:01:48.170 --> 05:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
um by nature of it being the lowest
 
05:01:50.150 --> 05:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
common denominator there's that side of
 
05:01:52.670 --> 05:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
it or there's we're requiring too much
 
05:01:54.470 --> 05:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
training in our state more training
 
05:01:56.628 --> 05:01:56.638 align:start position:0%
that's necessary and should we also be
 
05:01:58.970 --> 05:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
looking at lowing our regulations to
 
05:02:00.708 --> 05:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
meet the surrounding states because from
 
05:02:01.788 --> 05:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
testimony one of the things that I'm
 
05:02:03.530 --> 05:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
concerned about is it seems like two
 
05:02:05.770 --> 05:02:05.780 align:start position:0%
states that are directly abutting us
 
05:02:08.570 --> 05:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
have lower standards than we do and once
 
05:02:10.250 --> 05:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
again it's not just the ability to
 
05:02:11.510 --> 05:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
practice in the state that I'm concerned
 
05:02:14.810 --> 05:02:14.820 align:start position:0%
about but also receiving your licensure
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
um and so my question is
 
05:02:19.490 --> 05:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh from your testimony it sounds like
 
05:02:22.128 --> 05:02:22.138 align:start position:0%
you would say that maybe we're our bars
 
05:02:24.410 --> 05:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
a little too high I I think that's a
 
05:02:25.970 --> 05:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
fair assessment just based on what we've
 
05:02:27.288 --> 05:02:27.298 align:start position:0%
looked at with training requirements
 
05:02:28.670 --> 05:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
around the country
 
05:02:30.830 --> 05:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
um again New Hampshire's bar is actually
 
05:02:33.530 --> 05:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
relatively speaking low there are a lot
 
05:02:36.590 --> 05:02:36.600 align:start position:0%
of states that have higher bars but
 
05:02:38.330 --> 05:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
for the Northeast and for our neighbors
 
05:02:40.570 --> 05:02:40.580 align:start position:0%
we're actually fairly High
 
05:02:42.470 --> 05:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily high in some of these
 
05:02:44.030 --> 05:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
respects I would say so I think you
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
could certainly make the argument that
 
05:02:46.570 --> 05:02:46.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:02:49.490 --> 05:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
for cosmetology in particular were 50
 
05:02:53.390 --> 05:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
higher than our neighbors I have not yet
 
05:02:55.128 --> 05:02:55.138 align:start position:0%
encountered despite quite a bit of
 
05:02:56.930 --> 05:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
research on this issue a really good
 
05:02:58.610 --> 05:02:58.620 align:start position:0%
reason for that
 
05:02:58.620 --> 05:02:59.390 align:start position:0%
reason for that
um

05:02:59.390 --> 05:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:02.208 --> 05:03:02.218 align:start position:0%
but if you really want to get a um an
 
05:03:04.788 --> 05:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
hours-long meeting then propose a bill
 
05:03:07.628 --> 05:03:07.638 align:start position:0%
to cut those hours and you will see
 
05:03:10.250 --> 05:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
you'll have a long long meeting ahead of
 
05:03:10.260 --> 05:03:11.770 align:start position:0%
you'll have a long long meeting ahead of
you

05:03:11.770 --> 05:03:11.780 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:03:14.448 --> 05:03:14.458 align:start position:0%
answer questions yeah I'd like to
 
05:03:16.490 --> 05:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
mention that I know someone
 
05:03:20.570 --> 05:03:20.580 align:start position:0%
who 40 plus years ago was living in
 
05:03:22.670 --> 05:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts intending to move to New
 
05:03:25.490 --> 05:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and while she was at school
 
05:03:28.128 --> 05:03:28.138 align:start position:0%
got the additional hours because even
 
05:03:28.138 --> 05:03:29.150 align:start position:0%
got the additional hours because even
then

05:03:29.150 --> 05:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:03:31.788 --> 05:03:31.798 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts required fewer hours in
 
05:03:32.690 --> 05:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:03:32.700 --> 05:03:33.890 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
yeah

05:03:33.890 --> 05:03:33.900 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:03:36.770 --> 05:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
and it's not the the customers in New
 
05:03:38.390 --> 05:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are more demanding than the
 
05:03:41.390 --> 05:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
customers in Massachusetts right
 
05:03:44.570 --> 05:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions come up thank
 
05:03:46.490 --> 05:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr Klein
 
05:04:06.230 --> 05:04:06.240 align:start position:0%

requires out-of-state Beauty license

license requirements to be substantially
 
05:05:24.410 --> 05:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
equivalent to or higher than those of
 
05:05:26.750 --> 05:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
New York's or New New Hampshire's
 
05:05:28.670 --> 05:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
license my apologies
 
05:05:30.830 --> 05:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
and to answer a question that was
 
05:05:34.250 --> 05:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
proposed earlier the language related to
 
05:05:36.288 --> 05:05:36.298 align:start position:0%
substantial equivalent to or higher than
 
05:05:39.770 --> 05:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
the intention of that is to um is to
 
05:05:42.650 --> 05:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
mean hours not to uh not to determine
 
05:05:44.628 --> 05:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
other things like curriculum
 
05:05:46.550 --> 05:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
um and and um
 
05:05:50.030 --> 05:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
uh practitioner uh practitioner hours
 
05:05:51.770 --> 05:05:51.780 align:start position:0%
outside of school
 
05:05:53.690 --> 05:05:53.700 align:start position:0%
that arbitrary requirement restricts the
 
05:05:55.310 --> 05:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
mobility of licenses which is a problem
 
05:05:56.990 --> 05:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
for beauty professionals and employers
 
05:05:59.330 --> 05:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
Employers in the state I encourage this
 
05:06:00.948 --> 05:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
committee to support House Bill 409
 
05:06:02.510 --> 05:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
because reducing licensing barriers
 
05:06:04.310 --> 05:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
creates more opportunities for citizens
 
05:06:05.868 --> 05:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
05:06:08.090 --> 05:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
first licensing Mobility is exceedingly
 
05:06:09.890 --> 05:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
important employers across the country
 
05:06:12.170 --> 05:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
are experiencing labor shortages making
 
05:06:13.368 --> 05:06:13.378 align:start position:0%
it easier for licensed Beauty
 
05:06:14.868 --> 05:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
professionals to work by reducing
 
05:06:16.490 --> 05:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
barriers will allow employers to have a
 
05:06:18.590 --> 05:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
wider pool of potential applicants
 
05:06:20.930 --> 05:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
second the substantial equivalent or
 
05:06:22.910 --> 05:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
higher than language or requirement is
 
05:06:25.190 --> 05:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
vague it creates a chilling effect for a
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
potential Beauty professionals who may
 
05:06:27.770 --> 05:06:27.780 align:start position:0%

qualified Beauty professionals may

choose not to bring their skills here
 
05:06:33.350 --> 05:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
for fear of having to undergo additional
 
05:06:35.690 --> 05:06:35.700 align:start position:0%
costly and time-consuming training
 
05:06:37.430 --> 05:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
third this bill helps to empower women
 
05:06:39.470 --> 05:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
most Beauty service professionals are
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
women and Beauty service skills are
 
05:06:43.850 --> 05:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
easily transferable making this an
 
05:06:45.110 --> 05:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
industry that is attractive for women
 
05:06:46.490 --> 05:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
who want to continue to support their
 
05:06:47.750 --> 05:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
families while moving from state to
 
05:06:49.788 --> 05:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
state however the time it takes to

05:06:53.628 --> 05:06:53.638 align:start position:0%
license for these professionals means
 
05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
that these women are out of work because
 
05:06:57.230 --> 05:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
of needless bureaucracy which leaves
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
their careers to stagnate
 
05:07:00.650 --> 05:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
this bill helps to get these women into
 
05:07:02.270 --> 05:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
work sooner to support their families
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
and to continue to advocate for their
 
05:07:06.830 --> 05:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
careers House Bill 409 makes a small
 
05:07:08.270 --> 05:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
change to the law that will have large
 
05:07:10.910 --> 05:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
impacts for beauty professionals
 
05:07:12.770 --> 05:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
in conclusion I encourage this committee
 
05:07:14.208 --> 05:07:14.218 align:start position:0%
to support House Bill 409 so that
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
skilled Beauty professionals can bring
 
05:07:17.570 --> 05:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
their skills to New Hampshire thank you
 
05:07:19.970 --> 05:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to testify and I am
 
05:07:21.170 --> 05:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
 
05:07:22.730 --> 05:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
only have
 
05:07:28.368 --> 05:07:28.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:28.378 --> 05:07:30.050 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:07:30.050 --> 05:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:07:34.490 --> 05:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
all right I don't see any and thank you
 
05:07:38.208 --> 05:07:38.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:39.948 --> 05:07:39.958 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 409
 
05:07:50.030 --> 05:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:51.288 --> 05:07:51.298 align:start position:0%
thank you again
 
05:07:52.490 --> 05:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
um for the record Lindsay Courtney
 
05:07:55.430 --> 05:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
executive director oplc uh the agency is
 
05:07:56.990 --> 05:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
not taking a position on this bill we
 
05:07:59.150 --> 05:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
generally support portability
 
05:08:00.770 --> 05:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
um I think that there is an opportunity
 
05:08:02.208 --> 05:08:02.218 align:start position:0%
to look at the hours requirements
 
05:08:04.610 --> 05:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
however I think there is an unintended
 
05:08:06.470 --> 05:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
consequence as a result of the Bill's
 
05:08:08.530 --> 05:08:08.540 align:start position:0%
Language by striking the language
 
05:08:10.550 --> 05:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
substantially equivalent to or higher
 
05:08:12.128 --> 05:08:12.138 align:start position:0%
than those of the other state
 
05:08:15.350 --> 05:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
the language currently requires that the
 
05:08:17.270 --> 05:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
applicant hold a quote current and valid
 
05:08:19.730 --> 05:08:19.740 align:start position:0%
license a current invalid license
 
05:08:22.448 --> 05:08:22.458 align:start position:0%
includes licenses that are suspended
 
05:08:25.070 --> 05:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
suspended licenses are both current and
 
05:08:26.930 --> 05:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
they're both valid individuals with
 
05:08:28.970 --> 05:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
suspended licenses on the basis of
 
05:08:30.530 --> 05:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
discipline have to renew their license
 
05:08:32.750 --> 05:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise they lapse or they expire and
 
05:08:34.430 --> 05:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
they have to meet other requirements to
 
05:08:36.708 --> 05:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
reinstate so
 
05:08:39.730 --> 05:08:39.740 align:start position:0%
um because right now the statute
 
05:08:42.110 --> 05:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
includes the substantially equivalent to
 
05:08:43.490 --> 05:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
or higher than those in the other state
 
05:08:43.500 --> 05:08:44.708 align:start position:0%
or higher than those in the other state
language

05:08:44.708 --> 05:08:44.718 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:08:47.390 --> 05:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
the board is in a position to be able to
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
deny licensure if for example the
 
05:08:51.530 --> 05:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
individual has a license that's
 
05:08:53.990 --> 05:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
suspended in another state if that
 
05:08:56.410 --> 05:08:56.420 align:start position:0%
language were stricken
 
05:08:58.430 --> 05:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that the language
 
05:09:00.890 --> 05:09:00.900 align:start position:0%
current valid link license be modified
 
05:09:03.530 --> 05:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
to use the traditional language which is
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
a license in good standing in another
 
05:09:08.570 --> 05:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction I also wouldn't limit it to
 
05:09:12.288 --> 05:09:12.298 align:start position:0%
State because uh you know DC is a
 
05:09:13.910 --> 05:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction but not necessarily a state
 
05:09:16.250 --> 05:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
I know that's a you know a legal issue
 
05:09:18.890 --> 05:09:18.900 align:start position:0%
but it does create problems for us in
 
05:09:20.930 --> 05:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
the office with that I'm happy to answer
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have
 
05:09:26.270 --> 05:09:26.280 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a very reasonable uh
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
point that was probably overlooked any
 
05:09:33.470 --> 05:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:37.850 --> 05:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:40.250 --> 05:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to testify on House
 
05:09:42.650 --> 05:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
Bill 409
 
05:09:45.050 --> 05:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
right seeing none thank you I'll close
 
05:09:47.510 --> 05:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
the hearing and this will of course be
 
05:09:47.520 --> 05:09:48.410 align:start position:0%
the hearing and this will of course be
uh

05:09:48.410 --> 05:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:09:51.050 --> 05:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
taken over by our professional licensing
 
05:09:53.628 --> 05:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
commit subcommittee
 
05:09:56.448 --> 05:09:56.458 align:start position:0%
all right I think we'll be spending next
 
05:10:00.350 --> 05:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
Friday on this stuff okay and uh we will
