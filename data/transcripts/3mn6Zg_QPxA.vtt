00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
the room clock says 10 o'clock so
 
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
we'll go ahead and get started although
 
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure that's true
 
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
all right I would like to open up the
 
00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
work session on uh SB 71.
 
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
um appreciate everybody being here I
 
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
would like to start the meeting by just
 
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.670 align:start position:0%
would like to start the meeting by just
um

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
logging my complaint that this really
 
00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be with us as much as I'm
 
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
always happy to see the firefighters
 
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
um the content of this bill doesn't
 
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
isn't things that we usually cover or
 
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
are well versed and it's it's really
 
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
more of an insurance issue for the most
 
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
part or other than human services
 
00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
potentially or labor I mean there's
 
00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 align:start position:0%
pretty much everybody but us I don't
 
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
know how we landed with it but we'll do
 
00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 align:start position:0%
our best for that because we're
 
00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
certainly not subject
 
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
experts in this particular area so we'll
 
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
be looking at the two sections of this
 
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
bill the first part
 
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
having to do with the presumption of
 
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
cancer and expanding that in RSA 281 and
 
00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 align:start position:0%
then the new section on a commission to
 
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
study the implementation of optional
 
00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 align:start position:0%
annual cancer screenings uh did either
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
of you guys want to say anything before
 
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
I call anybody up to talk to us
 
00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Representatives
 
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
um Brian rill for the record uh
 
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
president of the professional
 
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 align:start position:0%
firefighters New Hampshire this was uh
 
00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
Ryan could you just get a little bit
 
00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 align:start position:0%
closer sure yeah thanks This was um
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
something that we had uh constructed to
 
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
try and
 
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
get rid of a little bit of ambiguity in
 
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
the current RSA
 
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
um and really just a cleanup of the
 
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
current bill uh at least the first
 
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
portion of this
 
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.350 align:start position:0%
portion of this
um and

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
and we can talk a little bit about uh
 
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
depending on how you want to do things
 
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.810 align:start position:0%
depending on how you want to do things
here

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
um a little bit about why we think it's
 
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
ambiguous and a little bit confusing
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
under current law and what we're looking
 
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
to change
 
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think if we're let's start
 
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
with section one sure um and the idea of
 
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
presumption of cancer I I think that
 
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
language once again we don't hear this
 
00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 align:start position:0%
language frequently in our committee so
 
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
like some clarity on that and how you
 
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 align:start position:0%
guys interpret it at the very least and
 
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
I know that you've brought Mr O'Connor
 
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
in as well to speak to that issue so
 
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
yeah if you wouldn't mind if if you can
 
00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 align:start position:0%
join you that'd be great great
 
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
um so yes
 
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
good morning morning
 
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman Representatives just to give
 
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
a little background my name is Jared
 
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
O'Connor I'm with the firm of Shaheen
 
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
and Gordon and I've been practicing in
 
00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 align:start position:0%
the area of workers compensation for
 
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
about 20 years it's really the sole
 
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
focus of my practice representing
 
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
Injured Workers I'm also on the
 
00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 align:start position:0%
governor's commission to
 
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
establish a review presumption in for
 
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
PTSD in firefighters which I've now been
 
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 align:start position:0%
on for about three years
 
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
as well as the commission for the
 
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
compensation appeals Advisory board that
 
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
reviews the appointments to the
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
compensation appeals board which is the
 
00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 align:start position:0%
body that hears appeals from Department
 
00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
of Labor hearings so just a bit of
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
background on my experience so I thought
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
I'd make myself available at Brian's
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
request to answer any questions you have
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
about how presumptions work or how this
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
particular presumption operates in the
 
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
course of litigation at the labor
 
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 align:start position:0%
department yeah that second part if you
 
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 align:start position:0%
could speak to that I think would be
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
helpful to us how presumption works in
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
the appeal process sure so I guess I'd
 
00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
be way of background
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
in the absence of a presumption which is
 
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
how every worker's comp case works it's
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
always the claimant's burden of proof to
 
00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
establish that a condition is work
 
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
related that the injury arose out of a
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
risk that they're exposed to on the job
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
so it's as the claimant's attorney it's
 
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
our burden to bring forward that medical
 
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
evidence to show that in fact exposure
 
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
to such and such chemicals such and such
 
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
carcinogen is what well not carcinogen
 
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
but you know in the normal workers comp
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
case you have to show that the exposure
 
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
to risk on the job is what caused this
 
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
injury and then bring medical evidence
 
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:49.740 align:start position:0%
to prove that
 
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
what a presumption does what both the
 
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
PTSD presumption that has been passed
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
into law and any other kind of
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
presumption if it's a rebuttable
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
presumption as this is the idea is that
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
it flips the burden of proof so you walk
 
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
into a hearing or into any case with the
 
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
presumption that this injury is work
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
related so that's where the hearing
 
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
officer who's hearing the case is going
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
to begin from that premise that this is
 
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
a work-related injury unless it's proven
 
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
otherwise that's the difference and so
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof of who has to
 
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
establish this or who has to fight
 
00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
against it is shifted from the claimant
 
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
which is normally us to prove that it's
 
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
related it shifts that burden to the
 
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier to prove that it's not
 
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
um which might sound more significant
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
than it is I mean at the end of the day
 
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
the the standard of proof in these
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
workers comp cases is a present a a
 
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence it's more
 
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
likely than not so when we're trying to
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
win a case from the claimant side we
 
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
have to bring in medical evidence to
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
show it's more likely that this injury
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
is work related than not
 
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
what a presumption does what this
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
presumption would do is just flip that
 
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
burden so that now it's on the insurance
 
00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
carrier to prove that it's more likely
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
not work related which is a fairly
 
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
common and frankly easy thing to do from
 
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
uh their perspective you know I guess if
 
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
you're looking more broadly at how the
 
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:19.379 align:start position:0%
cancer presumption has worked in
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
practice and how this would work in its
 
00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
expanded form
 
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
I guess I would say the expansion is not
 
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
that significant in that
 
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
you already have certain gatekeeping
 
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:33.419 align:start position:0%
functions in the statute as to who can
 
00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
even qualify for the presumption in the
 
00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
first place if you look at the statute
 
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
as it exists now
 
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.010 align:start position:0%
as it exists now
the

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
call or fire or volunteer firefighter
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
has to show that they were cancer-free
 
00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
at the time of hire
 
00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:46.490 align:start position:0%
at the time of hire
um

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
the cancer as it exists uh under current
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
law has to be a kind that's recognized
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
by the a iarc the international body
 
00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
that reviews cancer
 
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
and there has to be 10 years of service
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
the employer has to have met certain
 
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
guidelines with regard to following fire
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
standards and training curriculum for
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
Best Practices you have to meet all of
 
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
these before you even qualify for the
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
presumption in the first place
 
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
what this expansion would do is
 
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
basically expand it from The Limited
 
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
number of cancers that are presumed work
 
00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:25.820 align:start position:0%
related now by the iarc to all cancers
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
so as long as those other conditions are
 
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.810 align:start position:0%
so as long as those other conditions are
met

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
met
 
00:09:32.449 --> 00:09:32.459 align:start position:0%
then if the firefighter has cancer then
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
you can make the claim that this is work
 
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.590 align:start position:0%
you can make the claim that this is work
related

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
related
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
the carrier at that point has every
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to deny the claim and then
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
review the medical records and determine
 
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
that well actually no you have a medical
 
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
history you're a remote smoker whatever
 
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
the other issues are and if they have
 
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
medical evidence to show that this is
 
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
not work related then the claim is over
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
so uh for clarification if this language
 
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
were to not go through yeah
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
um could a firefighter still bring a
 
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
claim for other cancers they just
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
wouldn't come with with presumption on
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
their side yeah that's exactly right
 
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
okay so we're not really expanding what
 
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
they can make a claim for just who Bears
 
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof that's exactly right
 
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
yeah anybody
 
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
claim for anything under current law
 
00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:25.019 align:start position:0%
this the question is I mean even with
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
current cancers you may not enjoy the
 
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
benefit of the presumption because the
 
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
cancer you currently have may not fall
 
00:10:33.889 --> 00:10:33.899 align:start position:0%
within the list of the iarc doesn't mean
 
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
you can't file a workers comp claim if
 
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
you have medical evidence to prove that
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's related all the presumption does
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
the presumption is just a procedural
 
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
mechanism it just shifts as you say it
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
shifts the burden of proof so it makes
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
it a little bit easier for Injured
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
Workers to qualify this area you can win
 
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
just on the medical evidence if the
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
medical evidence is strongly against you
 
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
then you're not even going to win with a
 
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
presumption you know you walk into that
 
00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:00.779 align:start position:0%
hearing and the medical evidence
 
00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:02.459 align:start position:0%
strongly points against this cancer
 
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
being work related the fact that their
 
00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:06.779 align:start position:0%
presumption exists isn't particularly
 
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
going to help because the other side the
 
00:11:11.569 --> 00:11:11.579 align:start position:0%
carrier the employer is going to be able
 
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:14.940 align:start position:0%
to show evidence all day long that this
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
is actually a genetic condition that has
 
00:11:18.769 --> 00:11:18.779 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with work you're still
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
going to lose what the presumption does
 
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
is in the very narrow set of cases when
 
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
the medical evidence is genuinely
 
00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:28.019 align:start position:0%
uncertain and it doesn't point in either
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
way either direction that strongly
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
in most workers comp cases Ty goes to
 
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
the employer
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
what the presumption does is that if
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
there is really an equipoise there in
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
terms of the medical evidence Ty goes to
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
the claim it and that kind of thing
 
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:44.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen very often because
 
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
generally speaking the medical evidence
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
is going to point more likely than not
 
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
in One Direction or the other okay
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
representative if I could too um just
 
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:56.540 align:start position:0%
touch on something that Jared mentioned
 
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
the while the benefit of presumption
 
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily A a groundbreaking
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
notion right
 
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339 align:start position:0%
we already have it uh many states
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
already have much more robust uh
 
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
presumption laws in place and while it
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change a lot of the procedures
 
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh for filing a workers comp claim at
 
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:23.700 align:start position:0%
the labor board what this what this does
 
00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:26.459 align:start position:0%
primarily for us in this moment is it
 
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
shows a significant level of support
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
from the state to its firefighters to
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
say look we we have your back we want
 
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
you to get the care and treatment you
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
need we don't want you to suffer
 
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:40.519 align:start position:0%
financially because of that
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
and this is I mean we we've received no
 
00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:47.339 align:start position:0%
opposition on on this portion of it
 
00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:48.839 align:start position:0%
either from the senate or other
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that want to oppose this
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
legislation and I think a lot of that
 
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
has to do with the fact that
 
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
um there's significant medical evidence
 
00:12:59.930 --> 00:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
now that's showing us every day that we
 
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
go to work we're donning personal
 
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
protective equipment uh that actually is
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
littered with pfas chemicals
 
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
um and to do that to protect our
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
communities is uh we believe that the
 
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
presumption is is kind of a
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
um a small well a large for us a large
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
flow of support from the state side to
 
00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:24.899 align:start position:0%
say look we want you to have this
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
benefit of presumption but if your
 
00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
cancer is clearly not work related it
 
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
won't be covered as it currently is not
 
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.769 align:start position:0%
won't be covered as it currently is not
covered

00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
covered
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
um so obviously this is workman's comp
 
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
this isn't health insurance right I mean
 
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
they're two different things
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
um would this have uh potentially in
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
inverse impact on workman's comp rates
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
If This Were to pass do you see that
 
00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
having any impact whatsoever the the
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
impact that it could have would be
 
00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
a marginal increase in the amount of
 
00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
medical costs that the workers comp
 
00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:02.339 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier is going to bear and
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
then therefore you know rates to the
 
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
employer but so it's a question of
 
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
um it's a question of how how many cases
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
end up being approved uh and then the
 
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
medical costs associated with that and I
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
guess what I would say is just to sort
 
00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
of elaborate a little more on what Brian
 
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
was saying
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
having been involved now on the PTSD
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
commission and the change in the law
 
00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:29.220 align:start position:0%
that we had there uh early last year
 
00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
I do I want to speak to that for a
 
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
minute because I think it helps the
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
analogy is basically equivalent so
 
00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:40.519 align:start position:0%
PTSD in firefighters or in any employee
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
had already been covered under workers
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
comp if you have a mental stress claim
 
00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459 align:start position:0%
in workers comp if you can prove that
 
00:14:49.189 --> 00:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's work related then it can be covered
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
under comp and what the commission was
 
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:53.220 align:start position:0%
put together to study was whether there
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
should be a presumption in this subset
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
this subclass of employees that this
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
condition is work related and the reason
 
00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:04.019 align:start position:0%
that it was approved and put into law is
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
the theory behind a presumption at least
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
for PTSD is that unlike other kinds of
 
00:15:10.199 --> 00:15:11.689 align:start position:0%
for PTSD is that unlike other kinds of
workers

00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
workers
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
firefighters First Responders you know
 
00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:18.899 align:start position:0%
EMT police when they take a job they are
 
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
very likely to develop PTSD at some
 
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
point in their career it's sort of it
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
comes with the territory in a way that
 
00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
for example you know if you're a teacher
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
or a 7-Eleven clerk you're not likely to
 
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
have PTSD in the course of your job now
 
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
you might get held up as a 7-Eleven
 
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:36.779 align:start position:0%
Clerk and then develop PTSD because of
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
that one incident and so if that happens
 
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
you have a perfectly valid workers comp
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
claim to say that you have now anxiety
 
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
and stress because of what happened on
 
00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
the job but it's rare it's unusual and
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not why you took the job
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't come with the territory with
 
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
firefighters police EMT Corrections
 
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.990 align:start position:0%
firefighters police EMT Corrections
Officers

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
Officers
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
that kind of mental stress and PTSD it
 
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
comes with the territory you're signing
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
up for that when you take the job like
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know it's likely to happen and
 
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's why the presumption was put in
 
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.949 align:start position:0%
that's why the presumption was put in
place

00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
I would submit that the same kind of
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
thing is happening with regard to cancer
 
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
and firefighters you know the evidence
 
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
is beginning to show and the iarc is
 
00:16:17.769 --> 00:16:17.779 align:start position:0%
developing a rubric to establish that
 
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:21.420 align:start position:0%
the status of being a firefighter is an
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
occupational risk for cancer you know
 
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
it's much more likely that you're going
 
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
to develop cancer As A Firefighter than
 
00:16:29.569 --> 00:16:29.579 align:start position:0%
you are in any other maybe not any other
 
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
but in most other fields of occupation
 
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
and so that's the theory behind why a
 
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
presumption makes sense
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of the Practical effect
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
which is essentially what you're asking
 
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
the PTSD presumption now having been in
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
place for two years what I've seen at
 
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
least in my own practice so this is
 
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
anecdotal but it hasn't prevented
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers from denying claims I
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
still have to mitigate these cases from
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
time to time it's just you know the easy
 
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
cases are approved
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
the easy cases where it's clearly not
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
work related are denied and frankly
 
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
don't get litigated it's again these
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
marginal cases when the evidence could
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
kind of cut either way in the case of a
 
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
PTSD claimant you've got someone who
 
00:17:16.929 --> 00:17:16.939 align:start position:0%
maybe has pre-existing
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
experience in combat or childhood trauma
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
or something like that where there's
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
evidence that suggests well you know
 
00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:25.799 align:start position:0%
they have PTSD but is it work related or
 
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
isn't it and so you hash that out at the
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
labor department
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
this what the cancer presumption does is
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
essentially the same thing you know if
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
there's evidence that cuts both ways you
 
00:17:36.409 --> 00:17:36.419 align:start position:0%
go to the labor department you have a
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
hearing both sides present their
 
00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
evidence and you see what the result is
 
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
the effect of the presumption doesn't
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
prevent either side from going through
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
that due process at the labor department
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
What It ultimately does is again if the
 
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
evidence is a close call on either side
 
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:54.660 align:start position:0%
then it can tilt in favor of the injured
 
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
worker but
 
00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
uh because that is such a small set of
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
cases I think that the the Practical
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
effect the financial impact on
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities is not likely to be
 
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
significantly greater over the long haul
 
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
it just makes
 
00:18:12.289 --> 00:18:12.299 align:start position:0%
it makes the experience of having cancer
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
As A Firefighter dealing with that and
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
getting the treatment that you need a
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
to put it uh in a little one second
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
friend sorry did anybody you guys have
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
any you have any questions Chris
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.950 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
it's been said before that we don't not
 
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
this normally handle something like this
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
and this so but that's okay because I'm
 
00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
ignorant on all things even the ones we
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
do handle
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh the carrier so one of your gentlemen
 
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
said the carrier can deny the claim
 
00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
who's the carrier
 
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
um for most for most firefighters in the
 
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
state it's primex the city of Nashua and
 
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
the City of Manchester are both
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
self-insured but for most other
 
00:18:58.970 --> 00:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state primex tends
 
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
to be the carrier that I see involved in
 
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
and when uh workman's comp case goes
 
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.570 align:start position:0%
and when uh workman's comp case goes
there

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
are they going before New Hampshire
 
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
workman's comp or are they going before
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
the carrier
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
so the way this works is that when a
 
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
claim is filed for a workers comp injury
 
00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
it's presented to that that piece of
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
paper that files the claim is presented
 
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
to the labor department and to the
 
00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:30.059 align:start position:0%
employer's insurance carrier so that
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
piece of paper that says I have a
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
workers comp claim or I'm claiming one
 
00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:36.539 align:start position:0%
goes to the labor department in primex
 
00:19:39.169 --> 00:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
primex then has 21 days to either accept
 
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
the claim or deny it
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
if denied then the claimant has a year
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
and a half to challenge it by requesting
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
a hearing at the labor department so the
 
00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
initial brief investigation is done by
 
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
the insurance carrier but the hearing to
 
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
actually present evidence present expert
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
reports get testimony if necessary that
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
goes to the labor department so a
 
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
hearing is held
 
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
here in Concord at the labor department
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
with appeal rights thereafter
 
00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:10.850 align:start position:0%
I've only got 12. that's less than usual
 
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.710 align:start position:0%
I've only got 12. that's less than usual
[Laughter]

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
so if the if the carrier
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't deny the claim does it go to
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
labor department workman's comp if the
 
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
carrier accepts the claim then there's
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
no need to go to the labor department
 
00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
right they just accept it and can pay
 
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:28.740 align:start position:0%
although I should say having accepted
 
00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:30.299 align:start position:0%
the claim doesn't mean that they're
 
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
irrevocably bound to pay forever they're
 
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
always free at some point in the future
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
to say all right well we now question
 
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
whether this remains related
 
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
um and they they have ongoing rights to
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
so on on section two the notwithstanding
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
path yeah
 
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:51.770 align:start position:0%
path yeah
[Music]

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:57.710 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
I guess what is it notwithstanding
 
00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.270 align:start position:0%
I guess what is it notwithstanding
sections

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
now withstanding section 216 and 27.
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
yeah right at the beginning yep yep so
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
if this became law
 
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
if a firefighter claims
 
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
a cancerous
 
00:21:21.169 --> 00:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
situation is caused by his job
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's on
 
00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.370 align:start position:0%
whether it's on
the

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
list now right
 
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:30.500 align:start position:0%
it it would be
 
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
assumed that the cancer was job related
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
and it seems like
 
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:40.980 align:start position:0%
that makes the carrier or or workman's
 
00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
comp hearing
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
prove the negative
 
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
and I don't know how you prove the
 
00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
negative so okay that's essentially
 
00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:50.940 align:start position:0%
right that that's the point of a
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
presumption is that it it there's a
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
prima facial presumption Prima fascia
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
just means that in the first instance
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to assume this is work
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
related unless you can prove it's not
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
and so it does shift the burden of
 
00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
production of producing evidence to
 
00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
Prime X to then show that this cancer is
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
not work related the way they do that
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
and the way they do that in the PTSD
 
00:22:18.409 --> 00:22:18.419 align:start position:0%
cases I'm involved with for example is
 
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
they have the right once a workers comp
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
claim is filed to get the claimant's
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
medical records historical records
 
00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:27.059 align:start position:0%
having anything to do with the claimed
 
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
injury so they have a right to gather
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
those records to have those records
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
reviewed by their own expert and that
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
expert can then say
 
00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
because of whether other environmental
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
exposures because of your personal
 
00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
history because of genetic history that
 
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
I can say as primex's expert this is not
 
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
in fact due to your exposure as
 
00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:51.299 align:start position:0%
firefighter it's due to
 
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
obesity smoking whatever and so they
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
then present that to the labor
 
00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
department the labor department has the
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
authority to review those expert reports
 
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
and say this is more credible the denial
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
is upheld
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
or not depending on how the litigation
 
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.810 align:start position:0%
or not depending on how the litigation
goes

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not going to add to
 
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:10.970 align:start position:0%
representative I'm not going to add to
that

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
um just recently we had a case in Dover
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
of testicular cancer which is a cancer
 
00:23:21.049 --> 00:23:21.059 align:start position:0%
that's currently covered under the iarc
 
00:23:21.059 --> 00:23:21.970 align:start position:0%
that's currently covered under the iarc
list

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:21.980 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:25.980 align:start position:0%
that claim was denied and the subsequent
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
review of IT upheld the denial based on
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
other factors so they were able to the
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
Not only was the workers comp carrier
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
able to deny the claim even though
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
on its on its face it met every one of
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
the benchmarks upon further review the
 
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
upheld the denial and the member did not
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
get the Pres the presumptive or the
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
workers comp coverage so
 
00:23:54.289 --> 00:23:54.299 align:start position:0%
um as Jared mentioned earlier it is a
 
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
fairly easy Benchmark to reach in order
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
to continue to deny these claims whether
 
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
or not the presumption's in place
 
00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:07.610 align:start position:0%
or not the presumption's in place
right

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
you can continue if you had something
 
00:24:10.909 --> 00:24:10.919 align:start position:0%
else sure thank you I just wanted to
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
touch on
 
00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:15.299 align:start position:0%
um kind of expand upon the
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
the reason why the expansion makes sense
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
to us uh the the current language refers
 
00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
to uh that it must be a cancer involved
 
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
must be a type which may be caused by
 
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
exposure to heat radiation or a known
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
carcinogen as defined by the
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
international Agency for research on
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
cancer now when you go to look for that
 
00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
list of cancers that must be caused by
 
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
exposure to heat radiation or known
 
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
carcinogen and this was a link that I
 
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
sent to all to all the committee members
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
the iarc has a a monograph a list it's I
 
00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
believe 14 pages long of all types of
 
00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:59.890 align:start position:0%
believe 14 pages long of all types of
cancers

00:24:59.890 --> 00:24:59.900 align:start position:0%
cancers
 
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that specifically
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
States uh
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
exposure to heat radiation or known
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
carcinogen and in fact the language at
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
the top of the form refers to
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
carcinogens that are likely to occur in
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
humans and that's the entire list
 
00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.310 align:start position:0%
humans and that's the entire list
um

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
so in 2018 when this legislation was
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
passed that was put in there
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
to try and click make some
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
clarifications as to what was covered
 
00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
and what was not
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
um to my knowledge the intention was to
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
cover the cancers on that list
 
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:39.299 align:start position:0%
and in turn if you take it if you
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
dissect it further you can you
 
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
some have pulled out about seven cancers
 
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
that are actually covered from the iarc
 
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:50.940 align:start position:0%
but then if you look at uh
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
previous reports from the iarc from 2010
 
00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
there's at least an additional eight
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
that should be covered by this same
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
organization and they're not they're not
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
being covered right now or at least
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
under our presumptive legislation so who
 
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
interprets that so that well that would
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
be a labor board decision but
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
um I know that the researcher for the
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
committee sent out an email that said
 
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:19.740 align:start position:0%
there were these seven cancers were
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
covered but you can you can search I
 
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
mean they there's articles from the IRC
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
um that I can even I'll read it to you
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
uh 2010 report from the iirc considers
 
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
there to be sufficient evidence for
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
firefighter exposures causing the
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
following types of cancers that are not
 
00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:42.299 align:start position:0%
listed in those seven and it lists an
 
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
additional eight cancers
 
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.890 align:start position:0%
additional eight cancers
um

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.269 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
further to that the CDC uh cites an
 
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
additional nine cancers that are on
 
00:26:54.769 --> 00:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
neither one of those lists that
 
00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:56.820 align:start position:0%
firefighters are at increased risk for
 
00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.070 align:start position:0%
firefighters are at increased risk for
so

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
um it's the the list is not exhaustive
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
of what we're what we have increased
 
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
exposure to and that's what we're trying
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
to to figure out here it's not you know
 
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to bamboozle the system
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
and say we should be covered for
 
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
everything that's why there are all
 
00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:16.100 align:start position:0%
these other as Jared mentions
 
00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:18.179 align:start position:0%
requirements to get through the gate in
 
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
the first place and then there's this
 
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
review process that really determines
 
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
we are eligible to receive receive the
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
coverage right
 
00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.930 align:start position:0%
coverage right
okay

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:31.789 --> 00:27:31.799 align:start position:0%
any other questions guys
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
is anybody from the labor board here
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
they don't seem to be too worried about
 
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
it now as I mentioned um I mean this
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
went through the Senate uh Edna five to
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
zero and it passed the Senate uh in
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
quick Fashion on a Voice vote
 
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.330 align:start position:0%
quick Fashion on a Voice vote
unanimously

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
unanimously
 
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
um there was no opposition in the Senate
 
00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
I I think and I'm just speculating here
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
but I think realistically
 
00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
um just that case that I mentioned about
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
the testicular cancer really the
 
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
requirements to refute a presumptive
 
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.470 align:start position:0%
requirements to refute a presumptive
claim

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
claim
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
um are not that difficult at the moment
 
00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:12.179 align:start position:0%
um so I think that maybe why there's not
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
a ton of pushback on this great
 
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else in the room that's
 
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
kind of a subject matter expert that can
 
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
add something that hasn't been stated
 
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:25.430 align:start position:0%
add something that hasn't been stated
already

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
thank you gentlemen we may call you back
 
00:28:36.409 --> 00:28:36.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Christian Cyril I'm the
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
chief property and casually actuary at
 
00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:40.460 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire insurance department
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's going to add anything
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
but it's just gonna
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
kind of support what Jared said
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
regarding rates so there was the
 
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
question about how it might affect
 
00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.710 align:start position:0%
question about how it might affect
premiums

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
premiums
 
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.490 align:start position:0%
premiums
um

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
so two points to that as Jared mentioned
 
00:28:58.250 --> 00:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
um if it if it does have an effect it
 
00:28:59.810 --> 00:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
would certainly
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
um affect premiums on the increase
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
because you are
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
the the end result would likely be more
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
claims and then over time those claims
 
00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
would affect rates however
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
again it is quite likely that the number
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
of additional claims would be quite
 
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.669 align:start position:0%
of additional claims would be quite
minimal

00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
minimal
 
00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
in the grand scheme of workers comp
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
claims for firefighters and don't forget
 
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
firefighters will only make up one part
 
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
of the pool of
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
of folks that are insured through primex
 
00:29:35.529 --> 00:29:35.539 align:start position:0%
so primex generally handles
 
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
municipalities and so
 
00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
it would be I would expect it to be
 
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
quite minimal the um the other thing to
 
00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
mention is primex is not regulated by
 
00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
our department
 
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
um primex is the pool that handles
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and so um
 
00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
that oversight goes through the
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office and labor
 
00:29:59.870 --> 00:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
department but just from an Actuarial
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
perspective would probably be quite
 
00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:03.289 align:start position:0%
perspective would probably be quite
minimal

00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299 align:start position:0%
minimal
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that I'd like to ask
 
00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:09.539 align:start position:0%
a question about or just have you keep
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
in mind the other portion of the bill
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
that talks about
 
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
um the screening
 
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
Jared might know this as well but from
 
00:30:21.649 --> 00:30:21.659 align:start position:0%
my perspective in looking at workers
 
00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:24.299 align:start position:0%
comp that would be unusual in a workers
 
00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
comp system and so there might be
 
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.010 align:start position:0%
comp system and so there might be
questions

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
for primex or carriers as to
 
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
how that cost would be
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
would be shared and how that cost would
 
00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:38.220 align:start position:0%
be studied and how that might affect uh
 
00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
premium but that might be a question for
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
it would be mission for the commission
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
probably if we format yeah it doesn't
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
exist yet um and just for clarification
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
for everybody uh workman's comp claim in
 
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
this scenario isn't more expensive than
 
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
another kind of workman's comp claim
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily or is it
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
you mean through primex because yeah so
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
if somebody makes a Cancer claim it's
 
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
the same as another kind of working on
 
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
claim together
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
um what do they call it like like work
 
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
related uh illness diagnosis like like
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
carpal tunnel or something like that you
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
know where it's it it progresses over
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
time and there isn't one particular
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:26.700 align:start position:0%
you know accident or incident and and
 
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
but that happens in all sorts of
 
00:31:30.409 --> 00:31:30.419 align:start position:0%
different occupations okay great thank
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
you for that clarification
 
00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:34.740 align:start position:0%
any questions guys yes representative
 
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.570 align:start position:0%
any questions guys yes representative
true

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
I know you I know you said that in your
 
00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
opinion the
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
the workman's comp rates
 
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
may go up
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
or probably would but it would be very
 
00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:50.580 align:start position:0%
small amount
 
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
yeah it's impossible to tell
 
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
um and again this takes many many years
 
00:31:58.909 --> 00:31:58.919 align:start position:0%
or because it's not as if it is very
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
unlikely that primex would change their
 
00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
rates because of this change in the law
 
00:32:06.649 --> 00:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
it is they would wait to see how the law
 
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
affects claims
 
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
um because there are
 
00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
kind of opposing
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
you know forces here
 
00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
there is the POS like if there's that
 
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
presumption you know then there might be
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
fewer arguments there might be you know
 
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
fewer fewer legal battles that go on
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
because there are more claims that they
 
00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
know they're going to pay you know
 
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.630 align:start position:0%
know they're going to pay you know
um

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
and so they may they may save costs on
 
00:32:39.649 --> 00:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
defense or or legal expenses and that
 
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
would be might get converted over to
 
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
Indemnity or medical payments there's
 
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
the other piece where if you know if the
 
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
commission over time ends up approving
 
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
and recommending and then we go into
 
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
um you know this you know the cancer
 
00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.049 align:start position:0%
um you know this you know the cancer
screening

00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:57.059 align:start position:0%
screening
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
that could have the effect of reducing
 
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
medical costs over time and so you just
 
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
you know they're so yes there might be
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
more claims but they might be less
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
expensive it's very difficult to tell
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
how all those different variables will
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
will kind of work off each other
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
yep yeah but intuitively yes it would be
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
more expensive
 
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
but details will will come with time
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
so on
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
so for primex
 
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
you don't know how they're going to
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
react or what they're going to say as a
 
00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
company whatever but
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't say oh my god look they
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
just passed this law and now we have to
 
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
jack up the rates to cover
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
future costs
 
00:33:39.779 --> 00:33:41.570 align:start position:0%
future costs
um

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
they would be more apt to say
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
over the course of 20 years
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
more cancers were covered under
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
workman's comp and therefore we're going
 
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
to raise the rates
 
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
right if I was primex's actuary I I
 
00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
would recommend
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
wait and see primex you know as as a
 
00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:02.690 align:start position:0%
wait and see primex you know as as a
pool

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
pool
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
right I mean
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how that pool is
 
00:34:07.679 --> 00:34:09.950 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how that pool is
structured

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
structured
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
I mean it isn't a for-profit
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
organization right so
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
they you know they have
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
a board
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
you know they answer to ultimately the
 
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office
 
00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:25.859 align:start position:0%
they need to justify their actions and
 
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
their decisions and their rates to
 
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.849 align:start position:0%
their decisions and their rates to
someone

00:34:28.849 --> 00:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:34:28.859 --> 00:34:30.010 align:start position:0%
someone
um

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:30.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
my guess is that would wait and see they
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
would wait and see you know thank you
 
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
for that piece of information it's I
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that primex wasn't a
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
for-profit organization that's a helpful
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
piece of information
 
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
once again not our subject matter most
 
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
of the time so we're learning a bunch of
 
00:34:50.329 --> 00:34:50.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead so that that brings up 13
 
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
more questions I'll keep it to one
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
so so who is primex so primex is is
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
is the all the municipalities in New
 
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.450 align:start position:0%
is the all the municipalities in New
Hampshire

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.829 align:start position:0%

pooling

00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
pooling
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
their risk is that what primex is right
 
00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:10.550 align:start position:0%
their risk is that what primex is right
and

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
Jared may know something about this as
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
well so feel free to join him too if
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's helpful
 
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
it's it's very um very laid back
 
00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know to what extent primex is
 
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
the hired
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
um adjuster and and uh kind of the
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
logistics service provider for the pool
 
00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:35.220 align:start position:0%
or whether primex is itself the pool
 
00:35:37.569 --> 00:35:37.579 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
what are you referring to is like
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes if you wouldn't mind speaking
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
like just because it's also recorded
 
00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
sure we can we can hear you but they can
 
00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:46.250 align:start position:0%
sure we can we can hear you but they can
um

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
what he's referring to is that in some
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
instances like for example like the city
 
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
of Manchester in the city of Nashville
 
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
are both self-insured for workers comp
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
meaning they pay all of the costs of the
 
00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
workers comp claims that come before
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
them but they don't themselves well
 
00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:02.300 align:start position:0%
Nashua kind of does but Manchester
 
00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
doesn't administer the claims they hire
 
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
what's called a third party
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
administrator to administer the claims
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
and file the paperwork and keep track of
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
medical bill denisles and just handle
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
the day-to-day operations of the workers
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
comp activity but the checks that are
 
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:20.460 align:start position:0%
actually written for people's weekly
 
00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
Indemnity or disability benefits and all
 
00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
the medical benefits come from the city
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
so that's Manchester and Nashua but for
 
00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
all other municipalities it's primex and
 
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
again I don't know the answer whether
 
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
primex is just a third party
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
administrator that I I don't think they
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
are I think they are the insurer and I
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
think municipalities just pay the
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
pay the insurance premiums to primex
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
you're good representative
 
00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.550 align:start position:0%
you're good representative
okay

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.410 align:start position:0%
okay
great

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:36:59.450 --> 00:36:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
um do you guys want to hear anything
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
else on the first section are you
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
comfortable moving to the second section
 
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
at least information gathering West okay
 
00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:08.099 align:start position:0%
great so Mr rill if you want to address
 
00:37:08.099 --> 00:37:10.490 align:start position:0%
great so Mr rill if you want to address
again

00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
walk us through the study commission
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
which there was one a few years ago
 
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
right that's how we got the first
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
presumptive language but this one's
 
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
going to be looking at something a
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:25.140 align:start position:0%
so yes I apparently so uh I wasn't I
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't around for that but um
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
so the intent and it's it's no ass
 
00:37:32.569 --> 00:37:32.579 align:start position:0%
actually if you can hang on for just a
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
second Steve can you come up for a
 
00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
sure for the record Representative Steve
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
Pearson Rockingham District
 
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.550 align:start position:0%
Pearson Rockingham District
13

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
13
 
00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:50.099 align:start position:0%
which encompasses Dairy what was that
 
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
what was the primary focus of that study
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
commission so that study commission
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
occurred uh prior to me being a
 
00:37:59.210 --> 00:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
legislator I was involved in the
 
00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:01.619 align:start position:0%
corrective they did a
 
00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:04.020 align:start position:0%
um language cleanup like we like to call
 
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:04.730 align:start position:0%
um language cleanup like we like to call
it

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:08.339 align:start position:0%
my first term as a they missed something
 
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
when they filed that that first bit of
 
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
presumptive language
 
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:14.690 align:start position:0%
presumptive language
um

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
the term before my father was actually a
 
00:38:23.089 --> 00:38:23.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
as this body tends to do when we come up
 
00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
with a new concept we love to we have
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
what do we have 300 commissions and
 
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
committees that exist right so they
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
looked at this as gen in generalities in
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
in kind of holistically as my
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
understanding and then brought forward
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
the legislation that we have which
 
00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.550 align:start position:0%
the legislation that we have which
currently

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
definitely has holes and problems in it
 
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
um and that's why we're this language is
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
now before you guys again to as I will
 
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
call it a second revision to fix a
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
couple of other things that came as a
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
result of the 20
 
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
I think it was 20 yeah 18 or 2016.
 
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
commission that happened but I didn't
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
sit on it but that's that's my
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
understanding haven't been involved in
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
the first language cleanup Bill okay
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
okay so just it might be beneficial to
 
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
take a look at that and see if there's
 
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
any useful information in it since it's
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
already been done
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
um not saying that that affects whether
 
00:39:23.089 --> 00:39:23.099 align:start position:0%
or not we do this one I'm just saying
 
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
it's out there so we can we have access
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
to it one of the things that's happening
 
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:29.450 align:start position:0%
right now
um

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
is twofold one the focus within the fire
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
service on cancer has really just
 
00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
expanded dramatically as the revelations
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
of things have come forward
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's part of it the other thing
 
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
that's happened and
 
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
it's in 2023
 
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
is for 200 years firemen have been
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
fighting fire and fighting cancer but
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
now women are entering this profession
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
in numbers never seen before
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
so the kind of the Baseline that we have
 
00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:04.619 align:start position:0%
of the of the concept of a common cancer
 
00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
amongst men is is there we're
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
establishing those those baselines based
 
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
on historical data what we have for
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
women in this profession is nothing
 
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.470 align:start position:0%
women in this profession is nothing
nothing

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
so when you when you come up with a list
 
00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
of cancers under under presumption to
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
say okay these are the common things you
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
know we talk about testicular cancer
 
00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
what we don't have in these presumptive
 
00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
lists is things that are specific to
 
00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:32.089 align:start position:0%
lists is things that are specific to
women

00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
women
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
and that's why the idea of going that's
 
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
why this bill's idea of saying look
 
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
let's not be solely restricted to a
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
small list of things in an emerging
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
field of study
 
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
that has really only ever been studied
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
in men
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
and that's why this
 
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
this particular legislation that passed
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
can address the the continuing changes
 
00:40:59.450 --> 00:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
that are ongoing and not having to
 
00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
continuously revisit every every two
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
years this type of legislation to add
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
another cancer or another variant or
 
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.849 align:start position:0%
another cancer or another variant or
another

00:41:09.849 --> 00:41:09.859 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
circumstance you see what I'm saying
 
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
because we get we get into the weeds I
 
00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
mean you've we all see the commercials
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
on TV you know types type 17 non-hodgkin
 
00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
whatever and you look at that and go
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
what the hell is that thing well what if
 
00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
you're type 16 or 14 or whatever and as
 
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
a 27 year firefighter I can tell you
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
that there's two words that scare the
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
hell out of us one is layoff and two is
 
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.630 align:start position:0%
hell out of us one is layoff and two is
cancer

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
so having to go through a battle and go
 
00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
through this process of of having a some
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
sort of a weird list that has to
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
constantly be changed and amended
 
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
responsively instead of proactively
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
is just another example of how
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
government is just either too slow or
 
00:41:58.609 --> 00:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
or just too behind things and I think
 
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
this takes care of that and you know
 
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
obviously as you heard from attorney
 
00:42:08.050 --> 00:42:08.060 align:start position:0%
O'Connor you know this is not
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
in in people's minds when they Define
 
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
presumption or they Define a process in
 
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
their own head as we've learned that's
 
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
really just not how it is so I I think
 
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:19.500 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
is a truly important thing for the for
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
that profession for the reasons I listed
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
and I think it would just be another
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
situation where the legislature can just
 
00:42:31.069 --> 00:42:31.079 align:start position:0%
put an end to something
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
um so much like part one of this uh in
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
the expansion this the study commission
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
portion of this while it's it's
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
Progressive in nature it's certainly not
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
groundbreaking other states uh other
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
states are doing these screenings now
 
00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:54.599 align:start position:0%
and I wanna what I want to be clear
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
about is this is not a a commission to
 
00:42:59.690 --> 00:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
study whether or not screenings are
 
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
appropriate or whether or not
 
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
firefighters should be getting screened
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
for cancer we we know that uh should be
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
beneficial for all of us right
 
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
um what this Commission
 
00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
uh would be tasked hopefully with doing
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
would be determining how to implement a
 
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
process and a program that would include
 
00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:23.030 align:start position:0%
process and a program that would include
uh

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
things like
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
what's the cost going to be to implement
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
this program who's going to pay for it
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
where's the is there going to be a cost
 
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
sharing is the state interested in that
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
cost sharing uh how much will the
 
00:43:38.809 --> 00:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
employee have to pay what type of
 
00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
screenings are necessary
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing this now are
 
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
the programs successful
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
administratively how would a program
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
like this be be put together
 
00:43:53.809 --> 00:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
um these are all things that we want to
 
00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
take a look at
 
00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
New Jersey is already doing cancer
 
00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
screenings for firefighters
 
00:44:00.599 --> 00:44:01.370 align:start position:0%
screenings for firefighters
um

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is already doing cancer
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
screenings for firefighters we actually
 
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:08.579 align:start position:0%
have local some local municipalities in
 
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
the state now that are doing some form
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
or another of cancer screenings for
 
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
firefighters in fact
 
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
um there's and I won't break the news
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
early but there's a community in our
 
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
state that has worked with insurance
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
providers and Dartmouth Hitchcock and is
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
looking to implement cancer screenings
 
00:44:33.609 --> 00:44:33.619 align:start position:0%
for firefighters this is not new stuff
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
it is Progressive in nature but it's not
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
like I said oh my God I can't believe
 
00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:41.220 align:start position:0%
that you know we're going to be
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to look at
 
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:44.940 align:start position:0%
doing cancer screenings for firefighters
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
it's already being done so you know
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
rather than come in here and and say
 
00:44:53.809 --> 00:44:53.819 align:start position:0%
can we have
 
00:44:55.970 --> 00:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars or 100 million
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
dollars or however much money to say we
 
00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:00.599 align:start position:0%
want to implement skin cancer screenings
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
we want to do chest x-rays we want to do
 
00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
CAT scans we want to do whatever other
 
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
cancer screening is available and here's
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
the cost to it and being laughed out of
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
the room we'd rather do this
 
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.410 align:start position:0%
the room we'd rather do this
purposefully

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:14.420 align:start position:0%
purposefully
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
and and sit down and work with all of
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
you and say let's look at how a program
 
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
like this could be implemented and then
 
00:45:23.569 --> 00:45:23.579 align:start position:0%
bring it back to the legislature at a
 
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
later date and say can we implement it
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
so that's the purpose for part two and
 
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's no accident that these were placed
 
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
together as was mentioned earlier by the
 
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the insurance agency
 
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.809 align:start position:0%
gentleman from the insurance agency
um

00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:38.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
there could potentially be however small
 
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
a slight increase in workers
 
00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:48.380 align:start position:0%
compensation premiums over time
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
you've heard everybody testify here that
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
if that happens it's going to be minimal
 
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
but it could happen nonetheless now this
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
study commission portion is attached to
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
it because we believe that if there are
 
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:04.140 align:start position:0%
cancer screenings in place
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
early detection and early treatment are
 
00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
going to drive costs of treatment down
 
00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:13.140 align:start position:0%
and so claims are going to be less in
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
the long run and that's how this how
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
these programs have been so successful
 
00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
um throughout other states is that
 
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
they've been able to get insurance uh
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
companies riskable providers medical
 
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
providers and municipalities on board
 
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
with implementing something like this
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah Steve if you wouldn't mind letting
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
just I just wanted to sorry I just
 
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up on that last thing
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
that Brian was saying which is that what
 
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
he just mentioned is exactly how it has
 
00:46:56.329 --> 00:46:56.339 align:start position:0%
worked with the PTSD presumption which
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
is that the law was changed to put the
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
PTSD presumption into place and the
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
commission remains active in meeting on
 
00:47:05.270 --> 00:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis to review its effect
 
00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
both on rates and on the community at
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
large and how it's working in practice
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
just thought that was worth noting is
 
00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:13.980 align:start position:0%
that that's that's how that structure
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
has worked with the with regard to the
 
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
presumption for PTSD and First
 
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
Responders great thank you so much
 
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.589 align:start position:0%
Responders great thank you so much
thanks

00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:47:23.089 --> 00:47:23.099 align:start position:0%
Penny further questions from the
 
00:47:23.099 --> 00:47:24.470 align:start position:0%
Penny further questions from the
committee

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:47:28.609 --> 00:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
thoughts yeah
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so there's a
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
commission doing this now no there was a
 
00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
commission back in either 2016-2018 that
 
00:47:40.309 --> 00:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
brought that original presumptive
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
language that we're looking at into law
 
00:47:46.609 --> 00:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
that was their recommendation so
 
00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
um we're not going to vote on anything
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
today we'll vote tomorrow morning when
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
we have everybody here Peter and Jason
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
should be with us so
 
00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.770 align:start position:0%
should be with us so
um

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:56.809 --> 00:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
but looking at the amendment that
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
representative true brought forward
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
it's not ready for prime time okay I
 
00:48:08.329 --> 00:48:08.339 align:start position:0%
don't think I'd have one ready for
 
00:48:08.339 --> 00:48:10.609 align:start position:0%
don't think I'd have one ready for
tomorrow

00:48:10.609 --> 00:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
I'd probably wait and see how the
 
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
committee felt if the committee wanted
 
00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:17.339 align:start position:0%
to go try to come up with an amendment
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
that we all agreed with
 
00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
fine but but he is
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
here's what I was attempting to do with
 
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
the with my Amendment and and granted
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's not right
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
change the the Sunset date to November
 
00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
1st 2024. so that they actually have
 
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
some time to do it so because that was
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned in in our first in our hearing
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
that 2023 was even though it was worded
 
00:48:53.809 --> 00:48:53.819 align:start position:0%
wrong wasn't enough time to do the to do
 
00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:56.339 align:start position:0%
what work had to be done
 
00:48:56.339 --> 00:48:57.770 align:start position:0%
what work had to be done
um

00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
another change I made was to change the
 
00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
attorney appointed by the New Hampshire
 
00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
Association of Justice
 
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
a uh my notes said Marissa Chase
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
representing the trial lawyers of New
 
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire asked if they be
 
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
replaced that so I put that in
 
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
um however
 
00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
and I gave everyone a copy of uh house
 
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
bills 1269 from from last year
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
the way this commission is set up
 
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
the legislature is not the majority and
 
00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
according to that law the legislature
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
legislatures must be the majority of the
 
00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.329 align:start position:0%
legislatures must be the majority of the
commission

00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:49:38.339 --> 00:49:39.650 align:start position:0%
commission
so

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
right now and this is not not a change
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
this is something I found after I got
 
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:53.339 align:start position:0%
the most members the commission can have
 
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:55.020 align:start position:0%
is 15.
 
00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
and eight of those must be from the
 
00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:59.930 align:start position:0%
and eight of those must be from the
legislature

00:49:59.930 --> 00:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
I think the the general feeling was
 
00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.890 align:start position:0%
I think the the general feeling was
because

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
we have a boss
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
driving that that car right
 
00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:15.119 align:start position:0%
so that that's another change that will
 
00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to we'd have to pull one
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
other representative or one other member
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:50:23.329 --> 00:50:23.339 align:start position:0%
outside of the legislature off and
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
replace it with a legislative member yes
 
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
so and then the question would be who do
 
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
you cut out right
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
um that's why I didn't bother doing
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
another one because who am I to say I'll
 
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:37.140 align:start position:0%
leave that up to the uh
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
to the the sponsor or the committee
 
00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:40.970 align:start position:0%
to the the sponsor or the committee
assignments

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
assignments
 
00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:44.990 align:start position:0%
assignments
okay

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.809 --> 00:50:50.819 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:50:50.819 --> 00:50:55.490 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
okay why don't we reach this recess this
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
until tomorrow morning we have another
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
meeting in this room at nine uh to look
 
00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
at this again and I'll make sure that
 
00:51:05.089 --> 00:51:05.099 align:start position:0%
the other guys are going to be here for
 
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
that and uh in the meantime I'll do a
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
little bit more digging on the
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
makeup of the commission and what that
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
00:51:13.859 --> 00:51:15.049 align:start position:0%
looks like
um

00:51:15.049 --> 00:51:15.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
and we'll see if we can pull something
 
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
together for tomorrow because we're
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to exec it tomorrow afternoon
 
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
oh yeah it's scheduled I mean I'm sure
 
00:51:24.049 --> 00:51:24.059 align:start position:0%
that Carol could recess it if she wants
 
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
to but we're scheduled for tomorrow
 
00:51:27.770 --> 00:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
because we're not going to wrap
 
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
everything up tomorrow right no we have
 
00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
one more on the 23rd of May I think so
 
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
there is one more work day
 
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:34.910 align:start position:0%
there is one more work day
um

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.530 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
sure any other thoughts nope all right
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
I'll go I'll go ahead and research
 
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
recess the work session on the SB 71
