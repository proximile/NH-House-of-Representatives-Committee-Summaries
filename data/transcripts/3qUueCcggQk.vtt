so on the second
 
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
if you skip the introduction one so the
 
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
second the second um
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
slide is an overview of the Department's
 
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
organizational structure uh I introduce
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
myself I'm the commissioner and we have
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
two uh other Commissioners Dave the
 
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner and Deputy

Commissioner Andre Brier who isn't here
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
but we oversee five divisions so the
 
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
department is
 
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.990 align:start position:0%
department is
um

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
organized into five to five divisions
 
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
Dave is the assistant commissioner and
 
00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 align:start position:0%
chief engineer kind of oversees the
 
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 align:start position:0%
operations uh and project development
 
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
side of the house so that's all of the
 
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
projects that that we do and all of the
 
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
operations of the day-to-day maintenance
 
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
of the of the system and uh he'll give
 
00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 align:start position:0%
you a little bit more detail on that
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the house the
 
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner kind of oversees
 
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 align:start position:0%
um more of the administrative
 
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
administrative functions a division of
 
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.710 align:start position:0%
administrative functions a division of
finance

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
finance
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
policy and administration as well as the
 
00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:35.029 align:start position:0%
policy and administration as well as the
um

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh Aeronautics Rail and Tron Aeronautics
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
Rail and Transit the non-highway type of
 
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 align:start position:0%
uh Transportation aspects that we
 
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.409 align:start position:0%
uh Transportation aspects that we
oversee

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 align:start position:0%
oversee
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
so on the next slide just to give some
 
00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
scope and breadth as a overview of
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
um you know some keep acts about the
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
D.O.T we have a
 
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
um we have about 1650 permanent
 
00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.570 align:start position:0%
um we have about 1650 permanent
positions

00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
um that's not that many employees those
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
are positions because we are dealing
 
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
with uh some vacancy rates which I'll
 
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
um discuss later with if we get into
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges that the
 
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 align:start position:0%
department is facing
 
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
2159 State bridges that uh that we
 
00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:18.770 align:start position:0%
2159 State bridges that uh that we
maintain

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh the state red list that's the number
 
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
of structurally deficient Bridges
 
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
um of that 2159 114 are red listed or
 
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
structurally deficient and we have been
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
working to drive that number down
 
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:36.860 align:start position:0%
in addition to the um
 
00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 align:start position:0%
2160 state state Bridges
 
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
um there are around 1700 Municipal
 
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
bridges in this in the state those are
 
00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:47.819 align:start position:0%
bridges owned
 
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
um by the municipalities but the dot is
 
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
responsible for uh ensuring their safety
 
00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
so we inspect all of the municipal
 
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:00.300 align:start position:0%
Bridges and all of the state bridges on
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
our goal our delivery is to try to
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
inspect every bridge in the state at
 
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
least once every two years
 
00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:10.139 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there's a redless
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
Bridges uh get get more eyes on them
 
00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
they were viewed usually once every six
 
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
months to make sure that their condition
 
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
is stained
 
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
so we oversee about 4 600 Centerline
 
00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
miles of roadway
 
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
um and on that we maintain uh over a
 
00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:28.379 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand highway signs we try to
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
stripe uh every Road in the state once a
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
year that's our goal it means about 68
 
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419 align:start position:0%
million feet of striping
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
as well as 440 traffic signs 550 beacons
 
00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
we oversee uh 194 miles of active
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
state-owned Rail lines
 
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
25 publicly accessible airports and 11
 
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
local public transit systems that fall
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
under our domain or at least the
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
administration and the funding that
 
00:08:59.930 --> 00:08:59.940 align:start position:0%
passes through dot to help support those
 
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.730 align:start position:0%
passes through dot to help support those
services

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
so that's just a quick
 
00:09:03.839 --> 00:09:04.430 align:start position:0%
so that's just a quick
um

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:06.899 align:start position:0%
some factoids that give the scope and
 
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:10.740 align:start position:0%
breadth of our oversight on in the state
 
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.570 align:start position:0%
breadth of our oversight on in the state
um

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959 align:start position:0%
on the fifth page I guess is a budget
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
overview it gives a quick very high
 
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:20.540 align:start position:0%
level snapshot of what rfy
 
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
2022 actual expenditures were so
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
um almost 600 million dollars of actual
 
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.030 align:start position:0%
um almost 600 million dollars of actual
expenditures

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
and we try to organize our budget and
 
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
talk about it and and two main
 
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
um two main pieces two main aspects uh
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
the municipal Aid and construction part
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the budget
 
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
um a little over 300 million dollars
 
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
is a lot of the uh pass-through money
 
00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:48.899 align:start position:0%
money that comes through the dot two
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
cities and towns and a big part of that
 
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:52.740 align:start position:0%
is also the federal dollars that come to
 
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.170 align:start position:0%
is also the federal dollars that come to
support

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
um the highway program the construction
 
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
program that we put out
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
the other piece of the budget is
 
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
um you know what a lot of the focus is
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh this year with the budget is the
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
operating uh budget which
 
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
um is all the men and women that um make
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
up the dot and all the uh materials and
 
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
supplies and things that we use in
 
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
maintaining the roads and that's around
 
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:20.220 align:start position:0%
200 and a little under 300 million
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
dollars about 282 million in FY 22
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
expenditures so
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
um one of the things for division two uh
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
and I think we'll get into more detail
 
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
um it's a rather complicated budget
 
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
because we deal with a lot of different
 
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
funding sources and the and the
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
breakdown of our over overall budget is
 
00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:42.350 align:start position:0%
breakdown of our over overall budget is
is

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.070 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
is uh listed there at the bottom overall
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
um about 40 federal funds uh 28 Highway
 
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
funds about 20 Turnpike funds 13 other
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
other interagency type of funds and
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
point two percent General funds so we
 
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:01.740 align:start position:0%
have very little
 
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.050 align:start position:0%
have very little
um

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:03.590 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
drawer on the general fund and uh you
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
know when you look at those two pieces
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the budget uh up there so the
 
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
municipal Aid and construction the
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
majority of that is the federal funding
 
00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:15.899 align:start position:0%
that goes in to support the construction
 
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
program on the operating side of the of
 
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
that half of the budget the majority of
 
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
that becomes the highway fund that
 
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.190 align:start position:0%
that becomes the highway fund that
supports

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
supports
 
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
um so with that
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
um and if there are any questions along
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
the way please stop and ask and we can
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
get it and
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sharon thank you for taking
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
my question now we've just gone through
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
um I've noticed that traffic is a lot
 
00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:45.410 align:start position:0%
um I've noticed that traffic is a lot
heavier

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
heavier
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
so just driving to Boston is awful now
 
00:11:52.009 --> 00:11:52.019 align:start position:0%
um how are things seeming because I know
 
00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:53.030 align:start position:0%
um how are things seeming because I know
when

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
um the former commissioner came in and
 
00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
testified she had talked about what we
 
00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
did well it was virtually
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
um what we didn't know was gonna if cars
 
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
were gonna come back the way they were
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
or we're going to work more virtually
 
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
what are you seeing
 
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
right um where we're still seeing that
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
even though traffic has rebounded
 
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
um it has not
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
um come back to pre-pandemic levels so
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
particularly on the turnpike system
 
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
um we monitor transactions and revenue
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
through through the um through the tolls
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
every day so we have a good history and
 
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
we've continued to compare
 
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
um traffic volumes to the pre-pandemic
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
levels and we've seen it kind of rebound
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
back but it's run still about
 
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh between seven and nine percent below
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
what it was in 2019.
 
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
um so it and that is a a little bit of
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
an impact on the revenue stream
 
00:12:57.889 --> 00:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
um in the in the turnpike fund and
 
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
that's you know mainly you know the
 
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
monitoring the the major highways you
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
know we have a permanent counter out on
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
I-93 and through the through the toll
 
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
plazas but it's pretty indicative I
 
00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
think of the overall travel travel
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:19.019 align:start position:0%
taking my questions there are two one of
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%
them is I just want to make sure I
 
00:13:22.009 --> 00:13:22.019 align:start position:0%
understand correctly when you say you're
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
responsible for the safety of the
 
00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:26.339 align:start position:0%
municipal Bridges I understand that to
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
mean that you're responsible for
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
inspecting them and deciding if they are
 
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
safe it's the municipalities that then
 
00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
have the burden of dealing with any
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
safety issues as needed am I
 
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
understanding that correctly yes that's
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
correct we do do the inspections and we
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
work with the towns if there are any
 
00:13:41.579 --> 00:13:43.069 align:start position:0%
work with the towns if there are any
deficiencies

00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
deficiencies
 
00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:44.030 align:start position:0%
deficiencies
um

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
so we we do all the inspections because
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
there is federal reporting for all
 
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
bridges and um for consistency's sake it
 
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
works out best having it come through
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
um through the state DOT so it's
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
consistent but we work if there are any
 
00:13:59.930 --> 00:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
uh deficiencies load postings things
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
like that we work with the
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
municipalities to see that it is um
 
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
addressed we do have uh a small amount
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
of of state aid toward um of course
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
Municipal Bridges
 
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with that again that kind
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
of goes with uh you know having been the
 
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
finance director of Windham we did have
 
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
a bridge that we had to get State
 
00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
financing and you know we've gone
 
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
through all that process but I just
 
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that I understand
 
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
the state level process I don't want to
 
00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:28.139 align:start position:0%
just look at it from a parochial point
 
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
of view and the 11 local public transit
 
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
systems can you give me idea of what our
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are towards them
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
because obviously I see the word local
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
and we are dealing with the state so I
 
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
just want to understand that balance
 
00:14:42.889 --> 00:14:42.899 align:start position:0%
between how is the state responsible for
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
what part of the local uh you know
 
00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459 align:start position:0%
public transit systems yeah the majority
 
00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:49.139 align:start position:0%
of our responsibility is the
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
administration of the of the funding so
 
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:54.300 align:start position:0%
we um we are the conduit for all of the
 
00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:56.300 align:start position:0%
Federal Transit um
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
Administration funding that goes to
 
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
support those
 
00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:04.019 align:start position:0%
local public transit agencies
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
um two things in the last round there
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
was some concern and it might have just
 
00:15:17.569 --> 00:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
been pandemic related of what or if you
 
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
were getting federally
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
um is idea either those still concerns
 
00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
do they still maintain or do you know
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
what you'll be getting from the federal
 
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
um yes yes well yes and no so uh I don't
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
I don't remember when the last uh
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
presentation and discussion was but um
 
00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:41.269 align:start position:0%
presentation and discussion was but um
before

00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:42.899 align:start position:0%
um there was a lot of uncertainty before
 
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
the um iija the federal infrastructure
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
Act was was passed it was a year-to-year
 
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
continuing resolution and things like
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
that so though that's great on
 
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
uncertainty with the passage
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
um last year of the federal
 
00:15:58.730 --> 00:15:58.740 align:start position:0%
infrastructure bill
 
00:16:01.189 --> 00:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
um it was also the reauthorization bill
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
so we have a look ahead for five years
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
of of our um
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
of our formula funding
 
00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:10.019 align:start position:0%
um that that comes to support the
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
highway program and I said yes and no
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
because as part of the infrastructure
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill in addition to the reauthorization
 
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
and our formula funding
 
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of uh competitive
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
discretionary Grant
 
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
um programs to go along and support
 
00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.370 align:start position:0%
um programs to go along and support
um

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:30.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
the overall infrastructure bill so
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
something like
 
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
you know 40 percent of the of the
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
funding of the money that that came with
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
that infrastructure bill
 
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
um is wrapped up in discretionary Grant
 
00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
programs some are discretionary Grant
 
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.210 align:start position:0%
programs some are discretionary Grant
programs

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
um that that the state agencies can can
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
participate to go after several of them
 
00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.970 align:start position:0%
participate to go after several of them
are

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:57.980 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:01.019 align:start position:0%
programs that only municipalities or
 
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
other constituencies can can seek um
 
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
funding so I say uh yes and no because
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantees for those they are
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
competitive you have to go through a
 
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
Grant application process we do try to
 
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
take advantage of of those but it is not
 
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
a not a not a guarantee
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
yeah my other question then so we've got
 
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
a number of new people here is it
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
possible now you may get to this later
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
on but is it um could you quickly go
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
through what funds can be used for what
 
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
and what funds can't be used for
 
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
specific things that's always one of the
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
things we're looking at with in the
 
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
budget of certain funds are only can be
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
used only for this I think we hit some
 
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
of that as we go through some of the
 
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:43.130 align:start position:0%
of that as we go through some of the
um

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
divisions in a little more detail so
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll head on hit on some of
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
that but as we get to the end if there
 
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539 align:start position:0%
are more questions we can make sure we
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
take them up sure
 
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
so if this is helpful I was going to ask
 
00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
Dave to go through a little bit more
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
detail on the divisions that he oversees
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
and I think he'll we will hit on some of
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
committee my name is David rodrigue and
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
I am the assistant commissioner for DOT
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
as well as the D.O.T chief engineer so
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
as Bill explained I'm responsible
 
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
primarily for two divisions in the D.O.T
 
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
the division of project development in
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
the division of operations the division
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
of project development includes several
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
bureaus work to together to plan design
 
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
advertise oversee the construction of
 
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
our transportation system they take care
 
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
of our our right-of-way
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
um and they help us make sure that we're
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
environmentally compliant as as well so
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
then are a number of bureaus we have our
 
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Highway design that includes
 
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
our project managers as well as a
 
00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:10.380 align:start position:0%
project design teams and a utilities
 
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.930 align:start position:0%
project design teams and a utilities
section

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
um that works as we design our projects
 
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220 align:start position:0%
to coordinate with different utilities
 
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh use our right-of-way to
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
um transmit power communication and and
 
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860 align:start position:0%
so forth we have our Bureau bridge
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
design that's responsible for Designing
 
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh bridges for doing projects to
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
preserve and maintain our bridges and
 
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
also for inspecting all of averages and
 
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
the municipal Bridges as as you had
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
pointed out our typical cycle is to
 
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
inspect the bridges every two years if
 
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
the bridges are on our red list which
 
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
means as Bill said they're structurally
 
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
deficient we look at those every six
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
months to make sure those continue to be
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
safe and we're on top of the condition
 
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
of those bridges because things can
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
change pretty quickly
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
um as they start to deteriorate we have
 
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
our Bureau of construction a bureau of
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
construction once projects are
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
advertised on a private contract
 
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.529 align:start position:0%
advertised on a private contract
typically

00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:15.539 align:start position:0%
typically
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
um is the one who's doing the work in
 
00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
our Bureau of construction oversees the
 
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
construction of the project they make
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
sure sure that the Project's built
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
according to plans they solve the
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
day-to-day issues that come up during a
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
construction project make sure the right
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
materials are used and and so forth we
 
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
have our Bureau of right-of-way who
 
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
purchases the land and the easements
 
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
that we need for our projects and also
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
keeps track of of what we already own
 
00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
and how we how we own that land in that
 
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:51.299 align:start position:0%
property we have our Bureau of
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
environment that helps us with the
 
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:57.059 align:start position:0%
permitting of all of our projects make
 
00:20:59.090 --> 00:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
sure as we construct them we're
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
constructing them in an environmentally
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
responsible way according to our permits
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
and then helps us on the operation side
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
as we're maintaining our infrastructure
 
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
to make sure we're doing that according
 
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
to environmental requirements as as well
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
um we have a bureau of planning and
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
Community Assistance that works with the
 
00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059 align:start position:0%
communities on municipally managed
 
00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
projects and oversees some of the
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
federal funds and state funds that flow
 
00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
to the communities and helps the
 
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
communities be successful in designing
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
advertising and constructing those
 
00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
projects themselves they also handle a
 
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
mapping a GIS layers and some other
 
00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:45.419 align:start position:0%
things as well and finally we have our
 
00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
Bureau of materials and research in
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
materials and research is involved in
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
making sure that we specify the right
 
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
materials in our construction projects
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
and then make sure that the contract is
 
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:02.820 align:start position:0%
contractor is delivering those materials
 
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
that meet the specifications so that we
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
we get what we're paying for in our
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
projects it's a complex system of a lot
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
of a lot of people that work together to
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
get the job done right
 
00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:17.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
um we've heard a lot of angst around
 
00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
construction of any kind
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
what are you experiencing are your costs
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
going up um due to the pandemic and
 
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
shoulders of supplies we hear it in
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
housing we hear it I know in my city
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
we're hearing about the increase overall
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
of costs of everything so what's the
 
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
impact on the state so Bill Bill will
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
touch on some of that later in the
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
presentation but I I would say off the
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
out off the the bat there's two major
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
things uh challenges we're facing in
 
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
that area right now the first is
 
00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:57.059 align:start position:0%
inflation and in addition to inflation
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
meaning costs have have increased
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
significantly that that we we also have
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
a challenge just getting things
 
00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:09.059 align:start position:0%
delivered so for the first time in in my
 
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
history on the operation side we we buy
 
00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
equipment and the legislature realizing
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
how how poor our equipment was has
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
really taken care of us and funded our
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
equipment budget in the last biennium
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
bottom line we order equipment we wait
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
for a vendor to deliver it they say
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
you'll have it in nine months nine
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
months passes and they cancel the PO and
 
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
say we can't deliver it for that cost
 
00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
previously to to before the pandemic
 
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
there was a list of people who wanted to
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
provide us equipment there was a list of
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
contractors who wanted to build job if
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
vendor a didn't deliver no problem
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
you're done we're going with them to be
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't work that way anymore today
 
00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:00.059 align:start position:0%
vendor B you go on their list and you
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
wait nine months for them and then they
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
may tell you that so we always like to
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
think that we have Choice
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
um we're seeing a a construction
 
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
atmosphere and a purchasing atmosphere
 
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
where we don't have the choice that we
 
00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
would like to have or the control that
 
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
we would like to have because we don't
 
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
always have those B and C bidders of
 
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:26.220 align:start position:0%
vendors to back it up so that's one
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
Challenge and the other challenge that
 
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
is really stock for us is being able to
 
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:34.580 align:start position:0%
hire people
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
we have significant vacancy rate rates
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
again what do we do when we have a
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates in the past we lean on our
 
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
engineering consultants and we lean on a
 
00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.930 align:start position:0%
engineering consultants and we lean on a
private

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
private
 
00:24:51.049 --> 00:24:51.059 align:start position:0%
um suppliers bottom line engineering
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
Consultants they're having a difficult
 
00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
time hiring people they are not staffed
 
00:24:59.330 --> 00:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
to deliver as we would like them to do
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
and contractors very much the same way
 
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
when we do a building
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
um project for one of our facilities the
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
building contract there's few bidders
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
Public Works Das can can fill you in on
 
00:25:18.409 --> 00:25:18.419 align:start position:0%
this but there's very few bidders and
 
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:22.919 align:start position:0%
um material delays very much the same
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
thing if you're waiting for a heating
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
system or or something
 
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
um you have to wait you may not get it
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
and the contractors are dealing with
 
00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
they put in a bid and then prices
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
increase during uh the life of the the
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
contracts particularly if it's a
 
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
multi-year contract so it's a long
 
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
answer but I hope I get to what you were
 
00:25:48.289 --> 00:25:48.299 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
being here and thank you for taking my
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
question uh levies how much involvement
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
do you have you got uh the kachiko which
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
runs underneath uh bridge on 153 and 75.
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
and we're having a tussle in our town
 
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
over that and I was wondering how much
 
00:26:09.409 --> 00:26:09.419 align:start position:0%
involvement and what uh what you could
 
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
do about it because it does affect your
 
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
Bridges if the the river bottom isn't
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
taken care of properly
 
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if Bill is is familiar
 
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
with that I think 75 and 153 I think
 
00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
you're talking about Farmington and the
 
00:26:30.169 --> 00:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
kachiko river and as that flows through
 
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
I'm not intimately familiar with the
 
00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
bridge or the situation that you're
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
describing I know either I I don't know
 
00:26:39.289 --> 00:26:39.299 align:start position:0%
if you mean like environmental
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
permitting or somebody that is reviewing
 
00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:43.340 align:start position:0%
and maintaining
 
00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
what they what they were doing is
 
00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:48.059 align:start position:0%
putting the uh putting a dozer in the
 
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
river and just grooming the you know the
 
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
stone and making sure there was enough
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh Stone in the sidewalls to make sure
 
00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't wash out
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%
and I guess we're having trouble I
 
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
didn't know how much the state would get
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
involved or a civil engineer they say
 
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
there's a levy there there's a levy to
 
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
protect the town because it's I mean
 
00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:11.460 align:start position:0%
it's called puddled off for a reason
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay and and that's and they said that
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
the levy is going down and but it but
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
they're having problems with putting a
 
00:27:21.649 --> 00:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
dozer in the river I mean which we've
 
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:23.940 align:start position:0%
done for 50 years that I can remember
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
right so I mean that's it maybe we can
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
talk about this later but it's it's I
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
was curious to find out how much you get
 
00:27:33.409 --> 00:27:33.419 align:start position:0%
involved with that sure not not very not
 
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
not not as much unless it does affect
 
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:37.740 align:start position:0%
our infrastructure we've worked with Des
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
on a couple of other similar projects
 
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
um not not similar but similar type of
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
issues we had a project
 
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
um uh where we had helped provide some
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
funding uh they did a river
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
stabilization on um I think it's a
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
suncooked South Cook River and an
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
evulsion that happened there it was
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
cutting back uh and uh somewhere down
 
00:28:00.529 --> 00:28:00.539 align:start position:0%
the line could have threatened the route
 
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
four Bridge so we had worked with them
 
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
we could get into a lot of detail we
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
could probably talk after but I think we
 
00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:12.299 align:start position:0%
we see
 
00:28:12.299 --> 00:28:13.250 align:start position:0%
we see
um

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
similar things like that as to whether
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
it be on the sea cow Seacoast or up
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
north things things that were done in in
 
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
the past uh in terms of getting in the
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
river and cleaning things out we see a
 
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
lot of aggregation
 
00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
um in in the Riverbanks and uh you know
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
30 40 years ago we would have you know
 
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
probably gone in and and moved that that
 
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
stuff back but um
 
00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:40.820 align:start position:0%
now it's much more letting the river
 
00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
river environment take its course and
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
and dealing with things that they come
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
up with it but
 
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I I so we we get
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
involved with it in similar type of
 
00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:54.539 align:start position:0%
things when it is a an issue for some of
 
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
our infrastructure but as far as the
 
00:28:59.090 --> 00:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
overall management of a levy or or River
 
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.710 align:start position:0%
overall management of a levy or or River
Bottom

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
Bottom
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
um that would probably working with the
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
with the like Environmental Services
 
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.029 align:start position:0%
with the like Environmental Services
sure

00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you can you give me some
 
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
guidance with regards to
 
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:13.730 align:start position:0%
guidance with regards to
um

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the red line Bridges
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
um in particular you know you know the
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
bridge I'm talking about but um yeah
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
where you've got bridges that are
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
redlined and why I'm bringing this up is
 
00:29:27.289 --> 00:29:27.299 align:start position:0%
because I've had a couple people
 
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
um in the area of construction come to
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
me to say that
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
um they know based on their personal
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
experience and knowledge that um trucks
 
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
are going over that little Bridge we
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
have a big construction project in
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
Newcastle it's a large residence that
 
00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:45.299 align:start position:0%
they're going over that bridge and they
 
00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
says you know because of their
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
experience with construction they know
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
they're over the limit and
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for check what can you
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
do it's not like y'all are out there you
 
00:29:57.289 --> 00:29:57.299 align:start position:0%
know checking that chief White is not
 
00:29:58.850 --> 00:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
standing on the bridge and even if he
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
were what's he going to do so is there
 
00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
any mechanism for enforcement of what
 
00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
happens when you've got you know a red
 
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
line bridge that is you know in serious
 
00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
shape and you've got trucks going over
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
it that are well over the limit
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
um I was just trying to come up with
 
00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:16.020 align:start position:0%
scenarios and it's like you wait until
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
the bridge falls down and then give them
 
00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
a fine so can you just talk give me a
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
narrative about how you deal with that
 
00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:24.059 align:start position:0%
sort of a problem
 
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'll I'll let Dave uh chime in
 
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
a little bit more but but essentially
 
00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:29.870 align:start position:0%
a little bit more but but essentially
um

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
you know we we look at the structural
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
condition and we we post it and and I I
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
would say you know we always want to be
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
safe and I'm sure from an engineering
 
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
perspective there are factors of safety
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
in in those in those postings
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
um we have had similar examples
 
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
um where we
 
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.230 align:start position:0%
um where we
um

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
have had stronger concern and have had
 
00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
targeted enforcement around certain
 
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
Bridge postings and things like that at
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
the end of the day it is the Department
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
of Safety State Police that has a um
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh weight enforcement unit
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
and that's that's for you know that's
 
00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
for all legal loads as well to not
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily just the the posted Bridges
 
00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:13.860 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
um you know legal loads on all all
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
um on all roads and stuff and seeing
 
00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
that trucks and things that are
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
um Meeting those legal loads I don't
 
00:31:24.289 --> 00:31:24.299 align:start position:0%
know Dave if you've worked closer with
 
00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety Troop G dude I I
 
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
would just add first of all thank you
 
00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
for your concern because we share your
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
your concern an overloaded trucks do two
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
types of damage to the bridge obviously
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
the worst type of of damage is a bridge
 
00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:44.700 align:start position:0%
failure that that we can never never see
 
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
and we do everything we we can to
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
protect against that but short of a
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
bridge failure overloaded trucks have an
 
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.230 align:start position:0%
bridge failure overloaded trucks have an
incremental

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
incremental
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
um degradation of the condition of the
 
00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
bridge so they may not make it fall down
 
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
but as they travel over it the cracks
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
get a little bigger they get a little
 
00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
deeper the deflections are a little
 
00:32:12.409 --> 00:32:12.419 align:start position:0%
further and a little more frequent and
 
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
they they accelerate rate the end of the
 
00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
life of that that bridge one of the
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
reasons why for red listed Bridges we
 
00:32:21.409 --> 00:32:21.419 align:start position:0%
look at them every six months to make
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
sure that we catch those things when it
 
00:32:27.769 --> 00:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
comes to enforcement there there are
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
very specific laws about legal loads and
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
what is legal to go over the road in
 
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
Troop G
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
um from State Police is responsible to
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
enforce those with of course limited
 
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
resources and they can't be everywhere
 
00:32:45.649 --> 00:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
all the time people ask me about the
 
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:46.980 align:start position:0%
bridge I said well when you go over the
 
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
so if you'd like uh oh I'm just gonna
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
ask Miss chair I I want to be sensitive
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
to time we can we can jump jump to some
 
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
specific items of Interest here or or
 
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
keep going it's up to you okay very good
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
then uh Dave continue thanks all right
 
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
very good so just wrapping up with the
 
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:17.820 align:start position:0%
project Development Division
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
um well they do all those individual
 
00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
pieces one of their primary
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is preparing and
 
00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:27.539 align:start position:0%
delivering the state's 10-year
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation Improvement plan and that
 
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
that 10-year plan is updated every two
 
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
years through a very formal process
 
00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.710 align:start position:0%
years through a very formal process
where

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
um the gasset and the the dot will work
 
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
with the the gasic committee the
 
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.350 align:start position:0%
with the the gasic committee the
governors

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
governors
 
00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
um executive counselors and go around to
 
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
communities and have public hearing
 
00:33:57.409 --> 00:33:57.419 align:start position:0%
things on what's in the 10-year plan and
 
00:33:59.649 --> 00:33:59.659 align:start position:0%
take input into
 
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
what the communities in the regional
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
planning commissions would like to see
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
added to the 10-year plan and shift it
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
the word of caution that that goes along
 
00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
with that is
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to be in the 10-year
 
00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
plan the 10-year plan is fiscally
 
00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
constrained there is not an unlimited
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
pot of money so projects coming into the
 
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
10-year plan typically push other
 
00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
projects out of the 10-year plan we
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
talked about inflation and part of our
 
00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:35.300 align:start position:0%
new federal
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure legislation has provided
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
some increased funds that have helped us
 
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
to be able to to continue with projects
 
00:34:48.589 --> 00:34:48.599 align:start position:0%
that are in the plan and paid the
 
00:34:50.329 --> 00:34:50.339 align:start position:0%
difference for some of that inflation
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't leave a lot of extra
 
00:34:57.310 --> 00:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
funds to to add additional projects
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
especially right now we the department
 
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
really rely on the regional planning
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
commissions to listen to the communities
 
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
and help us prioritize those Regional
 
00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
needs and then of course the counselors
 
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the day the 10-year
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
plan we prepare a recommended 10-year
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
plan that then Works its way through the
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
legislature for approval and finally
 
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
goes to to the governor's desk for
 
00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
approval the big caution on that process
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
again is it is fiscally constrained so
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
things that come in and move up
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
typically bump things out
 
00:35:41.569 --> 00:35:41.579 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you you keep
 
00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
mentioning inflation what do you see as
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
inflation rate roughly uh
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing in your new projects
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
and whatever right
 
00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
I I can get you that number we have a a
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
very specific inflation rate that is is
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
computed through our Bureau of
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
construction folks and I don't have that
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
with me Bill I don't know somewhat
 
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.750 align:start position:0%
with me Bill I don't know somewhat
anecdotally

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
anecdotally
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
um you know uh at the end of um
 
00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
at the end of last season you know
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
through through the spring and summer
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's gas prices and everything's went
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
up we certainly saw
 
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.450 align:start position:0%
up we certainly saw
um

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
you know bid prices on contracts
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
um exceeding our our estimates by
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
um you know fifteen twenty percent so
 
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
that was kind of the running inflation
 
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.910 align:start position:0%
that was kind of the running inflation
rate

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
um again a little anecdotally we have
 
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:33.660 align:start position:0%
more more detail I know and we will be
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
looking at it as a question as we look
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
at the update of the 10-year plan how
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
um conservative or realistic or uh you
 
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
know how conservative we want to be in
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
projecting escalation for all those
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
future future projects but yeah we were
 
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.750 align:start position:0%
future future projects but yeah we were
seeing

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
um you know 20 or so
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
um increases in in construction costs uh
 
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
through last year I know when we've kind
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
of looked at looked at it over a little
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
bit longer period of time we do a um we
 
00:37:08.329 --> 00:37:08.339 align:start position:0%
do a monitoring with the construction
 
00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
costs index and going back to
 
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
um about three years right right around
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
the time of the pandemic and looking at
 
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:17.579 align:start position:0%
that longer period we've been seeing
 
00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
around on 11
 
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.930 align:start position:0%
around on 11
um

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.069 align:start position:0%
um
um

00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
growth in the construction costs index
 
00:37:24.119 --> 00:37:25.310 align:start position:0%
growth in the construction costs index
so

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
whether it continues to know at those of
 
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
the economic forecasts that we have to
 
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.890 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just a quick
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up to what you were just saying
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
do you have any color around how much of
 
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
that Spike was due to perceived risk and
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
how much was actual inflation because
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
obviously you know when the pandemic
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
started it wasn't clear if you could get
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
anything done and people had to hike up
 
00:37:59.930 --> 00:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
the price because they were not sure if
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
they can get the materials and they were
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
adding a risk premium to the contract do
 
00:38:08.089 --> 00:38:08.099 align:start position:0%
you have any unders any any color to add
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
to how much of that may have been you
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
know a risk premium versus an actual
 
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
increase in the supplies and actual
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
costs I know it's a tough question I'm
 
00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
just looking for anything you may have I
 
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
I I yeah I really don't I I don't the
 
00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:26.339 align:start position:0%
one thing I I will say you know on on we
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
did see more of that risk based
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
um cost increase over longer term
 
00:38:34.849 --> 00:38:34.859 align:start position:0%
contracts so if we had a if we had a one
 
00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
season contract
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
um you know for a Paving project or
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
something like that I think the
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
inflation there was was was strictly in
 
00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
inflation when we saw some of those
 
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
higher costs on a on a multi-year
 
00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
contract I know from the feedback I
 
00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
heard from the contractors the labor
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
market and some of that uncertainty
 
00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:56.900 align:start position:0%
which I think gets to your um
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
risk was was factored in there but I
 
00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
don't have a I don't have a sense of I
 
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and I know that it's a
 
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
really tough question but again any
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
information is useful so I appreciate
 
00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
what you are able to provide thank you
 
00:39:14.329 --> 00:39:14.339 align:start position:0%
and I would add a little bit more color
 
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
to that the the work that we do is very
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
fuel intensive and very steel steel
 
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
intensive so you look at the price of
 
00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:26.339 align:start position:0%
fuel you look at the price of steel you
 
00:39:28.849 --> 00:39:28.859 align:start position:0%
look at the price of Labor and you get
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
an idea of really what drives a lot of
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
um a little a little bit more
 
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.370 align:start position:0%
um a little a little bit more
information

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
um on a 10-year plan we we deliver about
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
225 million dollars worth of federal
 
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.569 align:start position:0%
225 million dollars worth of federal
projects

00:39:50.569 --> 00:39:50.579 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
um each year the 10-year plan projects
 
00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:55.619 align:start position:0%
are primarily federally funded there are
 
00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
some some programmatic State funds and
 
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
and there as well
 
00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
um and a few other state funds in fiscal
 
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:07.220 align:start position:0%
year 22 we added 57 new construction
 
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
contracts in Iberia construction
 
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
provided oversight on 84 active
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
construction projects with a combined
 
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
total value of 750 million dollars worth
 
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
of work that they were overseeing and
 
00:40:28.609 --> 00:40:28.619 align:start position:0%
um also in 22 we advertised 233 million
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of contracts
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
so that's the division of project
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
development shifting over to the
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
includes

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
includes
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
um several bureaus that oversee the
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
operations and maintenance of our
 
00:40:52.609 --> 00:40:52.619 align:start position:0%
transportation system so they're the
 
00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
ones who uh plow in the snow fixing the
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
bridges washing the the bridges
 
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
maintaining the bridges and so forth so
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
I'll walk through quickly each of of
 
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
those bureaus we have the Bureau of
 
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance which is our largest
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
Bureau in operations and they have
 
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
spread around the state we have six
 
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance districts and we
 
00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
have 87 Patrol sheds around the state
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
that are responsible for the roads
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
within their sections I always want to
 
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
explain 87 Patrol sections sounds like a
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
lot but when you think of of New
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the number of towns and
 
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
and cities we have winds up to one
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
Patrol section covering about two and a
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
half to two and three quarter towns in
 
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:45.780 align:start position:0%
these these crews are made up of five to
 
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
to 12 people for some of our crews the
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
larger crews are the ones that take care
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
of our interstate system so it's really
 
00:41:56.569 --> 00:41:56.579 align:start position:0%
not a lot when you think of five or six
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
people taking care of all the state
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
roads and two and a half or or so towns
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
um Highway Maintenance maintains uh the
 
00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
the roads does the snow plow operations
 
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
they're the ones when we have
 
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
emergencies that you see out there
 
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
working 24 hours a day seven days a week
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
to get those roads opened back up just
 
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
as quick as possible so Emergency
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
Services can get to people and so that
 
00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:29.579 align:start position:0%
um life can return to normal for folks
 
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
um they also manage our driveway
 
00:42:35.569 --> 00:42:35.579 align:start position:0%
permitting process so if a business or a
 
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
homeowner wants to construct a new
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
driveway onto a state road they get a
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
permit through a Highway Maintenance
 
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
districts and part of that permit
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
process is to make sure that that
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
driveway is is safe and not that
 
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
driveway doesn't
 
00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
um deteriorate the the efficiency and
 
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
the capacity of the roadway
 
00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
um Beyond what's reasonable if it hasn't
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
impacts they work with the developers to
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
mitigate those those impacts
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
operations also includes the Bureau of
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
traffic traffic is responsible for a
 
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
roadway line striping for taking care of
 
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
our signs and traffic signals they're
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
also responsible for setting speed
 
00:43:26.809 --> 00:43:26.819 align:start position:0%
limits interesting thing about Bureau of
 
00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
traffic and when we talk about pavement
 
00:43:32.569 --> 00:43:32.579 align:start position:0%
markings and speed limits
 
00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:35.339 align:start position:0%
um so pavement markings it's passing
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
zones speed limits it's how high or low
 
00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.190 align:start position:0%
zones speed limits it's how high or low
um

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:44.329 --> 00:43:44.339 align:start position:0%
one one way of looking how those issues
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
come up one way to explain it is most
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
people want the passing zone closed and
 
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
the speed limit lowered in front of
 
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
their home or property but everywhere
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
else they drive they want the speed
 
00:43:58.849 --> 00:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
limit higher and they want as many
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
passing opportunities as as we can get
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
so there is a lot of tension in that
 
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
Bureau as as they work to take care of
 
00:44:13.849 --> 00:44:13.859 align:start position:0%
um both the the local people's needs but
 
00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:16.220 align:start position:0%
as as the state DOT a real
 
00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to make sure that
 
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
everybody's Transportation Needs A
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
Satisfied and that includes folks who
 
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
need to to get from the southern part of
 
00:44:29.329 --> 00:44:29.339 align:start position:0%
our state to the northern part of the
 
00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
state or the east to west and they can't
 
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:35.099 align:start position:0%
do that efficiently at 30 or 25 or 20
 
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
miles an hour the whole way so a little
 
00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:40.140 align:start position:0%
bit of tension then Bridgeman
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
maintenance we have 12 Bridge
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
maintenance Crews Bridge maintenance one
 
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%
of those Crews takes care of the
 
00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:50.099 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and Newcastle with Bridges
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
and and so forth
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and also the crews Statewide
 
00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
um do bridge maintenance they do bridge
 
00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
preservation projects
 
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and help to to keep those bridges
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
serviceable they also respond to
 
00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
emergencies and help things going we've
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work on Asset Management
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
um over the last 10 plus plus years and
 
00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
one of the things we've we've really
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
learned is maintenance and preservation
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
is the cheapest way to drive a a low
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
asset life cycle when it comes to
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
bridges that means washing the salt off
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
the bridges in the spring we still don't
 
00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
get to do that to every bridge every
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
year although we try those local cost
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
things that require people in labor pay
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
off in the long run they're very
 
00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
difficult when you're trying to manage
 
00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
that bottom line of the budget every
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
we have our Bureau of Mechanical
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
Services we have a Statewide garage here
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
and and Concord state-of-the-art
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
facility and we have six
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
um garages around the state a mechanical
 
00:46:09.170 --> 00:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
fleet has a replacement value of about
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
110 million dollars very significant if
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
you think an average piece of equipment
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
lasts 10 years you do the math we should
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
be putting in 11 million dollars a year
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
to keep that going and that Fleet is
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
primarily not exclusively but primarily
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
the plow trucks and the spreaders and
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
the plow trucks and so forth that you
 
00:46:36.050 --> 00:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
see out there on the road during the
 
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.550 align:start position:0%
see out there on the road during the
winter

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
winter
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
we have a fuel distribution section a
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
field distribution folks have 92 sites
 
00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
across the state for that that provides
 
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
fuel for State local and some non-profit
 
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.930 align:start position:0%
fuel for State local and some non-profit
groups

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
groups
 
00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
um to purchase fuel 24 7 at those
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
facilities we also have our Bureau of
 
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
Transportation Systems management and
 
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:05.089 align:start position:0%
Transportation Systems management and
operations

00:47:05.089 --> 00:47:05.099 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
um that's a an evolving field
 
00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
um and that is all about making sure
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
that we help let drivers know what's
 
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
going on on the roadway Network so that
 
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
they can make decisions that that are
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
best for them so tismo they control the
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
the cameras they controlled the message
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
boards that are out there our road
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
weather information systems and they
 
00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
have traveler Information Systems as
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
well that that provide people
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
information that helps us with
 
00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
efficiency it's also a huge help when it
 
00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
comes to safety so if an accident for
 
00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
instance if an accident occurs on an
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
interstate and traffic starts to to back
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
up studies show as that cue backs up
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
secondary accidents often occur and are
 
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
often sometimes worse than the initial
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
incident so having first of all being
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
able to recognize that there's an
 
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
accident there quickly and then provide
 
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
motorists approaching that that accident
 
00:48:14.829 --> 00:48:14.839 align:start position:0%
the information that the stop Traffic
 
00:48:19.309 --> 00:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
Ahead makes for a safer Network and when
 
00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
we provide that with delay information
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
it also helps people choose other routes
 
00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
so they don't miss their flight or their
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
important appointment
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
what's up
 
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair first I didn't write
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
down the original the names when I uh
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
you know you guys introduced yourselves
 
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
and I noticed that the website has the
 
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the deputy
 
00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
Commissioners names but you are
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
Anonymous would you be able to just tell
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
me your name one more time it's like
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
um I was appointed and confirmed in
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
December so I'm it's nothing against me
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
I'll be there I don't want to get to the
 
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
department politics you know it's all
 
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
good but just a quick clarification a
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
couple of clarification questions you
 
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
said six garages the handout says seven
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
I just don't know which number is I'm
 
00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
sorry we have the Central Garage in
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
Concord and then we have six uh around
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
the satellite thank you and you were
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
saying that the fleet uh you know is has
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
about the 10-year life cycle is that
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
what you see operationally or is that
 
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
more of a accounting uh you know
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
depreciation schedule that we use can
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
you comment on what how what life do you
 
00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
get out of the you know say plow drugs
 
00:49:35.569 --> 00:49:35.579 align:start position:0%
which obviously have a lot of views yes
 
00:49:35.579 --> 00:49:37.250 align:start position:0%
which obviously have a lot of views yes
so

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
average we use that or I use that number
 
00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
of 10 years for simple math to to get
 
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
the investment
 
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
um cars have a a useful life of five or
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
six years or 150 000 miles
 
00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
um a lot of our trucks have a projected
 
00:49:59.510 --> 00:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
life of 20 12 years
 
00:50:03.530 --> 00:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
um or again uh about 150
 
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
000 miles we also have our parameters
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
that go on that
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
um those life cycles include selling
 
00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
that asset when there's still a value to
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
it and then putting that money back into
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
the the fleet so we actually they're
 
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
they're a state dots that turn over
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
their vehicles every two years and they
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
find that to be most efficient
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
um because they sell them while they're
 
00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
still value in them
 
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
um when New Hampshire we're never going
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
to to turn over our vehicles every every
 
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
two years but we do need to to
 
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
um turn them over at the thresholds that
 
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
we check set to be more efficient that
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
being said there's always a good
 
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
percentage of the fleet that's beyond
 
00:50:56.569 --> 00:50:56.579 align:start position:0%
those those parameters thank you I
 
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and really it's new
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
information and it's very good and the
 
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
last question is it does it's not a huge
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
question but frankly I was just going to
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
say that when we talk about you know
 
00:51:08.329 --> 00:51:08.339 align:start position:0%
anticipating an accident and traffic and
 
00:51:11.329 --> 00:51:11.339 align:start position:0%
whatnot personally I use Waze and it
 
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
does a darn good job of telling me
 
00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
what's ahead and uh you know are we
 
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
working in any way with such apps I'm
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
not I don't want to focus on one of them
 
00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:23.339 align:start position:0%
but on those types of apps is there any
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
effort to integrate or feed data or you
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
know pull data from them and try to
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
benefit from some of the free work
 
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:31.380 align:start position:0%
because Waze makes a living by getting
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
users to do all the work of providing
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
that information and just Aggregates it
 
00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
is that something we're trying to take
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
advantage of one way or the other
 
00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
we do we integrate with ways so there
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
there's a couple parts of of traveler
 
00:51:50.089 --> 00:51:50.099 align:start position:0%
information one is determining when and
 
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
where an incident occurs the other is
 
00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
processing what actually is happening
 
00:51:57.770 --> 00:51:57.780 align:start position:0%
and then the third is what's the right
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
information dissemination to the public
 
00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
so with an app-like ways our system
 
00:52:07.069 --> 00:52:07.079 align:start position:0%
actually sends them information that we
 
00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:09.980 align:start position:0%
have in that traveler information system
 
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
not only provides information that we
 
00:52:17.329 --> 00:52:17.339 align:start position:0%
learn ourselves it also allows the users
 
00:52:21.309 --> 00:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
to click a a box in to show the ways
 
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
incidents on that travel or information
 
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
the uh are you having trouble finding
 
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
contractors for snow plowing and things
 
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
like that and the cost I mean to stay
 
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:41.940 align:start position:0%
within you know your it's hard to stay
 
00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
within a budget when you get a 20
 
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
inflation and also for the bridge
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
construction I noticed you pulled one of
 
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:51.660 align:start position:0%
your rfps for uh 93 I believe
 
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
Londonderry because you couldn't get a
 
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
bid which was within uh what you
 
00:52:58.609 --> 00:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
expected to pay
 
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
right so
 
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
all right so so your first question I'm
 
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
sorry final plow drivers yeah plow
 
00:53:10.309 --> 00:53:10.319 align:start position:0%
drivers yes
 
00:53:10.319 --> 00:53:11.530 align:start position:0%
drivers yes
yes

00:53:11.530 --> 00:53:11.540 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
we absolutely are so we have a long
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
history of using contract rental plow
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
drivers so we have the ability through
 
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
through the laws and the rules that of
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services to
 
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
sign up by the hour plow trucks with
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
with operators
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
um we've done quite well with that over
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
the years and in fact when we're staffed
 
00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
right we're about 60 percent contract
 
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
plow drivers and about 40 percent dot
 
00:53:50.089 --> 00:53:50.099 align:start position:0%
plow drivers and trucks recent years we
 
00:53:53.809 --> 00:53:53.819 align:start position:0%
are much closer to 50 50 where it's 50
 
00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
percent Dot and 50 contract plow drivers
 
00:54:02.569 --> 00:54:02.579 align:start position:0%
for several reasons the the first is a
 
00:54:04.849 --> 00:54:04.859 align:start position:0%
lot of those plow drivers used to get
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
our old trucks when we turned them over
 
00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
regularly and for for years we under
 
00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
invested and roughly and then we took
 
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
advantage of Volkswagen funds which was
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
great to help us at least get a couple
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
trucks but we had to to destroy those
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
trucks so they did not feed that market
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's one issue the the second
 
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
issue is we plow with one shift so when
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
that storm starts not before when it
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
starts we call our cruise in to begin to
 
00:54:41.569 --> 00:54:41.579 align:start position:0%
plow the snow that same crew is there
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
till the storm ends and we go around and
 
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
clean up our
 
00:54:50.030 --> 00:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
um contract rental trucks are an
 
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
important part of the people who need to
 
00:54:55.250 --> 00:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
be with us from start to finish the
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
truth is there's fewer and fewer people
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
who want to to do that today and who can
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
structure their lives so that they they
 
00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:07.380 align:start position:0%
can do that today and then finally they
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
they face the same pressures we do with
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
with the labor market and we have owners
 
00:55:17.089 --> 00:55:17.099 align:start position:0%
tell us we have three or four trucks I
 
00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
can only put one on because I only have
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
one one driver
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
um so if I had more drivers I'd put
 
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
three or four more trucks on with you
 
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
but they they can't so it is much more
 
00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:32.270 align:start position:0%
but they they can't so it is much more
difficult

00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
what yeah what was the question of
 
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:41.510 align:start position:0%
what yeah what was the question of
Londonderry

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:43.079 --> 00:55:46.370 align:start position:0%
thank you
sure

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
um I I can only say that it's it's um
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's gotten thinner you know where and
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh and part of that is the labor market
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
or the or the or the inflation or or
 
00:55:59.210 --> 00:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
things like that so you know we would
 
00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
hope to typically get five six seven
 
00:56:05.809 --> 00:56:05.819 align:start position:0%
seven bidders on on projects we consider
 
00:56:07.609 --> 00:56:07.619 align:start position:0%
it good if we get two or two or three
 
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
for the competition we have we have had
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
a couple of projects that we have not
 
00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:15.059 align:start position:0%
got any any bids on
 
00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:17.900 align:start position:0%
um I can't I can't honestly remember
 
00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
what the Londonderry project was but I
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
think those are outliers by and large
 
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
um typically when we have a situation
 
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
like that we'll look at the project and
 
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
look at the
 
00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh you know if the work is clear if the
 
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
if the schedule is too um too demanding
 
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
or get some feedback from the industry
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
why they didn't bid on it what they saw
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
in the package in the construction
 
00:56:44.809 --> 00:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
requirement to make some adjustments and
 
00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
re-advertise it
 
00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
so I don't that answers answers your
 
00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:49.670 align:start position:0%
so I don't that answers answers your
question

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
the very few and far between that that
 
00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
we don't get uh
 
00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
um interest or that we don't have
 
00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:01.140 align:start position:0%
bidders on our projects yeah
 
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
um I think you went through this quickly
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure if I caught it
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
correctly or not
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
um when you're talking about uh you know
 
00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:11.339 align:start position:0%
we had worked to put money
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
um for equipment you know for cars to
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
try to get back on track and how much
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
you would need and scoping it out are
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
you there yet are you not there yet uh
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
where because I think there's been
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
Improvement but um are you in that cycle
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
that you want to be in where you can
 
00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
turn over the cars of fish or plows and
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
trucks and all in the way that you want
 
00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
to and get into a sustainable kind of a
 
00:57:32.819 --> 00:57:34.549 align:start position:0%
to and get into a sustainable kind of a
cycle

00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
I think we have approached it that had
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
always been a backlog but again the
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
recent um the recent budgets and as Dave
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
pointed out one of the difficulties in
 
00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579 align:start position:0%
the last year has been while we've had
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
the resources financially we have not
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
been able to you know get the the
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
purchase orders filled because of um you
 
00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
know delays in the manufacturing side
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
and things like that
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
um but I mean the key thing that that
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
you asked representative Murray was
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
about sustainability so we have I feel
 
00:58:07.609 --> 00:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
like we've kind of harped on this at
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
several budgets the last time because we
 
00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
did fall so far behind and Dave talked
 
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
about the 10 the 10-year life because of
 
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
easy math but um you know very simply if
 
00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
if if we have a fleet that's valued at
 
00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
around 90 million dollars and it should
 
00:58:27.049 --> 00:58:27.059 align:start position:0%
be replaced every every 10 years or so
 
00:58:28.609 --> 00:58:28.619 align:start position:0%
we should be investing about nine
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year in in that in
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
that Fleet and in the last few years
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
through through some capital budget
 
00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:38.540 align:start position:0%
Appropriations as well as
 
00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:41.819 align:start position:0%
you know budget Appropriations we have
 
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
worked to reduce the the backlog
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
the sustainability part is the difficult
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
thing we'll see coming up in this budget
 
00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
whether whether that those those that
 
00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
you know nine nine to ten million
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
dollars a year of sustained investment
 
00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
to keep on top of that
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
um will be supported or not
 
00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.990 align:start position:0%
um will be supported or not
but

00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
go a little bit further with that
 
00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.410 align:start position:0%
go a little bit further with that
um

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
because it's so hard to get trucks and
 
00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:11.270 align:start position:0%
because it's so hard to get trucks and
construction

00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:59:14.089 --> 00:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
um do you have are you going to be
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
surplusing a lot of money from your
 
00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.059 align:start position:0%
budget this year
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
of this session of this pass by your
 
00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.530 align:start position:0%
of this session of this pass by your
name

00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
name
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know we'll have to we'll have
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
to look at that and and and and see
 
00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
um ideally I ideally uh and I I'm not
 
00:59:33.289 --> 00:59:33.299 align:start position:0%
sure if some of those so we have power
 
00:59:35.809 --> 00:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
we have purchase orders we have money
 
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
encumbered it's not spent I believe an
 
00:59:42.049 --> 00:59:42.059 align:start position:0%
optic in more detail after if we have it
 
00:59:43.849 --> 00:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
encumbered like that it would stay in
 
00:59:43.859 --> 00:59:44.950 align:start position:0%
encumbered like that it would stay in
Balance

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
Balance
 
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
things like that right
 
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
um but with that said we do have a
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
number of vacancies we have historically
 
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:54.059 align:start position:0%
High vacancy rates and in past years we
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
have had
 
00:59:58.250 --> 00:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
um higher higher lapses than than we
 
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
have um than we have projected so thank
 
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
you every time there's a snowstorm since
 
01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:06.140 align:start position:0%
I've been on this committee I now worry
 
01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:08.460 align:start position:0%
if the streets are going to get plowed
 
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
the highway they will get plowed they'll
 
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
definitely get plowed you know but it
 
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
may take a little a little longer to to
 
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
to you know clean it up but they will
 
01:00:20.569 --> 01:00:20.579 align:start position:0%
get blocked working hard for you thank
 
01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to follow
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
up to representative Murray's question
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
about you know the um
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
whether you are caught up with a fleet
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
equipment and whatnot and I heard you
 
01:00:35.329 --> 01:00:35.339 align:start position:0%
say that you know more funding might be
 
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
needed I'm just trying to understand
 
01:00:39.049 --> 01:00:39.059 align:start position:0%
because the way I look at it if the
 
01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:41.819 align:start position:0%
department is employing an optimal you
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
know strategy and handling equipment
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
that should keep costs to a reasonably
 
01:00:48.049 --> 01:00:48.059 align:start position:0%
low level now of course if the
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
department ends up underfunded and has
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
to step out of that schedule there may
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
be an initial increase in costs to get
 
01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
back on the schedule but I would expect
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
the final outcome to be looking for a
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
lower overall you know Fleet Maintenance
 
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
budget and otherwise am I understanding
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
this correctly again I'm new here and I
 
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
wasn't here the previous year so I'm
 
01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
liking a lot of context I just want to
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
make sure I don't misunderstand
 
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
something that was said
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
yes I think you understand it correctly
 
01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
like I said in in the past years you
 
01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:16.730 align:start position:0%
like I said in in the past years you
know

01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
um you know we have historical data on
 
01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:21.020 align:start position:0%
on the budgets where we 've been
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
advocating and saying that we should be
 
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
spending about eight or nine million
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in in Fleet Investments
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
there are a number of years where we had
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
budget lines of two or three million
 
01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
dollars so we we did what we could with
 
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
that and the fleet got older and um you
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
know we had a
 
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
um a backlog of of of Maintenance needs
 
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
and it becomes a point of diminishing
 
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
returns if you're if you're spending a
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
lot of money to keep
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
um old outdated equipment running and
 
01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
and and and and uh and and on the road
 
01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.170 align:start position:0%
and and and and uh and and on the road
um

01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:59.450 --> 01:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
that that that's why when we do we do
 
01:02:01.789 --> 01:02:01.799 align:start position:0%
strive for that optimal
 
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
um you know getting as much life out of
 
01:02:06.289 --> 01:02:06.299 align:start position:0%
out of our Fleet and Equipment as as
 
01:02:06.299 --> 01:02:08.030 align:start position:0%
out of our Fleet and Equipment as as
possible

01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
um but also seeking to replace it when
 
01:02:11.569 --> 01:02:11.579 align:start position:0%
it becomes
 
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
um very outdated or very expensive to
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
continue to maintain it okay just a
 
01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:17.900 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up very quick very quick
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
got it I will wave the follow-up thank
 
01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.329 align:start position:0%
got it I will wave the follow-up thank
you

01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:23.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:27.289 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:27.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.299 --> 01:02:29.829 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
but in the verticals construction
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
industry there's a company called RS
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
means that publishes construction data
 
01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
is in the horizontal world you live in
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
is is there an RS means type company
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
that gives you here's what it costs to
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
do this in different parts of the
 
01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
country yes yeah and there are several
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
there are several there are several of
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
those um indices that we follow and
 
01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:53.579 align:start position:0%
stuff right yeah
 
01:02:53.579 --> 01:02:55.270 align:start position:0%
stuff right yeah
right

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:02:58.970 --> 01:02:58.980 align:start position:0%
I will pick it up my myself the last the
 
01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
last Bureau to touch on
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
um is a Turnpike Bureau uh turnpike's
 
01:03:08.329 --> 01:03:08.339 align:start position:0%
comprised of three different segments we
 
01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
um I-95 from Mass to Maine we have the
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
Spalding turnpike from Portsmouth to to
 
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
Milton and we have the the central
 
01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
turnpike from Nashua to Concord
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
um 89 miles long 172 Bridges seven toll
 
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:31.140 align:start position:0%
facilities the important thing about our
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
Turnpike system is it is an Enterprise
 
01:03:37.549 --> 01:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
fund that means the tolls that we
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
collect on the turnpike stay on the
 
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
turnpike and cannot be used for for
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
other purposes the other thing is we
 
01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.349 align:start position:0%
other purposes the other thing is we
have

01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
um needs on the turnpike that include
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
president preservation and and
 
01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
maintenance replacement
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and some minor expansion at some
 
01:04:04.089 --> 01:04:04.099 align:start position:0%
times those tools that we collect today
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
fund all of those things is people
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes think oh the tools were just
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to be until we paid for the
 
01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
transportation the the roadway you know
 
01:04:18.049 --> 01:04:18.059 align:start position:0%
the tolls continue to operate and
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
maintain the roadway not just the the
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
initial construction costs
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
um so again Turnpike Revenue pays for
 
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
operating and maintenance it pays for
 
01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:30.299 align:start position:0%
our debt service for our bonds that
 
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
we've used for construction projects our
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
renewal and replacement work as well as
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
our Capital Improvements in fiscal year
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
22 we had 112 million transactions on
 
01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:46.980 align:start position:0%
the turnpike system and generated a
 
01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
revenue of about 123 million dollars
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
and with that I just um step in here for
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
one minute because it gets to a question
 
01:04:58.789 --> 01:04:58.799 align:start position:0%
that representative Murray asked about
 
01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
about the colors of money and what can
 
01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
be used on on what so this is the
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
turnpike system is a very good example
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh as Dave said it's an Enterprise
 
01:05:10.609 --> 01:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
System uh the toll Revenue can only be
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
used on on those those those roads so
 
01:05:16.190 --> 01:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
um sometimes in the budget or the
 
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
10-year plan we talk about Turnpike
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
capital projects when we're talking
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
about major Bridge projects or or um or
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
the widening we have completed recently
 
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
in Newington and Dover so those are you
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
know Turnpike funded it doesn't it
 
01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh we don't use the federal
 
01:05:36.289 --> 01:05:36.299 align:start position:0%
funds or things like that uh it's just
 
01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:37.490 align:start position:0%
funds or things like that uh it's just
solely

01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
solely
 
01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.410 align:start position:0%
solely
um

01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:38.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
supported by the by the toll Revenue
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
um David talked a little bit about the
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
federal funds and the construction
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
program that's primarily the highway and
 
01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
bridge program about 220 223 million
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
dollars a year and again those are those
 
01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
are funds that that can only be used on
 
01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
on federal aid eligible highways so in
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have about one-third of
 
01:06:08.170 --> 01:06:08.180 align:start position:0%
our roadway mileage a lot of the
 
01:06:11.089 --> 01:06:11.099 align:start position:0%
unnumbered roads a lot of we call them
 
01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
tier four but they're they're um you
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
know they're the unnumbered
 
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
roads or or the lower uh numbered roads
 
01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
like like uh like a 110a or something
 
01:06:24.529 --> 01:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
like that that are not eligible for
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
federal funds so we have we have you
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
know we do have in our operating budget
 
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
um you know some State funds to support
 
01:06:35.089 --> 01:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
those but but those are only supported
 
01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
by those limited State funds so
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
um and and Andre Andre Brier is here
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
he's and we introduced you before he's
 
01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
going to go over some of the Aeronautics
 
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
Rail and Transit some of the non-highway
 
01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:50.099 align:start position:0%
and Bridge things again there are there
 
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
are there are silos of of federal
 
01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
funding that come down specifically for
 
01:06:59.450 --> 01:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
those uh needs airport money from FAA
 
01:07:02.329 --> 01:07:02.339 align:start position:0%
can only be used on airports
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
um Transit money from Federal Transit
 
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
Authority Federal Transit Administration
 
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
can only be used on Transit so
 
01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
um I think representative Murray that
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
that was kind of kind of your question
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
when we talk about kind of a capital
 
01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
program or the 10-year plan you know
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
bottom line has uh some some larger
 
01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
numbers but but certain funds can only
 
01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
be used on certain things so
 
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
and with that
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm Andre go over his
 
01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:33.250 align:start position:0%
um I'm Andre go over his
domain

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:33.260 align:start position:0%
domain
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
thank you sir and uh I do apologize I
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
was across the across the street that's
 
01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
that's why I was a little late I'm Andre
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
Briere I'm the Deputy Commissioner I've
 
01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
been in place for about a year and a
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
half I've spent most of my career in the
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
federal government I was a U.S Air Force
 
01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
pilot Transportation official came here
 
01:07:53.329 --> 01:07:53.339 align:start position:0%
uh after retiring as a U.S Air Force
 
01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
Colonel so Aeronautics is uh dear to my
 
01:07:59.690 --> 01:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
heart that's one of the uh items in my
 
01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:03.299 align:start position:0%
portfolio we have 25 uh open to the
 
01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:06.299 align:start position:0%
public airports these are small
 
01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:08.420 align:start position:0%
medium-sized airports for the most part
 
01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
uh that are really economic gateways to
 
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
these communities they're a a key piece
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
of business infrastructure there's a lot
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
of companies that won't even open
 
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
satellite offices unless they have
 
01:08:22.809 --> 01:08:22.819 align:start position:0%
access to a corporate jet capable Runway
 
01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
so these are enablers their search and
 
01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:27.299 align:start position:0%
rescue platforms their emergency
 
01:08:27.299 --> 01:08:29.229 align:start position:0%
rescue platforms their emergency
response

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
response
 
01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
centers and their most importantly for
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
our diminishing pilot Workforce and the
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
overall shortage of pilots in our
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
country that this is this is where the
 
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
education starts this is where new
 
01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
pilots are built and grown so it's it's
 
01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
in all of our interests to keep them
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
vibrant and keep them functioning
 
01:08:51.530 --> 01:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
we have three commercial airports we
 
01:08:54.769 --> 01:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
know and they largely have uh while we
 
01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
most of their federal funds do get
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
passed on through us they have their own
 
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
relationships with FAA as well
 
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
Manchester Boston in particular uh
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and peas and Lebanon
 
01:09:09.289 --> 01:09:09.299 align:start position:0%
but we are part of What's called the the
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh block grant program so
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
um 10 states uh to include us uh have
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
been granted greater authorities to act
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
in proxy of FAA uh in awarding certain
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
funds uh to our federal aid eligible
 
01:09:29.570 --> 01:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
airports we're one of those 10 states
 
01:09:32.329 --> 01:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
um so we do enjoy greater autonomy that
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
does mean that that our relationship
 
01:09:37.249 --> 01:09:37.259 align:start position:0%
with FAA uh is a little bit of a hybrid
 
01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
one where we act
 
01:09:41.329 --> 01:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
um on their behalf in certain
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances that requires a greater
 
01:09:45.729 --> 01:09:45.739 align:start position:0%
degree of coordination which in turn
 
01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:49.259 align:start position:0%
requires a a greater workload from our
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
DOT employees but we think it's worth it
 
01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
to our airports
 
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
um we collect approximately uh between
 
01:09:59.570 --> 01:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
four and five hundred thousand dollars
 
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
in their uh craft registration fees
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
every year in addition to the airway
 
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
toll of about another two hundred
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
thousand we use those Monies to fund
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
operations and also to
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
um to help with projects at non-federal
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
Aid eligible airports
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
um to
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
repave runways take care of taxiways
 
01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
things like that and we schedule that uh
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
on a year by year basis
 
01:10:29.689 --> 01:10:29.699 align:start position:0%
on the rail side uh we do have about 194
 
01:10:32.209 --> 01:10:32.219 align:start position:0%
miles of active state-owned track and we
 
01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
have agreements with six uh rail
 
01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
operators uh to to operate on those
 
01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
tracks we have far more inactive tracks
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
about 333 miles so we try to do uh some
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
creative things with those to make
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
maintain them uh and our mandate is to
 
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're viable for future
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
rail if at any point that's desired but
 
01:10:57.890 --> 01:10:57.900 align:start position:0%
we do things like rail Trails
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
um the rail bike operators that you see
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
up in Laconia and also near here in
 
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
Concord tourism
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh so we try to maintain those
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
um the rail trail plan that was just
 
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
completed will be uh I think shared more
 
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
widely with this committee and others in
 
01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
the legislature in coming weeks uh for a
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
a rail trail plan that'll link all of
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
our rail Trails uh and increase tourism
 
01:11:26.209 --> 01:11:26.219 align:start position:0%
in the process so that's that's one of
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
the great things we can do with an
 
01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
active rail line on the Public Public
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
Transit side as the commissioner said we
 
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
deal with FTA Federal Transit
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
Administration they're of all the usdot
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
entities that are probably the easiest
 
01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
to work with and the most accommodating
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
and flexible
 
01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
um and in turn I think we have a very
 
01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
excellent relationship with our 11 uh
 
01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
public transit providers here in the
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
state Coast Concord Coach Bus Express
 
01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:54.770 align:start position:0%
state Coast Concord Coach Bus Express
Etc

01:11:54.770 --> 01:11:54.780 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
we see on the transit side a gradual
 
01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
return to pre-2020 levels it's a little
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
spotty there are altered commuting
 
01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
patterns we see more commuting Tuesday
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
Wednesday Thursday
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
less Monday and Friday
 
01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
this is consistent with patterns that
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
are really happening throughout the
 
01:12:15.770 --> 01:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
country where it goes from here who
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
knows right it's still very much in flux
 
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
I've got a I've got a son who entered
 
01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
the workforce during the pandemic he's
 
01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
on a hybrid schedule I just told him
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
don't get used to it oh let's go all
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
it's gonna take is a recession and
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
you're gonna be back in the office five
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
days a week so we'll see we'll see
 
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
but we are keeping a close eye on that
 
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
and there is a there's a the only thing
 
01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:37.980 align:start position:0%
I'll mention there is there's a little
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
bit of a
 
01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:42.659 align:start position:0%
of dilemma chicken and egg in that if
 
01:12:44.689 --> 01:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
you do reduce service to acknowledge
 
01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
current realities then it reduces the
 
01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
willingness of riders to ride so and
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
then you get into a doom Loop and so
 
01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to be measured we're trying
 
01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
not to make drastic decisions right now
 
01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
until it becomes very clear uh what
 
01:12:59.630 --> 01:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
these commuting patterns are going to
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
and just uh before you go on I had
 
01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier on a budget slide that
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
we had a 0.2 percent draw on on the
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
general fund the general fund really uh
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
pays for the um Personnel
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
um in in this in this division uh so
 
01:13:21.649 --> 01:13:21.659 align:start position:0%
just the dot workers there because the
 
01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
highway fund is constitutionally
 
01:13:26.689 --> 01:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
protected to only pay for um
 
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
um things related to that to the highway
 
01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.810 align:start position:0%
um things related to that to the highway
so

01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
um this division is is a small draw on
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
the general fund which that's that's
 
01:13:36.169 --> 01:13:36.179 align:start position:0%
actually an excellent point to make one
 
01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
additional point the the one item that's
 
01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
not under Aeronautics is our growing uas
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
drone capability and and we at dot we
 
01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
take pictures of things and projects we
 
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
don't take pictures of people using our
 
01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
drones it is much cheaper for us to
 
01:13:51.410 --> 01:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
operate those uas's than to contract
 
01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
that work out but as the commissioner
 
01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:54.950 align:start position:0%
that work out but as the commissioner
said

01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
we have to you know these are general
 
01:14:00.290 --> 01:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
fund funded positions
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
the colors of money come into play here
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
so if if those uas's are used on Federal
 
01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
Highway projects how do we how do we
 
01:14:11.209 --> 01:14:11.219 align:start position:0%
properly build those and fund the
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
positions that would support those so
 
01:14:15.890 --> 01:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
this is an ongoing ongoing issue but
 
01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
we're very excited about our uas
 
01:14:20.750 --> 01:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
capability and we do we uh just acquired
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
a drone that can do lidar so you can you
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
can map ground through trees and it's
 
01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
fantastic and it really does add value
 
01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
to our projects
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
moving on to Administration uh also
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
under my portfolio at dot we have the
 
01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
executive office which uh which does
 
01:14:41.689 --> 01:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
everything that that all agency
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
Executive offices do
 
01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:47.659 align:start position:0%
um on the HR side making sure that uh
 
01:14:50.649 --> 01:14:50.659 align:start position:0%
agency-wide costs are are taken care of
 
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
we put a lot of focus on management
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
strategy on Asset Management that's also
 
01:14:58.610 --> 01:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
a capability we've grown over several
 
01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
years under commissioner cass's
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
leadership we're doing a top to bottom
 
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
review making sure we're using our
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
dollars that are appropriated by this
 
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
body in the most efficient way possible
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
into the into the the greatest effect
 
01:15:15.290 --> 01:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
and on the finance side uh the colors of
 
01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
money as the commissioner mentioned are
 
01:15:20.689 --> 01:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
numerous and very colorful and they
 
01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
don't mix so our finance office does an
 
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
incredible job keeping all that straight
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
and making sure again that we're using
 
01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
those in an efficient way we also have a
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
lot of responsibilities on our project
 
01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
for federal compliance we have internal
 
01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:39.620 align:start position:0%
audit as well that makes sure that we're
 
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
keeping on the good side of all
 
01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
appropriate regulations and laws and
 
01:15:46.990 --> 01:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
under Administration is also policy
 
01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
formulation and a good amount of
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
Workforce analytics this is the
 
01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
discussion that's already happened here
 
01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
this morning that's talking about
 
01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:56.940 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates we look at that with a
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
fine-tooth comb every day
 
01:16:03.649 --> 01:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
and it's it's unprecedented we have uh
 
01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
for the most part our Department's
 
01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
hovering around a quarter of our of our
 
01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
positions of vacant
 
01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
um there are some bureaus where that
 
01:16:14.209 --> 01:16:14.219 align:start position:0%
goes as high as 89 percent there are
 
01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:15.900 align:start position:0%
some that it's that it's slightly lower
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
than the average but by and large these
 
01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
are historic numbers we're seeing just
 
01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
means everybody is pedaling that much
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
harder just to try to tread water but
 
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
they're doing a great job makes it
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon us as leadership to make
 
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
sure we're as focused as possible during
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
so last slide that I'll brief uh has to
 
01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
do with the highway fund that's been
 
01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:38.630 align:start position:0%
do with the highway fund that's been
mentioned

01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
so it's a point we always try to make
 
01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
um and we try not to be patronizing here
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
but just to make the point that the
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
highway fund is not DOT and Dot is not
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
the highway fund they're uh we don't
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
collect Highway fund revenues that's the
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
um we're also not the only organization
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
that uses Highway fund Revenue
 
01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:00.410 align:start position:0%
that uses Highway fund Revenue
um

01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
it is a primary source for our operating
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
budget and you know you're looking at
 
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
the split there that you see on the
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
bottom it's approximately 60 percent of
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
the highway fund does go to us uh to
 
01:17:12.649 --> 01:17:12.659 align:start position:0%
fund our activities
 
01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
um but uh safety uh judicial branch and
 
01:17:18.229 --> 01:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
Justice also uh get a fair amount of
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
those monies and a lot of it's passed
 
01:17:22.669 --> 01:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
through to municipalities
 
01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
so that roughly covers my portfolio
 
01:17:29.090 --> 01:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
um Aviation rail Transit Administration
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
and finance and I'll pause there if
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
there are any questions on any of those
 
01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.930 align:start position:0%
there are any questions on any of those
items

01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
being here and thanks for being Air
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
Force yeah there you go sir right uh
 
01:17:45.590 --> 01:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
peace yes what are we doing to uh
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
maximize that uh asset I mean we've got
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
11 000 foot Runway which is I mean
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's a valuable asset I've landed
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
there many times right well welcome yeah
 
01:17:58.250 --> 01:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
and uh but it doesn't seem like it I I
 
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
know the P's base itself is developing
 
01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
but the the runway that's that's an
 
01:18:05.209 --> 01:18:05.219 align:start position:0%
awful asset to be just sitting here just
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
for as little as I couldn't agree more
 
01:18:09.649 --> 01:18:09.659 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree more and uh in fact last
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
week we're uh in close coordination uh
 
01:18:13.729 --> 01:18:13.739 align:start position:0%
with Senator
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
um Shaheen's office to deal with the
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
Customs issue that's going on there
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
right now that gets to your point
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
exactly we need to make sure that uh our
 
01:18:24.169 --> 01:18:24.179 align:start position:0%
federal partners are ready to support
 
01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:26.699 align:start position:0%
the increased traffic flow that we
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
intend and the PS the peas Development
 
01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
Authority intends uh to spin up uh and
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
more fully utilize that asset
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
um it's a fair amount of consternation
 
01:18:39.169 --> 01:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
back and forth but with Senator
 
01:18:42.169 --> 01:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
Shaheen's leadership and her staff I
 
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
think we're going to crack it we've got
 
01:18:45.890 --> 01:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
the right members of my team involved
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
and I have long history with with
 
01:18:51.649 --> 01:18:51.659 align:start position:0%
Customs so we're going to make sure that
 
01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:53.340 align:start position:0%
they accommodate the needs of of
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
increased traffic flow but it is a
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
multi-year process agree with you
 
01:18:59.689 --> 01:18:59.699 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly that's a big piece of uh
 
01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
Runway right there that that we need to
 
01:19:03.649 --> 01:19:03.659 align:start position:0%
utilize more fully you know that can
 
01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
include things like increased FBO
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
utilization increased on the private
 
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
side certainly the commercial side as
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
well but we're fully behind those
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
efforts and uh and in fact I've got a
 
01:19:17.689 --> 01:19:17.699 align:start position:0%
schedule I'm going to spend a day with
 
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
them I believe in two weeks going down
 
01:19:23.689 --> 01:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
there myself to to talk about future
 
01:19:23.699 --> 01:19:24.890 align:start position:0%
there myself to to talk about future
plans

01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
plans
 
01:19:28.689 --> 01:19:28.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
so with that that covers kind of the
 
01:19:33.229 --> 01:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
general overview of the department
 
01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:34.980 align:start position:0%
um the following slide issues and
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
challenges are some of the things that
 
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:39.060 align:start position:0%
we had discussed um
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
um as part of our budget presentation to
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and that I
 
01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
um and we've touched on a lot of these
 
01:19:47.209 --> 01:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
through through the discussion here
 
01:19:47.219 --> 01:19:48.290 align:start position:0%
through through the discussion here
already

01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:48.300 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:19:50.030 --> 01:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
um some of those four big bullet points
 
01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
the inflation we've hit on on that some
 
01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:55.260 align:start position:0%
of the supply chain issues in terms of
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
procurement delays particularly with our
 
01:19:59.810 --> 01:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
equipment Andre had mentioned the
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
workforce vacancies that uh we had we
 
01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
are seeing historically High vacancy
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
rates we have a lot of difficulty
 
01:20:10.090 --> 01:20:10.100 align:start position:0%
attracting and retaining employees
 
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
and especially and Dave had talked about
 
01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
the hiring of plow operators and hired
 
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
trucks and some of the difficulties
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
there so we don't have real uh answers
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
other than just highlighting that these
 
01:20:23.950 --> 01:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
are issues and challenges one of the
 
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
aspects of of that
 
01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:27.350 align:start position:0%
aspects of of that
um

01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:29.689 --> 01:20:29.699 align:start position:0%
uh it also deals with the productivity
 
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
so we are
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
um we are are prioritizing work with
 
01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
these vacancy rates to make sure that
 
01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:38.940 align:start position:0%
the light safety make sure the things
 
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
that need to get done do get done
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
um for example
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
um over this past summer I had mentioned
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
about the highway striping we try to
 
01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
stripe every every every road
 
01:20:52.490 --> 01:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
um once a year if if we can we
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
historically rely on a lot of temporary
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
employees we have not been able to hire
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
those in the past I mean in in this past
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
year so we are are pulling
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
um people from the maintenance districts
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
putting them on the on the striping
 
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
trucks to make sure that that work gets
 
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
done the consequence of that is there
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
are fewer people
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
um in the in the maintenance District
 
01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
you know doing some of the work that
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
that they need to in terms of ditching
 
01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
or replacing pipes or things like that
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
so some of our work plan productivity
 
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
targets um are are are falling off
 
01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
because of that prioritization of
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
limited resources similarly this winter
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
with the snow with a number of the snow
 
01:21:40.610 --> 01:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
plow operators we had sent out a word
 
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
um for people that have CDL licenses
 
01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
that don't necessarily work in Highway
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
Maintenance to solicit their
 
01:21:49.199 --> 01:21:51.649 align:start position:0%
Maintenance to solicit their
um

01:21:51.649 --> 01:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh solicit them to work plowing the
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
roads this winter and we have about I
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
think it's about 80 about 80 or so
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
Volunteers in various parts of the
 
01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
department that have CDL licenses that
 
01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
are going to be plowing for us that are
 
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
going to be doing winter maintenance
 
01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
this year because that's our priority
 
01:22:10.970 --> 01:22:10.980 align:start position:0%
during the winter
 
01:22:14.689 --> 01:22:14.699 align:start position:0%
that does mean that there's adso people
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
um that aren't doing their regular job
 
01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
throughout throughout the winter a
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
number of those are in are in Bridge
 
01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:20.750 align:start position:0%
number of those are in are in Bridge
maintenance

01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:21.649 align:start position:0%
maintenance
um

01:22:21.649 --> 01:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
um they do a lot of work
 
01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:25.380 align:start position:0%
um you might see some of the bridge
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
bridge maintenance work alongside of the
 
01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
road there winter season they put up
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
enclosures and they and they work on a
 
01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
number of bridges and stuff but uh again
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
some of those work work plan targets and
 
01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
the predict productivity there are going
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
to be falling off as we prioritize those
 
01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
resources on what we need to get done so
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
it is a it is it is a balance uh but uh
 
01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
you know our fear is that by um
 
01:22:53.930 --> 01:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
you know prioritizing those critical
 
01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
areas there are going to be preventative
 
01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
maintenance work that should be getting
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
done that that is going to be put off
 
01:23:02.090 --> 01:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
and could um have
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
um you know some consequences
 
01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
ramifications in the future
 
01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
um but we'll continue to monitor that
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
and do the best we can
 
01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
um we had some on on the final page uh
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
are some longer term challenges that
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
that we continue to uh
 
01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
work through
 
01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:21.719 align:start position:0%
um you know funding
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
division two Finance I'm sure you're
 
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
going to hear this all season long this
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
there there is that there's never enough
 
01:23:28.669 --> 01:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
funding to do everything everybody wants
 
01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
um and particularly on the highway fund
 
01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:33.410 align:start position:0%
um and particularly on the highway fund
revenues

01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
um you know the highway fund has has
 
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
does have some structural deficits it's
 
01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.890 align:start position:0%
does have some structural deficits it's
been

01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
um balanced by a whole series of of
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
um one-off
 
01:23:48.410 --> 01:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
um things every every year to balance it
 
01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
but it continues to be a structural
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
balance a structural deficit when you
 
01:23:54.649 --> 01:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
look at it the the
 
01:23:56.930 --> 01:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
um the Appropriations the outflows the
 
01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:58.790 align:start position:0%
um the Appropriations the outflows the
expenditures

01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
um exceed annually the the amount of
 
01:24:05.689 --> 01:24:05.699 align:start position:0%
Revenue come coming in so that is a
 
01:24:08.570 --> 01:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
again a longer term challenge we also
 
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
have a challenge with finding State
 
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
funds to match federal federal funds um
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
we as a state bring very little State
 
01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.990 align:start position:0%
we as a state bring very little State
funds

01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
um to our our Highway and bridge program
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
we are Reliant a hundred percent on the
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
federal funds for those many other
 
01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
states have
 
01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
um more robust state-funded programs to
 
01:24:34.610 --> 01:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
take care of
 
01:24:36.649 --> 01:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
both the matching needs for the federal
 
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
funds as as well as you know more of the
 
01:24:43.729 --> 01:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
paving programs and things like that and
 
01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
I had mentioned about a third of our
 
01:24:48.530 --> 01:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
highway mileage in New Hampshire is not
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
eligible for federal funds so that does
 
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
continue to be a long-term challenge
 
01:24:57.169 --> 01:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
those limited State funds for the
 
01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
non-federal aid eligible highways
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I just a very quick
 
01:25:05.149 --> 01:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
question you were talking about the lack
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
of matching funds I want to make sure
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
whether you are talking about the State
 
01:25:11.689 --> 01:25:11.699 align:start position:0%
losing potential Federal money because
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
we don't match funds or are you talking
 
01:25:16.930 --> 01:25:16.940 align:start position:0%
about us our Reliance on federal money
 
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
underfunding you know the projects or
 
01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
both I just again I'm new so
 
01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:26.870 align:start position:0%
both I just again I'm new so
um

01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:29.780 align:start position:0%
well I I I keep phrase the question
 
01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
basically when you say matching funds
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
yeah there are scenarios in which we
 
01:25:35.689 --> 01:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
were supposed to put 10 mil to get five
 
01:25:37.310 --> 01:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
mil from the feds and we don't put 10
 
01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
meals so we lose the five mil or you
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
could say I could also interpret that
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
statement to be the feds are spending
 
01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
money on our state but we don't spend an
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
equivalent fund but that would not lead
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
to loss of revenues it would just be a
 
01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
opinion on how much you know we would
 
01:25:53.450 --> 01:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
need to maintain so I'm just trying to
 
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
understand if it's one or both or which
 
01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:56.570 align:start position:0%
understand if it's one or both or which
right

01:25:56.570 --> 01:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:25:58.850 --> 01:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
um so as far as the the matching of
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
federal funds we are not in jeopardy of
 
01:26:02.689 --> 01:26:02.699 align:start position:0%
losing any federal funds for lack of
 
01:26:04.850 --> 01:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
match there are other states are a state
 
01:26:06.169 --> 01:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
right next door
 
01:26:06.179 --> 01:26:06.890 align:start position:0%
right next door
um

01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
um Vermont one of their big challenges
 
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh as I understand it from talking to
 
01:26:13.729 --> 01:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
our colleagues there
 
01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
um is uh insufficient State funds to
 
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
match the the federal fund so with the
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Bill and additional
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
federal funds that are that are coming
 
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
um their challenge is going to be
 
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
finding State funds to match those
 
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
federal dollars
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
um we have the benefit in New Hampshire
 
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
um of of relying on uh um relying on a
 
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh thing called Turnpike toll credits so
 
01:26:43.550 --> 01:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that we invest in
 
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
our Turnpike system we are able to
 
01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
um use that as a credit toward matching
 
01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
the federal funds so currently we have
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
plenty of uh Turnpike uh investment so
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
we are not at risk of losing any federal
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
funds it does mean though that the
 
01:27:02.209 --> 01:27:02.219 align:start position:0%
federal funds that we do receive don't
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
go as far as if they had you know
 
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
additional safety funds so
 
01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
just where I was going with my question
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
um I travel around my easy pass takes me
 
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
all down the coast practically and I go
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
through all these states and I pay a lot
 
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
of money in tolls I go through New
 
01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't pay very much I go to
 
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I go to Maine I go into
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
New York I really pay a lot of money
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
um it just it seems like we're and I
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
love my state and I love the fact that
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't cost a lot to go from one end
 
01:27:39.649 --> 01:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
to the other but the fact is are we
 
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
missing out on something by not raising
 
01:27:44.689 --> 01:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
um potentially I mean there there is a
 
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has one of the lower lower
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
toll rates um I just spent the weekend
 
01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:53.639 align:start position:0%
in in um New York and coming coming
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
across some of the New York bridges when
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
they're 15 tolls make our three dollar
 
01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
total three dollar total at Hampton seem
 
01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
very uh
 
01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:02.510 align:start position:0%
very uh
um

01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
I know very very uh affordable very a
 
01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
bargain so but those are public policy
 
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
things that that we can that we can talk
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
about I will say in in past years
 
01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
through the 10-year plan we've tried to
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
at least highlight from the capital
 
01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:19.010 align:start position:0%
at least highlight from the capital
program

01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:28:20.290 --> 01:28:20.300 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
what's what what the funding stream on
 
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
on the turnpike system what that's doing
 
01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
to some of those major capital projects
 
01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
it's extending it's it's extending them
 
01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
them out
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
um so those are some of the public
 
01:28:34.669 --> 01:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
policy choices we'll have to uh debate
 
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
and talk about thank you one more just
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the gas tax
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
um people using electric cars so I know
 
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of legislation coming
 
01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
toward that but I think these are all
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
things we've got especially for the work
 
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:50.940 align:start position:0%
that you folks are doing I'm really
 
01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:52.980 align:start position:0%
concerned about where all this money is
 
01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
going to come from and I know that your
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
Highway fund has been I I think the last
 
01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
time didn't we talk about like 40
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars that we needed to move
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
there or do something because it was the
 
01:29:07.850 --> 01:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
LA at the end of the last session I
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
think uh the Senate moved 50 50 million
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
dollars from general fund Surplus into
 
01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
the highway fund uh ostensibly to look
 
01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
at um
 
01:29:18.709 --> 01:29:18.719 align:start position:0%
covering us carrying carrying the
 
01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
highway fund through this through this
 
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
upcoming biennium yeah
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah you're welcome
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
do you know what that Gap might be this
 
01:29:29.810 --> 01:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
year with the highway fund um well I
 
01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
guess we'll get that one yeah we'll get
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
that when we have the budget we're all
 
01:29:36.050 --> 01:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
waiting to see the budget presentation
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
and things yeah
 
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.209 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
um

01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:41.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
yeah what was I going to say
 
01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
the uh it leaded to uh what she was
 
01:29:49.370 --> 01:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
saying about the 90 to 110 million
 
01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
dollars in equipment that you have now
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
in the past I believe we bonded for 20
 
01:29:58.669 --> 01:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
years a piece of equipment the last 12.
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
are we looking at in other words for the
 
01:30:02.450 --> 01:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
people that haven't been on this
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
committee this is that's an important we
 
01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that I mean because
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
after 12 years you don't have the you're
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
still paying on something you don't even
 
01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
have correct could you allude to that
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you for asking that question
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
and your various do we did bond for the
 
01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
equipment the what we did though we made
 
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
sure to bond for 10 years and we only
 
01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
purchased equipment that had a useful
 
01:30:32.090 --> 01:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
life of 10 years or greater so we could
 
01:30:36.530 --> 01:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
not use those bonded funds for for our
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
um automobiles that aren't going to last
 
01:30:42.410 --> 01:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
10 years but they they were very helpful
 
01:30:45.290 --> 01:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
for us to catch up on the heavy
 
01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
equipment that does have a useful life
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
of 12 or more years
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
and if I may uh one of the things that
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh you folks do I believe you build your
 
01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:58.020 align:start position:0%
own trucks and that's that probably
 
01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
saves money and you in the long run
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
because you're getting them exactly like
 
01:31:03.890 --> 01:31:03.900 align:start position:0%
you want and I really appreciate your
 
01:31:06.110 --> 01:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
what you do on the highways because uh
 
01:31:07.970 --> 01:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
you know going down that road after it
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
snowed the night before and they're nice
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
and clean that's beautiful
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that's all we had we had for
 
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
presentation but any further questions
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
or any other information you'd you would
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
want for us well selfishly I'm curious
 
01:31:25.129 --> 01:31:25.139 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:31:28.129 --> 01:31:28.139 align:start position:0%
project in Hampton I'm from Hampton okay
 
01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
and I'm the chairman of the planning
 
01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:30.229 align:start position:0%
and I'm the chairman of the planning
board

01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
and we've got a project hanging out
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
there to sell sell off the liquor store
 
01:31:36.239 --> 01:31:37.910 align:start position:0%
there to sell sell off the liquor store
stores

01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
stores
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
property to private Enterprise
 
01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:44.820 align:start position:0%
to be developed it like Hooksett
 
01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
where are we in that because that came
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
before the planning board two years ago
 
01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
yeah we uh the Department of
 
01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
Transportation doesn't have any
 
01:31:55.209 --> 01:31:55.219 align:start position:0%
involvement in that that's all being
 
01:31:59.390 --> 01:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
worked on by uh um Department of liquor
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
really yeah yeah we haven't had any
 
01:32:03.530 --> 01:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
involvement in that
 
01:32:09.470 --> 01:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
go back and talk about
 
01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
talk about short uh Workforce vacancies
 
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:15.780 align:start position:0%
sure and maybe you could just describe
 
01:32:18.770 --> 01:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
what you've learned anecdotally from you
 
01:32:21.050 --> 01:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
know some of your experience in trying
 
01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:22.550 align:start position:0%
know some of your experience in trying
to

01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:32:24.290 --> 01:32:24.300 align:start position:0%
fill those vacancies what are you
 
01:32:27.770 --> 01:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
hearing from applicants in terms of why
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
um or from you know your experience what
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
what are some of the causes you believe
 
01:32:35.390 --> 01:32:35.400 align:start position:0%
of this vacancy rate being so high right
 
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
I think the number one the number one
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
cause has been uh um has been the level
 
01:32:42.530 --> 01:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
of compensation that the state wage
 
01:32:45.110 --> 01:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
rates offer we've had particularly in
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
the operation side uh over the past
 
01:32:50.209 --> 01:32:50.219 align:start position:0%
several years as cities and towns are
 
01:32:53.709 --> 01:32:53.719 align:start position:0%
more Nimble or or have more um
 
01:32:56.209 --> 01:32:56.219 align:start position:0%
flexibility I think
 
01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
um we've been finding a number of those
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance
 
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
positions people are leaving for three
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
four five dollars more an hour working
 
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
in the same town for the municipality
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
with with I think particularly through
 
01:33:11.810 --> 01:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
the municipalities they have relatively
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
similar benefits packages as the as the
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh as the state so I think that has been
 
01:33:18.239 --> 01:33:19.129 align:start position:0%
uh as the state so I think that has been
the

01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
um that has been the number one
 
01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:21.709 align:start position:0%
um that has been the number one
challenge

01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
the overall unemployment rate is is
 
01:33:26.209 --> 01:33:26.219 align:start position:0%
another thing as well too I mean as we
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
were talking about it you know
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
particularly last winter with with our
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
with our staff you know they they were
 
01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
seeing the the vacancy right rates climb
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
and and concerned but at the time you
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
know every every Dunkin Donuts had had
 
01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
the hiring and having Limited hours
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
because they couldn't find
 
01:33:47.930 --> 01:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
people to work either so I think
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
um you know the the
 
01:33:52.850 --> 01:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
compensation rate and and overall
 
01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate have been the two
 
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
biggest factors I'm hopeful I'm
 
01:34:00.050 --> 01:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
optimistic that um the um
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
tentative agreement that's been that's
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
been reached through with the collective
 
01:34:05.709 --> 01:34:05.719 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement will will help
 
01:34:08.290 --> 01:34:08.300 align:start position:0%
mitigate some some of that
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
certainly we saw uh I I don't know if
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
you're aware but at the end of at the
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
end of last summer into into this fall
 
01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
coming into the winter
 
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
um uh through the governor's office and
 
01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal committee we did get
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.330 --> 01:34:29.340 align:start position:0%
retention and recruitment bonus
 
01:34:31.490 --> 01:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
um about five thousand dollars for the
 
01:34:33.169 --> 01:34:33.179 align:start position:0%
for the winter they get half up front
 
01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:34.940 align:start position:0%
and half if they stay the whole winter
 
01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
and when we instituted that
 
01:34:40.310 --> 01:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
um I I won't say it brought many more
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
people in but we did we did it did seem
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
to stem the tide we would
 
01:34:48.110 --> 01:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
tracking the vacancy rate climbing
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
climbing and stuff and it did seem to
 
01:34:52.669 --> 01:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
when when that guy instituted you know
 
01:34:55.010 --> 01:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
kind of leveled off at that 22 percent
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
or so is that yeah anything more
 
01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
yes that you you all the legislature had
 
01:35:04.189 --> 01:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
passed a law in uh the last
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
um session to allow Recruitment and
 
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
Retention bonuses we targeted that to
 
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
our greatest need well we knew you you
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
all would see on a daily basis towards
 
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh when a maintenance positions
 
01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
um and as Bill said that did two things
 
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
for us one it flattened the curve so it
 
01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:26.330 align:start position:0%
for us one it flattened the curve so it
stopped

01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
stopped
 
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
um folks from from leaving didn't bring
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
a whole lot more but we what we also
 
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
used that enhancement for was to invite
 
01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
people from other state agencies and
 
01:35:43.129 --> 01:35:43.139 align:start position:0%
from within dot that had CDL licenses to
 
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
come in and work with us to do win a
 
01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance so we have about a 27
 
01:35:52.550 --> 01:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate and win a maintenance and
 
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
the only reason representative Petrie is
 
01:35:57.410 --> 01:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
happy with that road condition when he
 
01:35:59.810 --> 01:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
gets on on the road is because we have
 
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
80 internal and 10 folks from other
 
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
state agencies helping us to plow snow
 
01:36:09.169 --> 01:36:09.179 align:start position:0%
this winter now that's getting us by
 
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
does that come without issues I had a
 
01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
phone call this morning and a
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
conversation about one of those drivers
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
with less experience on the road so not
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
a recommended long-term solution but it
 
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
certainly got us where we could provide
 
01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
something that is acceptable to you all
 
01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
this winter we thank you for for giving
 
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
us those tools those are the tools we
 
01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
need to react more quickly so thank you
 
01:36:40.669 --> 01:36:40.679 align:start position:0%
all for that support and just adding
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
what assistant commissioner on to what
 
01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:45.900 align:start position:0%
he said assistant commissioner rodrigue
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
we we like I said we track this daily
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
and you can see the the effect of these
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
things and that that did really slow the
 
01:36:57.290 --> 01:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
bleeding we've actually seen a an
 
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
improve movement and the actual vacancy
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
rate when it comes to operations
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
positions in the last couple weeks
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
however this is not although we've
 
01:37:09.169 --> 01:37:09.179 align:start position:0%
addressed operations and we've really
 
01:37:11.209 --> 01:37:11.219 align:start position:0%
focused on it because that's that's the
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
business end of dot that's what people
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
see they see the roads uh especially in
 
01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
winter in those conditions
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
this is a top to bottom issue though if
 
01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
you look at some of our vacancies in our
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
engineering Workforce they're stunning
 
01:37:27.649 --> 01:37:27.659 align:start position:0%
worse than than our operations positions
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
that affects our ability to deliver our
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
10-year plan long term if we don't have
 
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
those that expertise within the
 
01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
department it not only costs more to
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
contract that out in some cases that
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
resource is also tapped because every
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
state in the country got a whole lot of
 
01:37:47.209 --> 01:37:47.219 align:start position:0%
iija money that they're trying to spend
 
01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
and every engineering firm in the
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
country is going after that work right
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
so we're in line with a lot of New
 
01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
England states so it is incumbent upon
 
01:37:58.370 --> 01:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
us to also go after our engineering
 
01:38:00.649 --> 01:38:00.659 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortfalls and that's
 
01:38:02.090 --> 01:38:02.100 align:start position:0%
something that the commissioner has
 
01:38:05.209 --> 01:38:05.219 align:start position:0%
focused us on as well just just to uh I
 
01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're aware that the
 
01:38:09.770 --> 01:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
state purchased a hospital
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
last year and the way they're Staffing
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
that hospital is with a contract yeah
 
01:38:18.050 --> 01:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
not with state employees
 
01:38:20.689 --> 01:38:20.699 align:start position:0%
uh I mean there are state employees like
 
01:38:22.729 --> 01:38:22.739 align:start position:0%
six or seven that are quote senior
 
01:38:26.090 --> 01:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
managers but the whole hospital is a is
 
01:38:28.090 --> 01:38:28.100 align:start position:0%
a contract Service
 
01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
relationship so they can pay enough to
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
have the staff they need right and I'm
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
I'm only throwing that out there as a
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
model I'm not saying you can do the same
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
thing but there may be something there
 
01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
it's just it's a lot more expensive oh
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
yeah oh no doubt about it but at least
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
it gets done yeah and the other thing
 
01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
that came to mind when you talk about
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
trucks and independent contractors if
 
01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
they're paid hourly that's a that's a
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
very fragile relationship I mean I'm not
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
going to go out and spend 150 200 000
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
for a truck in case you're going to call
 
01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.149 align:start position:0%
for a truck in case you're going to call
me

01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:39:04.850 --> 01:39:04.860 align:start position:0%
so it seems like there's somewhere down
 
01:39:08.050 --> 01:39:08.060 align:start position:0%
the road there may be a public private
 
01:39:12.169 --> 01:39:12.179 align:start position:0%
strategy to help people that want to be
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
independent contractors funding their
 
01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
trucks or or somehow helping them be
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
successful but that'll have to be
 
01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
Revenue with with a minimum for the
 
01:39:25.129 --> 01:39:25.139 align:start position:0%
winter I mean
 
01:39:27.169 --> 01:39:27.179 align:start position:0%
I've been involved in Condos for quite a
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
while and we don't have contractors by
 
01:39:31.010 --> 01:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
the storm
 
01:39:34.490 --> 01:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
our our contractors to do snow removal
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
get paid whether it snows or not
 
01:39:39.410 --> 01:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
some years they win some years they lose
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
but it's a flat rate so I'm just again
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
keeping everything a variable cost
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
seems like it's going to be probably
 
01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
more problematic if our labor situation
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
gets worse that's all right just
 
01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
throwing it out that's a good point I
 
01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
know I know with our with our with our
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
Hyde plows we do they are guaranteed a
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
10 hour minimum a week so we do they
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
they have some Revenue stream that they
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
can Bank on and and stuff so um
 
01:40:07.610 --> 01:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
and there are other there are other
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
models similar to what you said we've
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
looked uh we've worked closely with
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
colleagues in at Maine DOT who have um
 
01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it's called
 
01:40:18.770 --> 01:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
experimenting but they have gone down
 
01:40:21.169 --> 01:40:21.179 align:start position:0%
the road of Contracting out uh some some
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
of their um winter maintenance some of
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
their maintenance operations and stuff I
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
think to mixed results is to make three
 
01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
great uh thank you uh I'm really happy
 
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
to see the tolls on the total operators
 
01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
being taken out of Rochester and Dover
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
are you playing it and how much money is
 
01:40:49.010 --> 01:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
that save and are you planning to do
 
01:40:51.110 --> 01:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
that for Hampton also Beyond you know we
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
spanned the Hampton uh
 
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:55.790 align:start position:0%
spanned the Hampton uh
tall

01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
oh wow so was that as I go with that
 
01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
plan to remove them all
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have a plan at this point to
 
01:41:05.689 --> 01:41:05.699 align:start position:0%
to move the whole system to all
 
01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
electronic tolling like Massachusetts
 
01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:09.169 align:start position:0%
electronic tolling like Massachusetts
did

01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:41:12.709 --> 01:41:12.719 align:start position:0%
um Rochester and Dover as um as a as it
 
01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
as as those uh barrier toll plazas were
 
01:41:19.729 --> 01:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
dated and and and needed some sort of
 
01:41:22.430 --> 01:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
investment you know we looked
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
um both at Open Road tolling like it
 
01:41:26.810 --> 01:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
exists in Hampton and
 
01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:27.950 align:start position:0%
exists in Hampton and
um

01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
um hooks it and all electronic tolling
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
and and with the state of the uh um the
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
industry and where it's going the
 
01:41:40.129 --> 01:41:40.139 align:start position:0%
technology as well as as you mentioned
 
01:41:42.530 --> 01:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
kind of the cost Savings of of not
 
01:41:45.050 --> 01:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
having to maintain a full-time
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
um staff of
 
01:41:46.679 --> 01:41:47.450 align:start position:0%
um staff of
um

01:41:47.450 --> 01:41:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
toll takers
 
01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
um that that's that's the um that's we
 
01:41:55.129 --> 01:41:55.139 align:start position:0%
talked with Spalding Turnpike as as
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
those other plazas uh require some sort
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
of investment in the future we will have
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
to see so the next one
 
01:42:05.450 --> 01:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
um that we have planned for work is uh
 
01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
is the Bedford toll plaza and right now
 
01:42:10.129 --> 01:42:10.139 align:start position:0%
in the 10-year plan we are and we have
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
authority through through some of the
 
01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
discussions with the legislature for uh
 
01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
similarly doing all electronic tolling
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
on on that
 
01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
um but as far as the other the other
 
01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
major uh toll plazas nothing in the
 
01:42:26.270 --> 01:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
plans yet but
 
01:42:28.729 --> 01:42:28.739 align:start position:0%
um my supposition would be particularly
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
in Hampton I know
 
01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
um and and some degrees hooks it those
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
two lanes of of Open Road tolling are
 
01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
are getting to be on those Peak weekends
 
01:42:42.770 --> 01:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
they're getting to be a bottleneck so as
 
01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
we uh looking down the road at those
 
01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
toll plazas whether to add a um
 
01:42:52.550 --> 01:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
another uh another Lane for open road
 
01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:55.679 align:start position:0%
tolling or whether to remove the plaza
 
01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:57.659 align:start position:0%
um completely and go all electronic
 
01:42:59.470 --> 01:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
tolling those are things we'll have to
 
01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
evaluate and go through the process
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
follow-up how much money does that save
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
and uh you know between taking out the
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
tolls and how how hard is it to collect
 
01:43:13.490 --> 01:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh you know for people that try to run
 
01:43:15.649 --> 01:43:15.659 align:start position:0%
the tolls and not pay
 
01:43:19.370 --> 01:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh I don't have that information uh on
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
the tip of my uh things but I can look
 
01:43:24.109 --> 01:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
into it and get get get some information
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
to you for that I know we had similar
 
01:43:28.609 --> 01:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
questions from the executive council at
 
01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
a recent um
 
01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
at a at a recent um
 
01:43:35.149 --> 01:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
contract the design contracts for the
 
01:43:37.609 --> 01:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
Bedford toll plaza so
 
01:43:39.050 --> 01:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
um I know we're working on getting
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
getting that as far as the collection we
 
01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
do have a um a
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
a pretty robust back office system
 
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
um through through uh
 
01:43:50.570 --> 01:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
um you know through sending
 
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
notifications escalation of that to um
 
01:43:56.570 --> 01:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
to uh fines and ultimately to putting
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
putting people in um
 
01:44:01.310 --> 01:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh suspension of um
 
01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
registration rights in order to get the
 
01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
um in order to get the payment for those
 
01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
tools so
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
we do well we have reciprocal agreements
 
01:44:14.890 --> 01:44:14.900 align:start position:0%
with at least Maine and Massachusetts to
 
01:44:17.689 --> 01:44:17.699 align:start position:0%
to the bigger biggest
 
01:44:17.699 --> 01:44:18.470 align:start position:0%
to the bigger biggest
um

01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
I wanted to
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
tell for shortage sure conversation uh
 
01:44:31.129 --> 01:44:31.139 align:start position:0%
just to see what is your feeling about
 
01:44:32.649 --> 01:44:32.659 align:start position:0%
um our comparison
 
01:44:35.930 --> 01:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
rates with our New England neighbors are
 
01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
we I mean I assume the problem is
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
universal across the United States but
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
um you know specifically in New England
 
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
how do we fare in terms of our neighbors
 
01:44:47.689 --> 01:44:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
um I'd I'd have to check I don't have
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
the numbers of my sense though
 
01:44:54.649 --> 01:44:54.659 align:start position:0%
anecdotally is that we are behind them I
 
01:44:56.689 --> 01:44:56.699 align:start position:0%
know um last winter when we were having
 
01:44:59.450 --> 01:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
similar concerns and debates
 
01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:00.109 align:start position:0%
similar concerns and debates
um

01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:02.090 --> 01:45:02.100 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason however they're
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
structured both Vermont and
 
01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts were were able to put in
 
01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:09.770 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts were were able to put in
place

01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:10.790 align:start position:0%
place
um

01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
um pay raising increases for those for
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
those Staffing
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not quite sure how they're
 
01:45:19.370 --> 01:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining or how their um
 
01:45:23.570 --> 01:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
things are structured but um
 
01:45:25.729 --> 01:45:25.739 align:start position:0%
um both both Vermont and Massachusetts I
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
know have had recent pay increases which
 
01:45:30.649 --> 01:45:30.659 align:start position:0%
put them above and I think Dave you
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
might know I know um
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
Maine had done a similar thing I think a
 
01:45:37.609 --> 01:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago
 
01:45:37.619 --> 01:45:38.270 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago
um

01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
I think they're they're
 
01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:41.090 align:start position:0%
I think they're they're
um

01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:43.810 --> 01:45:43.820 align:start position:0%
their enhancement was uh
 
01:45:47.149 --> 01:45:47.159 align:start position:0%
accomplished very similar to
 
01:45:49.129 --> 01:45:49.139 align:start position:0%
um how like Health and Human Services
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
have have done have have addressed the
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
nursing shortage you know they've gone
 
01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
to government council with a enhancement
 
01:45:58.970 --> 01:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
wage targeted specifically for those
 
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
workers so so between again anecdotally
 
01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
um what what I know has transpired at
 
01:46:07.729 --> 01:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
our three neighboring states I do
 
01:46:09.410 --> 01:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
believe that we are
 
01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:10.450 align:start position:0%
believe that we are
um

01:46:10.450 --> 01:46:10.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:17.090 --> 01:46:17.100 align:start position:0%
so I think just a quick follow-up
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
question to the you know uh occasional
 
01:46:21.649 --> 01:46:21.659 align:start position:0%
inability to collect dolls and that
 
01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
suspension of driver's license is a
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
mechanism to collect that
 
01:46:27.530 --> 01:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
it's something that you know I always
 
01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:29.820 align:start position:0%
struggled with as a matter of policy
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
because it has a lot of negative impacts
 
01:46:31.679 --> 01:46:33.310 align:start position:0%
because it has a lot of negative impacts
would

01:46:33.310 --> 01:46:33.320 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:46:35.629 --> 01:46:35.639 align:start position:0%
similar you know result would be
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
obtained by for example not suspending a
 
01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:39.780 align:start position:0%
driver's license but tacking on the
 
01:46:41.930 --> 01:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
unpaid toll fees to say the registration
 
01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
next year obviously that would work less
 
01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
for people out of state but I'm just
 
01:46:48.649 --> 01:46:48.659 align:start position:0%
trying to see if the department would
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
have any thoughts on what may achieve
 
01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
the same goals in a less you know
 
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
punitive or
 
01:46:56.450 --> 01:46:56.460 align:start position:0%
harmful manner you know even though that
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
should be paid I mean I'm not a fan of
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
anybody who doesn't pay
 
01:47:06.290 --> 01:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
um I I think by the by the uh I think by
 
01:47:08.590 --> 01:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
default by the suspension of of of
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
registration privileges it does get to
 
01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
that um I don't know if uh there would
 
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
be the authority to
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
tack on those those costs to their to
 
01:47:20.930 --> 01:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
their registration fee I mean the
 
01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
registration fees are set in statute and
 
01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
things statutes would need to be
 
01:47:26.570 --> 01:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
adjusted I'm just asking in terms of
 
01:47:28.370 --> 01:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on whether that would be a
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know feasible approach and I know
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to speak you know right I
 
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
think by default I think by de facto
 
01:47:35.570 --> 01:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
that's what we that's what we try to get
 
01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:36.290 align:start position:0%
that's what we that's what we try to get
at

01:47:36.290 --> 01:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
um by the revocation of their um
 
01:47:41.570 --> 01:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
registration privileges they can't
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
register the vehicle on until they you
 
01:47:46.129 --> 01:47:46.139 align:start position:0%
know until they pay those fines so thank
 
01:47:46.139 --> 01:47:47.870 align:start position:0%
know until they pay those fines so thank
you

01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:47:51.229 --> 01:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
the quick question about housing
 
01:47:53.450 --> 01:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
um work the cost of houses
 
01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire it's
 
01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:56.570 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire it's
extraordinary

01:47:56.570 --> 01:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
extraordinary
 
01:47:58.490 --> 01:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
um it this has to be impacting your
 
01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:00.350 align:start position:0%
um it this has to be impacting your
folks

01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
so that's something that that we really
 
01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
need to work on
 
01:48:07.510 --> 01:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking yeah
 
01:48:09.470 --> 01:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
I couldn't provide you more than
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
anecdotal data but uh I think both Dave
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
and I were up in the North Country not
 
01:48:16.010 --> 01:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
too long ago talking to some of our
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
Highway maintainers who had to leave
 
01:48:19.010 --> 01:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
their hometowns because they could no
 
01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
longer afford to live there
 
01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:22.739 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's heartbreaking and these are
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
and it also adds to their days and it
 
01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
means they're taken on second and third
 
01:48:29.810 --> 01:48:29.820 align:start position:0%
jobs there was I'll I'll provide you
 
01:48:33.169 --> 01:48:33.179 align:start position:0%
just a a a small anecdote from from that
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
same visit from a different person who
 
01:48:39.470 --> 01:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
is doing a full shift at Amazon
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
getting off that shift and coming to
 
01:48:44.209 --> 01:48:44.219 align:start position:0%
plow our roads now is that safe
 
01:48:44.219 --> 01:48:45.410 align:start position:0%
plow our roads now is that safe
no

01:48:45.410 --> 01:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
it's not it's what this person has to do
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
to put food on the table and put a roof
 
01:48:51.530 --> 01:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
over their head so yeah there's there's
 
01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that that would benefit
 
01:48:56.450 --> 01:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
from being addressed in that whole
 
01:48:56.460 --> 01:48:58.850 align:start position:0%
from being addressed in that whole
scenario

01:48:58.850 --> 01:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
scenario
 
01:49:01.609 --> 01:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
thank you um if it were possible I'd be
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
curious to know what we would need in
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
order to be competitive with Maine or
 
01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.410 align:start position:0%
order to be competitive with Maine or
Vermont

01:49:06.410 --> 01:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
01:49:07.490 --> 01:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that's you know a
 
01:49:08.689 --> 01:49:08.699 align:start position:0%
number that you would have but how much
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
money would you need in order to pay
 
01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:12.600 align:start position:0%
comparably with the other states and
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
this is totally an embarrassing Pre-K
 
01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:16.250 align:start position:0%
this is totally an embarrassing Pre-K
question

01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:49:16.260 --> 01:49:17.209 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:19.729 --> 01:49:19.739 align:start position:0%
at what level do you set your hourly
 
01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
rates as I know we give you a budget but
 
01:49:23.209 --> 01:49:23.219 align:start position:0%
then there's a big gap between us giving
 
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
you this budget money and you deciding
 
01:49:28.850 --> 01:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
to pay this much money for the snowplow
 
01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:30.229 align:start position:0%
to pay this much money for the snowplow
person

01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
um what flexibility do you have in terms
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
of how much you're able to pay your
 
01:49:34.679 --> 01:49:39.109 align:start position:0%
of how much you're able to pay your
people

01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
um we we have very little flexibility in
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
how much uh we are so so we are bound by
 
01:49:47.570 --> 01:49:47.580 align:start position:0%
the state classification system
 
01:49:50.209 --> 01:49:50.219 align:start position:0%
um we're all fit into that in terms of
 
01:49:50.219 --> 01:49:51.590 align:start position:0%
um we're all fit into that in terms of
that

01:49:51.590 --> 01:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:53.689 --> 01:49:53.699 align:start position:0%
um there are
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
there is a um there is an effort
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
underway through dop to uh revamp the
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
state classification system and
 
01:50:02.149 --> 01:50:02.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully in the future
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
tie it more closely to
 
01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:05.990 align:start position:0%
tie it more closely to
um

01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:06.669 align:start position:0%
um
um

01:50:06.669 --> 01:50:06.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:09.980 align:start position:0%
standardized classes so that we could
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
more readily compare how State wages
 
01:50:17.689 --> 01:50:17.699 align:start position:0%
for certain classifications of work
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
compared natural and compare regionally
 
01:50:23.270 --> 01:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
or nationally to Department of Labor
 
01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:25.020 align:start position:0%
Statistics so
 
01:50:31.850 --> 01:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your attention I know
 
01:50:35.090 --> 01:50:35.100 align:start position:0%
it's a long couple hours but hopefully
 
01:50:36.890 --> 01:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
we answered all your questions and uh
 
01:50:38.450 --> 01:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
we're very thankful for the opportunity
 
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:41.400 align:start position:0%

foreign

03:02:10.570 --> 03:02:10.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:13.309 --> 03:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
okay so one o'clock we'll
 
03:02:15.410 --> 03:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
we'll published as a one o'clock start
 
03:02:17.389 --> 03:02:17.399 align:start position:0%
so we'll start at one o'clock
 
03:02:19.130 --> 03:02:19.140 align:start position:0%
it's a good
 
03:02:21.550 --> 03:02:21.560 align:start position:0%
well you learned from the meeting huh
 
03:02:24.769 --> 03:02:24.779 align:start position:0%
they told us
 
03:02:30.309 --> 03:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:33.290 --> 03:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah he gets too and actually
 
03:02:36.170 --> 03:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
probably he gets three because uh okay
 
03:02:39.250 --> 03:02:39.260 align:start position:0%
no well no
 
03:02:42.650 --> 03:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
I know but he could have he could yeah
 
03:02:44.870 --> 03:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
that actual most was for he didn't have
 
03:02:46.969 --> 03:02:46.979 align:start position:0%
to have two women oh that's only for
 
03:02:48.950 --> 03:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
public hearings what we're doing all the
 
03:02:51.830 --> 03:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
ones we get from the uh Commissioners is
 
03:02:54.889 --> 03:02:54.899 align:start position:0%
is I have a pile and put it in file just

that resume
um

03:03:05.650 --> 03:03:05.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:09.530 --> 03:03:09.540 align:start position:0%

well good afternoon
 
03:03:28.070 --> 03:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
um everyone my name is Bob Quinn I'm the
 
03:03:29.269 --> 03:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of Safety
 
03:03:31.670 --> 03:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
with me here today is Steve Lavoy the
 
03:03:33.889 --> 03:03:33.899 align:start position:0%
director of administration
 
03:03:36.110 --> 03:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
um just to get us started here uh
 
03:03:38.269 --> 03:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
director Lavoy has put together what I
 
03:03:40.910 --> 03:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
believe is very comprehensive uh but
 
03:03:43.370 --> 03:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
narrow and defined scope of what our
 
03:03:45.889 --> 03:03:45.899 align:start position:0%
agency does our seven divisions and I
 
03:03:47.870 --> 03:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
will just open with and I think
 
03:03:49.490 --> 03:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
everybody knows the mission of the
 
03:03:51.110 --> 03:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety is to continually
 
03:03:53.990 --> 03:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
enhance the safety security and quality
 
03:03:55.550 --> 03:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
of life in New Hampshire through
 
03:03:57.469 --> 03:03:57.479 align:start position:0%
professional collaborative and
 
03:03:59.510 --> 03:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
Innovative service to all and what
 
03:04:01.250 --> 03:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
guides our mission is our vision which
 
03:04:04.130 --> 03:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
is to make New Hampshire the safest
 
03:04:06.110 --> 03:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
state in the nation with the highest
 
03:04:08.389 --> 03:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
quality of life for all what I am going
 
03:04:11.450 --> 03:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
to do is um I am going to turn it over
 
03:04:13.730 --> 03:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
to director Lavoy he's going to go
 
03:04:16.490 --> 03:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
through division by division we'll have
 
03:04:18.590 --> 03:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
a time for questions after each one but
 
03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
again we want to be um respectful of
 
03:04:22.070 --> 03:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
your time
 
03:04:23.450 --> 03:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
great thank you commissioner good

afternoon everybody

um so on page three of the presentation
 
03:04:29.030 --> 03:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
here we have an overview of the
 
03:04:31.969 --> 03:04:31.979 align:start position:0%
Department of safety's structure and so
 
03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
as you can see there are seven divisions
 
03:04:36.290 --> 03:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
within the department each with a
 
03:04:38.809 --> 03:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
specific Public Safety Mission and then
 
03:04:39.889 --> 03:04:39.899 align:start position:0%
the office of the commissioner that
 
03:04:41.870 --> 03:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
provides leadership and oversight over
 
03:04:44.990 --> 03:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
those divisions what's important to note
 
03:04:46.429 --> 03:04:46.439 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk a little bit about this
 
03:04:48.889 --> 03:04:48.899 align:start position:0%
today is that each of the divisions is
 
03:04:51.290 --> 03:04:51.300 align:start position:0%
funded very uniquely and there are lots
 
03:04:52.670 --> 03:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
of different sources of funds that
 
03:04:54.830 --> 03:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
support Public Safety in the state and
 
03:04:56.210 --> 03:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll touch on that a little
 
03:04:58.130 --> 03:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
bit today but that'll be in more detail
 
03:05:01.429 --> 03:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
when we get into the budget discussions
 
03:05:01.439 --> 03:05:09.170 align:start position:0%
when we get into the budget discussions
actually

03:05:09.170 --> 03:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:11.450 --> 03:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
so page four we'll start with the office
 
03:05:12.769 --> 03:05:12.779 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner and the office
 
03:05:14.450 --> 03:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
provides executive leadership and
 
03:05:16.429 --> 03:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
direction to all seven divisions of the
 
03:05:17.990 --> 03:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety
 
03:05:20.030 --> 03:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
on page five it shows the structure
 
03:05:21.410 --> 03:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
within the office of the commissioner
 
03:05:23.110 --> 03:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
you can see the Commissioner's Office
 
03:05:26.570 --> 03:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
includes the office of Highway Safety uh
 
03:05:28.130 --> 03:05:28.140 align:start position:0%
the legal unit and the Bureau of
 
03:05:29.809 --> 03:05:29.819 align:start position:0%
hearings we also have two assistant
 
03:05:32.929 --> 03:05:32.939 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that assist in ensuring
 
03:05:34.190 --> 03:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
that we have proper direction and
 
03:05:37.190 --> 03:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
support as a department as a whole
 
03:05:39.590 --> 03:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
on page six here are some highlights
 
03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
from the Commissioner's Office direct
 
03:05:43.250 --> 03:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
report areas so the office of Highway
 
03:05:45.290 --> 03:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
Safety develops and implements Statewide
 
03:05:47.389 --> 03:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
highway safety programs designed to
 
03:05:49.309 --> 03:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
reduce traffic crashes and with the
 
03:05:50.990 --> 03:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
resulting deaths injuries and property
 
03:05:52.790 --> 03:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
damage and they administer the highway
 
03:05:54.590 --> 03:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
safety Federal grant program and that
 
03:05:56.450 --> 03:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
funds a lot of additional overtime
 
03:05:58.429 --> 03:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
patrols for enforcement activities at
 
03:06:00.290 --> 03:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
the local level
 
03:06:02.030 --> 03:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
there's a public information officer
 
03:06:03.469 --> 03:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
which ensures timely consistent
 
03:06:05.809 --> 03:06:05.819 align:start position:0%
messaging on all Department activities
 
03:06:07.670 --> 03:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
and then the legal unit provides legal
 
03:06:09.410 --> 03:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
services to all divisions and programs
 
03:06:10.790 --> 03:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
within the department
 
03:06:13.550 --> 03:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking Council on administrative
 
03:06:16.370 --> 03:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
rulemaking labor issues civil
 
03:06:18.230 --> 03:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
liabilities right to no requests and
 
03:06:19.910 --> 03:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
also ensuring that
 
03:06:21.830 --> 03:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
um we're following all federal state
 
03:06:24.290 --> 03:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
laws and regulations
 
03:06:25.910 --> 03:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
and finally under the office of the
 
03:06:27.769 --> 03:06:27.779 align:start position:0%
commissioner is the Bureau of hearings
 
03:06:30.230 --> 03:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
and this unit conducts Administrative
 
03:06:32.510 --> 03:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
Hearings criminal prosecution and select
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
circuit courts litigation of hearings
 
03:06:36.410 --> 03:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
appeals and also oversees the New
 
03:06:37.849 --> 03:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Motor Vehicle Industry Board
 
03:06:40.070 --> 03:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
they're conducting hearings in person
 
03:06:42.830 --> 03:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
and by video
 
03:06:44.510 --> 03:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
and over the course of a year they
 
03:06:46.969 --> 03:06:46.979 align:start position:0%
conduct over 14 000 hearings and
 
03:06:52.969 --> 03:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:54.410 --> 03:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
on page seven
 
03:06:54.420 --> 03:06:55.130 align:start position:0%
on page seven
um

03:06:55.130 --> 03:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:57.650 --> 03:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
page seven shows the funding for the
 
03:07:00.349 --> 03:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
office of the commissioner the FY 22
 
03:07:03.710 --> 03:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
actual FY 23 adjusted authorized budget
 
03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
and then the agency phase requests for
 
03:07:08.870 --> 03:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 and so again these are here
 
03:07:10.730 --> 03:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
really just to give you a framework of
 
03:07:12.469 --> 03:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
how each one of our divisions is funded
 
03:07:14.690 --> 03:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
we'll go into more detail once we're
 
03:07:16.670 --> 03:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
speaking to the governor's budget but
 
03:07:17.750 --> 03:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
the office of the commissioner has
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
funded predominantly for operations by
 
03:07:21.950 --> 03:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
Highway and general funds the federal
 
03:07:24.469 --> 03:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
funding here represents primarily grants
 
03:07:25.910 --> 03:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
to locals through the office of Highway
 
03:07:28.070 --> 03:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
Safety and the homeland security grant
 
03:07:28.080 --> 03:07:33.410 align:start position:0%
Safety and the homeland security grant
program

03:07:33.410 --> 03:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:35.630 --> 03:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
there any questions about the office of
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
the commissioner in the areas there so
 
03:07:37.439 --> 03:07:39.050 align:start position:0%
the commissioner in the areas there so
far

03:07:39.050 --> 03:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
far
 
03:07:39.060 --> 03:07:41.150 align:start position:0%
far
okay

03:07:41.150 --> 03:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:07:42.410 --> 03:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
moving on to the division of
 
03:07:42.420 --> 03:07:43.870 align:start position:0%
moving on to the division of
administration

03:07:43.870 --> 03:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
administration
 
03:07:45.769 --> 03:07:45.779 align:start position:0%
the mission of the division of
 
03:07:47.269 --> 03:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
administration is to improve Public
 
03:07:49.070 --> 03:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
Safety by providing the highest quality
 
03:07:50.809 --> 03:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
Support Services to the Department of
 
03:07:52.969 --> 03:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
Safety and its divisions in the areas of
 
03:07:54.710 --> 03:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue collection expenditure reporting
 
03:07:57.050 --> 03:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
and management of Human Resources grants
 
03:07:59.330 --> 03:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
budgets and Assets in the picture here
 
03:08:01.130 --> 03:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
on slide 8 these are members of our road
 
03:08:05.330 --> 03:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
toll Bureau at the Sprague terminal over
 
03:08:07.370 --> 03:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth on top of one of the large
 
03:08:10.190 --> 03:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
tanks that stores the fuel product when
 
03:08:13.910 --> 03:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:16.370 --> 03:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
page 9 shows our administer our the
 
03:08:18.050 --> 03:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
structure of the dear division of
 
03:08:20.090 --> 03:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
administration which is comprised of six
 
03:08:20.100 --> 03:08:21.590 align:start position:0%
administration which is comprised of six
bureaus

03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
bureaus
 
03:08:23.929 --> 03:08:23.939 align:start position:0%
um again Financial Human Resources
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
dealing with inventory Asset Management
 
03:08:28.849 --> 03:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
Road till Bureau which collects the
 
03:08:31.070 --> 03:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
state's gas Tax Grants management
 
03:08:33.050 --> 03:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
responsible for compliance over federal
 
03:08:34.910 --> 03:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
grants and the facilities management
 
03:08:37.190 --> 03:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
Bureau which ensures that we fund all of
 
03:08:38.929 --> 03:08:38.939 align:start position:0%
uh that we properly maintain all of our
 
03:08:38.939 --> 03:08:47.870 align:start position:0%
uh that we properly maintain all of our
facilities

03:08:47.870 --> 03:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:51.650 --> 03:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
see that you've got 85 classified and
 
03:08:53.450 --> 03:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
two unclassified
 
03:08:55.610 --> 03:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
um how is your
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
um Are You full staffed or are you down
 
03:09:01.730 --> 03:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
like everybody else or what's your
 
03:09:05.650 --> 03:09:05.660 align:start position:0%
employment situation yeah so um
 
03:09:08.450 --> 03:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
our within the division is similar to
 
03:09:10.250 --> 03:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
the department as a whole our vacancy
 
03:09:14.510 --> 03:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
rates are right around 16 to 17 percent
 
03:09:17.210 --> 03:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
um some bureaus are fully staffed some
 
03:09:19.429 --> 03:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
have one or two vacancies others were
 
03:09:21.950 --> 03:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
struggling to find individuals to fill
 
03:09:24.910 --> 03:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
in this division in particular the the
 
03:09:27.650 --> 03:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
road till Bureau Auditors is a section
 
03:09:29.090 --> 03:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
that we're struggling to find qualified
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
candidates most of our other bureaus
 
03:09:33.290 --> 03:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
were were successful in hiring new
 
03:09:34.910 --> 03:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
people that's not to say we have seen
 
03:09:37.730 --> 03:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
hiring pick up over the last I'd say
 
03:09:39.469 --> 03:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
three or four months
 
03:09:41.269 --> 03:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
um prior to that it was very very
 
03:09:44.389 --> 03:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
challenging but we are hiring at a at a
 
03:09:46.309 --> 03:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
higher rate than we have previously and
 
03:09:48.349 --> 03:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
we're starting to recover those those
 
03:09:51.230 --> 03:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
roles just to add to that representative
 
03:09:53.929 --> 03:09:53.939 align:start position:0%
so weekly Steve's team sends out a
 
03:09:56.210 --> 03:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
dashboard which shows what are our
 
03:09:58.130 --> 03:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
vacancies across the seven divisions so
 
03:09:59.870 --> 03:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
we can really look and see where do we
 
03:10:02.510 --> 03:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
need to increase our recruiting or and
 
03:10:04.610 --> 03:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
then we ask the question why why are
 
03:10:06.050 --> 03:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
these positions harder to filled another
 
03:10:09.050 --> 03:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
so as to director of The Voice we we are
 
03:10:12.410 --> 03:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:14.870 --> 03:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
and I think a few other areas in the
 
03:10:16.370 --> 03:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
department I mean I know we'll get to
 
03:10:19.070 --> 03:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
the divisions but under the HR umbrella
 
03:10:22.130 --> 03:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
um Troopers so Troopers are a concern
 
03:10:23.990 --> 03:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
um you know right now there are 64
 
03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:25.370 align:start position:0%
um you know right now there are 64
vacancies

03:10:25.370 --> 03:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
03:10:28.670 --> 03:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
um in State Police uh there were 10
 
03:10:30.530 --> 03:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
hires that just came on board last
 
03:10:33.290 --> 03:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
Friday and then we have
 
03:10:36.590 --> 03:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
um well over 57 individuals who have
 
03:10:38.690 --> 03:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
signed up to take the exam this month
 
03:10:41.210 --> 03:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
and that number is increasing so again
 
03:10:43.130 --> 03:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
we're seeing that same Trend in all
 
03:10:44.929 --> 03:10:44.939 align:start position:0%
areas where there's increased interest
 
03:10:47.929 --> 03:10:47.939 align:start position:0%
in in applicants that we haven't seen
 
03:10:49.550 --> 03:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
for some time
 
03:10:51.349 --> 03:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh the other area that's that's

capital projects related to our

03:12:53.929 --> 03:12:53.939 align:start position:0%
licensees

they also license oil discharge and
 
03:13:00.230 --> 03:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control licensees as well and
 
03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's on behalf of Environmental
 
03:13:03.950 --> 03:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
Services since there's a lot of overlap
 
03:13:05.750 --> 03:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
between those customers that's a service
 
03:13:09.290 --> 03:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
we provide for Environmental Services
 
03:13:10.849 --> 03:13:10.859 align:start position:0%
there's also the audit function which I
 
03:13:12.290 --> 03:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
mentioned which we saw the photograph of
 
03:13:14.870 --> 03:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
some of our staff 108 audits conducted
 
03:13:17.389 --> 03:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
5.6 million audited and a hundred and
 
03:13:19.070 --> 03:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars assessed the
 
03:13:20.570 --> 03:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
importance of that function is that
 
03:13:22.490 --> 03:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
we're ensuring and trying to promote
 
03:13:24.410 --> 03:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
voluntary compliance
 
03:13:27.469 --> 03:13:27.479 align:start position:0%
um if you're not looking people tend to
 
03:13:29.630 --> 03:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
take Liberties and so the fact that
 
03:13:31.070 --> 03:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
we're looking is critical it's not so
 
03:13:33.410 --> 03:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
much the revenue that we generate
 
03:13:35.570 --> 03:13:35.580 align:start position:0%
Human Resources management very clear of
 
03:13:37.730 --> 03:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
course oh yeah
 
03:13:37.740 --> 03:13:39.349 align:start position:0%
course oh yeah
okay

03:13:39.349 --> 03:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:13:40.490 --> 03:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:13:42.530 --> 03:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
um I think if I recall correctly in the
 
03:13:43.910 --> 03:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
last biennium
 
03:13:46.130 --> 03:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
there was money and I don't know if it
 
03:13:47.929 --> 03:13:47.939 align:start position:0%
was from us or from federal but to help
 
03:13:50.690 --> 03:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
local law enforcements with body cameras
 
03:13:53.929 --> 03:13:53.939 align:start position:0%
can you speak to Halls using the body
 
03:13:56.030 --> 03:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
cameras now both at your level and also
 
03:13:57.469 --> 03:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
what you know about it being used at
 
03:14:00.050 --> 03:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
state and local or local levels
 
03:14:03.170 --> 03:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so um what what I can say now
 
03:14:04.730 --> 03:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
representative is that all of the New
 
03:14:05.990 --> 03:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police are up and
 
03:14:08.450 --> 03:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
running with the body cameras I can
 
03:14:11.389 --> 03:14:11.399 align:start position:0%
provide a list after of you know which
 
03:14:13.250 --> 03:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
departments have
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
um been given Grant dollars and and
 
03:14:18.590 --> 03:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
again we we still have there's money
 
03:14:20.269 --> 03:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
available I think we have approximately
 
03:14:23.150 --> 03:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
600 000 left so
 
03:14:25.309 --> 03:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
um the grants management team has put it
 
03:14:28.790 --> 03:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
out to the public but again we can only
 
03:14:30.830 --> 03:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
make the funds available but if you
 
03:14:32.990 --> 03:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
would like a list of you know who has
 
03:14:37.070 --> 03:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
participated in that and I we will
 
03:14:38.929 --> 03:14:38.939 align:start position:0%
provide that information I think some of
 
03:14:39.950 --> 03:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
that might have to come from police
 
03:14:42.050 --> 03:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
standards and training
 
03:14:43.849 --> 03:14:43.859 align:start position:0%
that's you know I would not spend a lot
 
03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
of extra time on that that's okay but we
 
03:14:47.090 --> 03:14:47.100 align:start position:0%

to the Department of Safety DMV board so
 
03:17:23.990 --> 03:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's really been a nice a nice addition
 
03:17:27.410 --> 03:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:29.870 --> 03:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
I just want to say Kudos on your great
 
03:17:32.809 --> 03:17:32.819 align:start position:0%
electronic system to renew your licenses
 
03:17:36.170 --> 03:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
I just am so impressed how easy it is to
 
03:17:38.809 --> 03:17:38.819 align:start position:0%
get in and get it done
 
03:17:40.250 --> 03:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
um I hope maybe we can share that
 
03:17:50.990 --> 03:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
conversation

03:17:57.410 --> 03:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:59.929 --> 03:17:59.939 align:start position:0%
yeah no no thank you and and that's
 
03:18:02.330 --> 03:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
that's really been a focus for DMV
 
03:18:04.370 --> 03:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
um it's if you think about it I don't
 
03:18:06.349 --> 03:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
know that there's any other area of
 
03:18:08.870 --> 03:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
state government that impacts so many
 
03:18:08.880 --> 03:18:10.250 align:start position:0%
state government that impacts so many
residents

03:18:10.250 --> 03:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
residents
 
03:18:12.530 --> 03:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
um and there's a lot of volume that
 
03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
flows through that operation and the
 
03:18:16.309 --> 03:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
focus is on customer service you know
 
03:18:18.349 --> 03:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
how do we get the transaction process
 
03:18:20.090 --> 03:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
that we need to have processed for the
 
03:18:20.100 --> 03:18:21.290 align:start position:0%
that we need to have processed for the
customer

03:18:21.290 --> 03:18:21.300 align:start position:0%
customer
 
03:18:23.990 --> 03:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
um technology is one answer and and
 
03:18:26.030 --> 03:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
limiting the number of people who have
 
03:18:27.830 --> 03:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
to come in person helps to speed that
 
03:18:29.929 --> 03:18:29.939 align:start position:0%
process along and so we are always
 
03:18:31.969 --> 03:18:31.979 align:start position:0%
looking at new opportunities to expand
 
03:18:34.429 --> 03:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
on that and we'll continue to do so so
 
03:18:36.050 --> 03:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to hear that it's working out
 
03:18:39.230 --> 03:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
as a satisfied user I just renewed my
 
03:18:39.240 --> 03:18:40.250 align:start position:0%
as a satisfied user I just renewed my
license

03:18:40.250 --> 03:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:18:43.429 --> 03:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh I got the letter with the code went
 
03:18:47.750 --> 03:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
in and it was 10 minutes tops yep Kudos
 
03:18:52.670 --> 03:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:54.710 --> 03:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh so on this page we see the DMV
 
03:18:57.290 --> 03:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
structure um which is broken into uh
 
03:18:58.610 --> 03:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
several bureaus Bureau of driver
 
03:19:00.610 --> 03:19:00.620 align:start position:0%

the registration Bureau process is over

03:19:59.330 --> 03:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
processes DMV transactions at 14
 
03:20:01.969 --> 03:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
locations across New Hampshire they
 
03:20:05.510 --> 03:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
field 412 000 customer calls they also
 
03:20:07.130 --> 03:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
are processing on the back end those
 
03:20:09.530 --> 03:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
online transactions that require some
 
03:20:13.490 --> 03:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
additional action by those folks
 
03:20:17.150 --> 03:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
on page 15 we show up yeah
 
03:20:19.849 --> 03:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
thank you what there was talk before
 
03:20:22.070 --> 03:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
that some of the DMV locations had to
 
03:20:23.510 --> 03:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
close because they weren't being used
 
03:20:26.570 --> 03:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
can you speak to where you are on the
 
03:20:29.269 --> 03:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
DMV locations or am I misremembering or
 
03:20:34.790 --> 03:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
every every DMV location is open yep
 
03:20:39.349 --> 03:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
the DMV is funded by Costa collections
 
03:20:41.389 --> 03:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
um and so you can see that that's the
 
03:20:43.370 --> 03:20:43.380 align:start position:0%
vast majority of their funding there's
 
03:20:45.110 --> 03:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
some other funds in there those are some
 
03:20:46.730 --> 03:20:46.740 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds the plate fund
 
03:20:48.410 --> 03:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
motorcycle rider training and then
 
03:20:50.269 --> 03:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
driver education as well but that's
 
03:20:52.070 --> 03:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
small dollars it's really you know 30
 
03:20:54.290 --> 03:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
million dollars in approximately 30
 
03:20:57.349 --> 03:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Costa collections on
 
03:20:57.359 --> 03:20:58.309 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Costa collections on
page

03:20:58.309 --> 03:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
page
 
03:21:01.849 --> 03:21:01.859 align:start position:0%
16 we have an excerpt from
 
03:21:04.750 --> 03:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
the State Constitution and rsa99
 
03:21:06.889 --> 03:21:06.899 align:start position:0%
defining what Costa collections are
 
03:21:09.050 --> 03:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
essentially it's it's the cost of
 
03:21:10.730 --> 03:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
collecting the highway fund revenues
 
03:21:12.530 --> 03:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
before those revenues hit the highway
 
03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
fund so the DMV is authorized to recover
 
03:21:17.570 --> 03:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
their operating costs whatever's left
 
03:21:18.830 --> 03:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
from those collections that we just
 
03:21:20.330 --> 03:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
spoke about is transferred into the
 
03:21:23.870 --> 03:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
highway fund but the statute and the
 
03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
article the Constitution are there just
 
03:21:28.370 --> 03:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
for for your awareness the other area
 
03:21:30.769 --> 03:21:30.779 align:start position:0%
that's funded in this is the road toll
 
03:21:32.030 --> 03:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
Bureau which I mentioned before the
 
03:21:33.530 --> 03:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
state's gas tax so they're funded with
 
03:21:35.330 --> 03:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
cost of Collections and then a small
 
03:21:37.670 --> 03:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
portion of the commissioner's office and
 
03:21:40.010 --> 03:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
the division of administration because
 
03:21:41.690 --> 03:21:41.700 align:start position:0%
of the allocation of those internal and
 
03:21:44.030 --> 03:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
direct costs
 
03:21:50.030 --> 03:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:52.490 --> 03:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
you spoke thank you Mr chair you spoke
 
03:21:53.570 --> 03:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
earlier about
 
03:21:55.670 --> 03:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
um the need for technological
 
03:21:58.849 --> 03:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
advancements to shorten the customer
 
03:22:01.610 --> 03:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
um interaction time with the DMV and um
 
03:22:04.190 --> 03:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to ask I know other states
 
03:22:07.969 --> 03:22:07.979 align:start position:0%
have an um invested in
 
03:22:12.170 --> 03:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
remote kiosk machines for various DMV
 
03:22:12.180 --> 03:22:14.030 align:start position:0%
remote kiosk machines for various DMV
low

03:22:14.030 --> 03:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
low
 
03:22:14.040 --> 03:22:15.530 align:start position:0%
low
um

03:22:15.530 --> 03:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:18.830 --> 03:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
like low Personnel needed transactions
 
03:22:20.750 --> 03:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
such as renewing driver's license is
 
03:22:22.130 --> 03:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
that something that's kind of on your
 
03:22:24.110 --> 03:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
radar and you know is that investment
 
03:22:25.969 --> 03:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
just too far out in the future for New
 
03:22:27.290 --> 03:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or is that something you're
 
03:22:30.349 --> 03:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
kind of kicking around so so
 
03:22:33.050 --> 03:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
um we have separate from this
 
03:22:35.870 --> 03:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
presentation there's several ongoing
 
03:22:37.370 --> 03:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
projects that have been funding at the
 
03:22:37.380 --> 03:22:38.690 align:start position:0%
projects that have been funding at the
DMV

03:22:38.690 --> 03:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
DMV
 
03:22:41.870 --> 03:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
um that it that hit the DMV they're very
 
03:22:44.210 --> 03:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
large projects that need a concept
 
03:22:46.490 --> 03:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
document and a team to once we get the
 
03:22:47.990 --> 03:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
fund and get it you know to to
 
03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:49.610 align:start position:0%
fund and get it you know to to
completion

03:22:49.610 --> 03:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
completion
 
03:22:51.889 --> 03:22:51.899 align:start position:0%
um Mo the ones that that I can think of
 
03:22:53.929 --> 03:22:53.939 align:start position:0%
right now a tail or two
 
03:22:57.410 --> 03:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
um the IRP program you know commercial
 
03:23:00.230 --> 03:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
registrations getting that all online so
 
03:23:02.090 --> 03:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
that you know the they can get their
 
03:23:04.730 --> 03:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
plates and get their updates one of them
 
03:23:07.849 --> 03:23:07.859 align:start position:0%
also touches the plate room so as you
 
03:23:10.910 --> 03:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
see the amount of plates that get
 
03:23:13.429 --> 03:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
requested from the locals and then it's
 
03:23:14.929 --> 03:23:14.939 align:start position:0%
direct to The Voice team that's got to
 
03:23:16.670 --> 03:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
do that so he's looking at automating
 
03:23:19.790 --> 03:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
that I know that director marasco is
 
03:23:22.550 --> 03:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
looking at right now what by Statute has
 
03:23:24.530 --> 03:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
to be done in person there are several
 
03:23:27.050 --> 03:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
transactions that have to to meet Amber
 
03:23:29.809 --> 03:23:29.819 align:start position:0%
standards and real ID but any areas
 
03:23:32.330 --> 03:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
where we can we are looking at that so
 
03:23:35.330 --> 03:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
to the kiosks and I can't speak specific
 
03:23:38.090 --> 03:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
to that but um and and I think to your
 
03:23:39.410 --> 03:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
point that might work in some of the
 
03:23:41.090 --> 03:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
DMVs but they look at metrics like how
 
03:23:42.710 --> 03:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
many customers come in what are the wait
 
03:23:44.570 --> 03:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
times so they they track that every day
 
03:23:46.490 --> 03:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
what's going on in Milford what's going
 
03:23:48.170 --> 03:23:48.180 align:start position:0%
on in Concord what's going on in Epping
 
03:23:50.349 --> 03:23:50.359 align:start position:0%
we have a few that are part-time
 
03:23:52.910 --> 03:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
Haverhill North Haverhill and Colebrook
 
03:23:56.809 --> 03:23:56.819 align:start position:0%
so but but I'll follow up on the kiosks
 
03:23:59.870 --> 03:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
and and it offered to you that um
 
03:24:01.849 --> 03:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
the more transactions that can be
 
03:24:04.550 --> 03:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
performed online regardless of if a
 
03:24:07.190 --> 03:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
kiosk or on your home computer the
 
03:24:07.200 --> 03:24:07.969 align:start position:0%
kiosk or on your home computer the
better

03:24:07.969 --> 03:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
better
 
03:24:10.130 --> 03:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
oftentimes if the customer is coming in
 
03:24:12.769 --> 03:24:12.779 align:start position:0%
they're expecting personal interaction
 
03:24:14.389 --> 03:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
and then if we steer them towards a
 
03:24:16.610 --> 03:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
kiosk or a computer we're somewhat
 
03:24:18.590 --> 03:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
defeating that expectation
 
03:24:20.570 --> 03:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
um but um to your point there's a time
 
03:24:21.889 --> 03:24:21.899 align:start position:0%
and place for all these things and I
 
03:24:23.269 --> 03:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
think that the DMV is doing a good job
 
03:24:25.550 --> 03:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
of considering all the options and
 
03:24:25.560 --> 03:24:26.269 align:start position:0%
of considering all the options and
um

03:24:26.269 --> 03:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:28.490 --> 03:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
being strategic about where we invest
 
03:24:30.229 --> 03:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
our funds to have the the biggest impact
 
03:24:32.990 --> 03:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
where the DMV touches the most
 
03:24:35.990 --> 03:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
I would say constituents of each of
 
03:24:37.670 --> 03:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
yours I think it's important to know too
 
03:24:39.349 --> 03:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
they're looking at all these phone calls
 
03:24:42.110 --> 03:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
and trying to determine how do we how do
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
we educate what we want to make sure is
 
03:24:45.650 --> 03:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
that the customer understands what's
 
03:24:47.929 --> 03:24:47.939 align:start position:0%
needed so we don't want anybody to come
 
03:24:49.429 --> 03:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
to the DMV if they don't have the right
 
03:24:51.110 --> 03:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
paperwork no matter what transaction
 
03:24:52.969 --> 03:24:52.979 align:start position:0%
it's for so that's why we have those
 
03:24:54.530 --> 03:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
greeters and we want to do it online
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
when we start getting a lot of calls
 
03:24:58.250 --> 03:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
like say for example in title we look
 
03:25:00.590 --> 03:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
and say why what is what has got to be
 
03:25:03.349 --> 03:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
cleared up so we've really I will say
 
03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
like the title backlog I'll speak to
 
03:25:06.769 --> 03:25:06.779 align:start position:0%
that specifically we were we were
 
03:25:10.670 --> 03:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
approaching 40 000 in a queue and it's
 
03:25:13.729 --> 03:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
gone down as low as 5800 I think this
 
03:25:16.130 --> 03:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
morning so they're really looking at the
 
03:25:18.410 --> 03:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
process and and again it comes down to
 
03:25:20.690 --> 03:25:20.700 align:start position:0%
making it simple what are we doing
 
03:25:22.610 --> 03:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
online what can we do but just just
 
03:25:24.410 --> 03:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
educating but I know that we've really
 
03:25:27.469 --> 03:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
focused a lot on on the commercial side
 
03:25:27.479 --> 03:25:28.849 align:start position:0%
focused a lot on on the commercial side
because

03:25:28.849 --> 03:25:28.859 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:25:30.290 --> 03:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
um you know these these companies are
 
03:25:31.969 --> 03:25:31.979 align:start position:0%
paying a lot of money for these vehicles
 
03:25:33.590 --> 03:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
and they want to get them at expected
 
03:25:35.030 --> 03:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
and registered and on the road as quick
 
03:25:40.070 --> 03:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:43.910 --> 03:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:46.190 --> 03:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
okay moving on page 17 the division of
 
03:25:48.349 --> 03:25:48.359 align:start position:0%
State Police is dedicated to providing
 
03:25:49.729 --> 03:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
the highest degree of law enforcement
 
03:25:51.290 --> 03:25:51.300 align:start position:0%
Services throughout the state of New
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire while maintaining the
 
03:25:54.290 --> 03:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
traditions of fairness professionalism
 
03:25:56.870 --> 03:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
and integrity
 
03:25:58.849 --> 03:25:58.859 align:start position:0%
this is our largest division and you can
 
03:26:01.490 --> 03:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
see on page 18 from the organizational
 
03:26:04.309 --> 03:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
structure they cover a lot of ground
 
03:26:06.349 --> 03:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
we've got the operations Bureau which
 
03:26:08.090 --> 03:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
are your traditional troop stations
 
03:26:09.769 --> 03:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
splitting the state up geographically
 
03:26:12.170 --> 03:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
there's special services that fall under
 
03:26:14.210 --> 03:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
there the state police the state office
 
03:26:18.170 --> 03:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
complex police force Marine Patrol
 
03:26:21.050 --> 03:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
G which is uh enforcing commercial Motor
 
03:26:22.729 --> 03:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
Vehicle Laws across the state so they
 
03:26:24.229 --> 03:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
have a Statewide Mission as opposed to
 
03:26:26.090 --> 03:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
just within their troop station
 
03:26:27.710 --> 03:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
and then on the right side of the
 
03:26:30.410 --> 03:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
organization there's the investigative
 
03:26:33.010 --> 03:26:33.020 align:start position:0%
in criminal justice information section
 
03:26:35.090 --> 03:26:35.100 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services include the major
 
03:26:37.370 --> 03:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
crime unit narcotics investigations unit
 
03:26:39.710 --> 03:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
special investigations unit terrorism
 
03:26:41.870 --> 03:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
intelligence unit and then the Justice
 
03:26:44.030 --> 03:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
information Bureau this is dealing with
 
03:26:46.570 --> 03:26:46.580 align:start position:0%
criminal records sex offender registry
 
03:26:49.370 --> 03:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
permits and Licensing and also the J-1
 
03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
system which connects the criminal
 
03:26:53.450 --> 03:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
justice system throughout the state so
 
03:26:55.969 --> 03:26:55.979 align:start position:0%
that information is passing between the
 
03:27:00.110 --> 03:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
courts and law enforcement and DMV and
 
03:27:02.090 --> 03:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
and also Corrections electronically
 
03:27:03.710 --> 03:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
instead of pushing paper whenever
 
03:27:05.570 --> 03:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
there's a criminal justice action that's
 
03:27:05.580 --> 03:27:09.830 align:start position:0%
there's a criminal justice action that's
taken

03:27:09.830 --> 03:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:09.840 --> 03:27:11.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

03:27:11.950 --> 03:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:27:14.510 --> 03:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's okay commissioner Quinn is me
 
03:27:16.130 --> 03:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
covered there can you speak a little bit
 
03:27:17.690 --> 03:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
to the mobile enforcement team because
 
03:27:19.370 --> 03:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
there's been the lawsuit there have been
 
03:27:20.450 --> 03:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
some questions around the mobile
 
03:27:22.849 --> 03:27:22.859 align:start position:0%
enforcement team so if you can if I
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're going to do it here
 
03:27:25.610 --> 03:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
or doing it later but an update on the
 
03:27:25.620 --> 03:27:26.929 align:start position:0%
or doing it later but an update on the
Emmy

03:27:26.929 --> 03:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
Emmy
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
shorts uh specifically what would you
 
03:27:32.809 --> 03:27:32.819 align:start position:0%
like represent what would help you can
 
03:27:34.130 --> 03:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
you speak to the there's a current
 
03:27:35.630 --> 03:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
lawsuit right now
 
03:27:38.210 --> 03:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
um with regards to profiling can you
 
03:27:39.950 --> 03:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
speak to is it possible to speak to that
 
03:27:42.590 --> 03:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
well yeah well I can't speak to the to
 
03:27:45.170 --> 03:27:45.180 align:start position:0%
the specific cases but what I can say is
 
03:27:46.550 --> 03:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
what you know what's the mission of the
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
mobile enforcement team you know the
 
03:27:51.050 --> 03:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
mobile enforcement team as as as each of
 
03:27:53.630 --> 03:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
you know we are really seeing an uptick
 
03:27:57.110 --> 03:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
in um in deaths from overdoses uh it's
 
03:27:59.450 --> 03:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
it's no secret that fentanyl is brought
 
03:28:01.969 --> 03:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
into the state you know their mission is
 
03:28:05.150 --> 03:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
to hopefully interdict intercepts stop
 
03:28:06.769 --> 03:28:06.779 align:start position:0%
those drugs before they get into the
 
03:28:09.410 --> 03:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
communities and kill people however they
 
03:28:11.150 --> 03:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
have to continuously be trained and
 
03:28:13.729 --> 03:28:13.739 align:start position:0%
understand state law federal law the
 
03:28:15.530 --> 03:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
Constitution our policy to make sure
 
03:28:18.410 --> 03:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
what they do adheres to that
 
03:28:21.950 --> 03:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
um you know in any of these uh cases no
 
03:28:23.450 --> 03:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
matter what type of criminal case it is
 
03:28:26.870 --> 03:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's a uh a traffic case a DWI a
 
03:28:30.110 --> 03:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
homicide are a mobile enforcement case
 
03:28:32.210 --> 03:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
if evidence is suppressed you know it's
 
03:28:33.830 --> 03:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
always important to look back and see
 
03:28:35.750 --> 03:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
what could be done differently but the
 
03:28:38.870 --> 03:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
mobile enforcement team does does have a
 
03:28:42.170 --> 03:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
mission uh in in our Public Safety
 
03:28:43.910 --> 03:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
um requirements
 
03:28:46.370 --> 03:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
um and uh but we will continually I know
 
03:28:47.650 --> 03:28:47.660 align:start position:0%
that the colonel
 
03:28:50.269 --> 03:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
pays very close attention to this and we
 
03:28:52.490 --> 03:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
continually will will look at whatever
 
03:28:54.769 --> 03:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
oversights needed there and to continue
 
03:28:56.510 --> 03:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
to learn and work with our our
 
03:28:59.630 --> 03:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
prosecutors in these cases yeah it was a
 
03:29:01.969 --> 03:29:01.979 align:start position:0%
great ride-along to do with the Met to
 
03:29:04.610 --> 03:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
go right along with them was really
 
03:29:07.130 --> 03:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
um very educational very interesting
 
03:29:08.690 --> 03:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
will they also pick up on human
 
03:29:08.700 --> 03:29:09.889 align:start position:0%
will they also pick up on human
trafficking

03:29:09.889 --> 03:29:09.899 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
03:29:12.530 --> 03:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
they can all Troopers can we have one
 
03:29:14.389 --> 03:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
trooper I mean I think what's important
 
03:29:17.030 --> 03:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
to understand for everybody every
 
03:29:19.969 --> 03:29:19.979 align:start position:0%
Trooper has the authority to conduct a
 
03:29:22.969 --> 03:29:22.979 align:start position:0%
stop and do it do a search so we want
 
03:29:25.070 --> 03:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
all of our Troopers every Troopa has to
 
03:29:26.510 --> 03:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
understand and they do the colonel does
 
03:29:28.250 --> 03:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
a very good job with that our policies
 
03:29:32.570 --> 03:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
but but the laws change case Law changes
 
03:29:35.210 --> 03:29:35.220 align:start position:0%
but understanding you know when you
 
03:29:37.010 --> 03:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
might have exceeded the scope of the
 
03:29:39.410 --> 03:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
stop or so I guess all Troopers have to
 
03:29:41.570 --> 03:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
be trained to a certain standard they
 
03:29:41.580 --> 03:29:42.429 align:start position:0%
be trained to a certain standard they
are

03:29:42.429 --> 03:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:29:44.990 --> 03:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
case you know evidence will be
 
03:29:47.809 --> 03:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
suppressed it happens and there's a
 
03:29:49.309 --> 03:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
difference I think between doing
 
03:29:51.349 --> 03:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
something that's you know outside of the
 
03:29:53.570 --> 03:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
law and doing something that is
 
03:29:56.090 --> 03:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
suppressed so
 
03:29:58.550 --> 03:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
so that's so so the mobile enforcement
 
03:30:01.370 --> 03:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
team is working and they fall under the
 
03:30:02.570 --> 03:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
oversight of the kernel the New
 
03:30:09.590 --> 03:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:12.889 --> 03:30:12.899 align:start position:0%
just my question is um again it's the um
 
03:30:14.630 --> 03:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
hiring issue
 
03:30:18.469 --> 03:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
um you've got 578 how many actual do you
 
03:30:18.479 --> 03:30:20.630 align:start position:0%
um you've got 578 how many actual do you
have

03:30:20.630 --> 03:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:30:24.229 --> 03:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
so there's of the 578 that's the total
 
03:30:26.269 --> 03:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
Bureau so that includes civilian rules
 
03:30:29.990 --> 03:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
too so there's 360 Trooper positions
 
03:30:31.429 --> 03:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
um that are that are authorized and
 
03:30:33.590 --> 03:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
funded so I and my question is really
 
03:30:35.210 --> 03:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
how many people are you down in that so
 
03:30:39.110 --> 03:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
we're down 64 Troopers okay yeah and
 
03:30:41.690 --> 03:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
what about in the labs and all the other
 
03:30:44.690 --> 03:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
areas that you've got
 
03:30:44.700 --> 03:30:45.969 align:start position:0%
areas that you've got
um

03:30:45.969 --> 03:30:45.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:49.309 --> 03:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
last time yeah then we don't have as
 
03:30:51.889 --> 03:30:51.899 align:start position:0%
many vacancies in in the other areas
 
03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
um those have been recovering like most
 
03:30:56.030 --> 03:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
of our other sections in the department
 
03:30:58.490 --> 03:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
um the Troopers have been a a
 
03:31:01.010 --> 03:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
more challenging recovery because we can
 
03:31:02.870 --> 03:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
only hire new individuals at a certain
 
03:31:04.370 --> 03:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
time during the year they have to go to
 
03:31:05.750 --> 03:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
the academy
 
03:31:08.269 --> 03:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
um all the other positions vacancies we
 
03:31:12.170 --> 03:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:13.790 --> 03:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just a quick
 
03:31:15.530 --> 03:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up in regards to the you know
 
03:31:17.809 --> 03:31:17.819 align:start position:0%
shortage of Troopers
 
03:31:20.269 --> 03:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm you know new on the committee so
 
03:31:22.910 --> 03:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to understand how is
 
03:31:24.769 --> 03:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
this evolving from previous years what's
 
03:31:28.370 --> 03:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
the trend and what is that you could you
 
03:31:30.590 --> 03:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
know do or what support would you need
 
03:31:32.990 --> 03:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
to help you know improve that situation
 
03:31:36.290 --> 03:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
because obviously being down 20 of your
 
03:31:39.550 --> 03:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
staff is a significant burden
 
03:31:42.650 --> 03:31:42.660 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I think a lot has already
 
03:31:45.110 --> 03:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
been done and um there's some more
 
03:31:46.670 --> 03:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
things that are that are in the works
 
03:31:48.889 --> 03:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
and they're all starting to have the
 
03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
desired impact so
 
03:31:51.359 --> 03:31:53.510 align:start position:0%
desired impact so
um

03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:53.520 --> 03:31:55.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:31:55.030 --> 03:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:31:58.250 --> 03:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
we lost a lot of individuals during the
 
03:32:00.050 --> 03:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
pandemic people retired early people
 
03:32:02.090 --> 03:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
made life choices not just in State
 
03:32:04.790 --> 03:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
Police but across the board and so we're
 
03:32:07.010 --> 03:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
still digging out from that
 
03:32:09.889 --> 03:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
um there there is a retention
 
03:32:12.110 --> 03:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
um and recruitment bonus that was
 
03:32:13.849 --> 03:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
approved by the legislature by the
 
03:32:16.610 --> 03:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
council that has been helping to bridge
 
03:32:19.790 --> 03:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
the gap between the cost or not the cost
 
03:32:23.090 --> 03:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
but the pay that locals are offering
 
03:32:26.090 --> 03:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
it's really it comes down to to pay in
 
03:32:28.550 --> 03:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
many cases when an individual if they're
 
03:32:30.849 --> 03:32:30.859 align:start position:0%
choosing to enter the law enforcement
 
03:32:33.170 --> 03:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
they could make more money at a local
 
03:32:34.729 --> 03:32:34.739 align:start position:0%
level than they can at State Police
 
03:32:37.309 --> 03:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
today today
 
03:32:38.630 --> 03:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
um you know there's obviously there's
 
03:32:41.410 --> 03:32:41.420 align:start position:0%
ongoing negotiations with the Union
 
03:32:43.550 --> 03:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
we're assuming there will be some sort
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
of an increase that comes from that you
 
03:32:47.570 --> 03:32:47.580 align:start position:0%
put all those pieces together and it's
 
03:32:50.150 --> 03:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
more attractive to to join State Police
 
03:32:52.070 --> 03:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
in your law enforcement career and to
 
03:32:54.050 --> 03:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
stay with State Police if you're already
 
03:32:56.570 --> 03:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
a member and so by by dealing with both
 
03:32:59.870 --> 03:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
retention and Recruitment and and
 
03:33:02.269 --> 03:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
addressing one-time pay but then also
 
03:33:03.769 --> 03:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
long time pay I think that's that's
 
03:33:06.590 --> 03:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
helping the situation
 
03:33:08.510 --> 03:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
so just as a very quick follow-up I'm
 
03:33:10.370 --> 03:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
from Windham and uh you know you think
 
03:33:12.530 --> 03:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
locals are poaching you we cannot hire
 
03:33:14.929 --> 03:33:14.939 align:start position:0%
police officers either and we've been
 
03:33:16.790 --> 03:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
trying really really hard so the the
 
03:33:19.190 --> 03:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
shortage seems to be systemic and it may
 
03:33:20.870 --> 03:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
affect the state a bit more because of
 
03:33:22.550 --> 03:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
the factories you were describing but
 
03:33:25.250 --> 03:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's not like we have uh the number of
 
03:33:27.710 --> 03:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
officers we'd like to have so it's it's
 
03:33:29.870 --> 03:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
tough overall thank you you know and I
 
03:33:31.670 --> 03:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
think what's important is
 
03:33:34.370 --> 03:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
um you know money is important but I
 
03:33:36.110 --> 03:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
know that the the colonel and his team
 
03:33:39.349 --> 03:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
do a very very good job no matter what
 
03:33:40.729 --> 03:33:40.739 align:start position:0%
the trends are what the year is to make
 
03:33:42.769 --> 03:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
sure that people that do come through
 
03:33:44.330 --> 03:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
our process understand what they're
 
03:33:45.769 --> 03:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
signing up for understand the
 
03:33:47.750 --> 03:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
opportunities but also understand the
 
03:33:49.610 --> 03:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
requirements and the oversight and we
 
03:33:50.750 --> 03:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
get people that are going to want to
 
03:33:52.849 --> 03:33:52.859 align:start position:0%
stay and we can retain them for a career
 
03:33:55.309 --> 03:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
and quite honestly some people might
 
03:33:58.010 --> 03:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
like to go to a a local department or a
 
03:33:59.210 --> 03:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
smaller department or a large Department
 
03:34:01.490 --> 03:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
some folks might like to do you know
 
03:34:04.190 --> 03:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
work in the highway or work it up so I
 
03:34:06.110 --> 03:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
think no matter what's changed we have
 
03:34:09.290 --> 03:34:09.300 align:start position:0%
to stay focused and and and stay the
 
03:34:11.990 --> 03:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
course on our testing and our standards
 
03:34:16.729 --> 03:34:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:18.530 --> 03:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:34:20.630 --> 03:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
I live in Manchester
 
03:34:22.610 --> 03:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
um we have a horrible
 
03:34:26.090 --> 03:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
unhow situation Complicated by the drug
 
03:34:29.690 --> 03:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
situation are your Troopers seeing the
 
03:34:32.450 --> 03:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
same kind of scenarios in other parts of
 
03:34:34.550 --> 03:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
the state and they and how are they
 
03:34:36.170 --> 03:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
dealing with all this
 
03:34:38.570 --> 03:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
I'll take that well first I'll say the
 
03:34:40.670 --> 03:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
the colonel colonel noise has a
 
03:34:41.990 --> 03:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
tremendous relationship with Chief
 
03:34:44.510 --> 03:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
alderberg in Manchester if they need our
 
03:34:46.790 --> 03:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
help we give it if we need their help we
 
03:34:48.830 --> 03:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
give it if we don't we continue to you
 
03:34:50.630 --> 03:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
know do our jobs you know there are I
 
03:34:52.910 --> 03:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
what we do is I would I would encourage
 
03:34:55.070 --> 03:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
everyone here to look at the um the drug
 
03:34:56.870 --> 03:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
monitoring initiative that's posted
 
03:34:59.150 --> 03:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
publicly that the um New Hampshire
 
03:35:00.950 --> 03:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
information and Analysis center pushes
 
03:35:02.330 --> 03:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
out because of what it shows you it
 
03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
shows you what is happening you know in
 
03:35:07.309 --> 03:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
in your towns your your counties but yes
 
03:35:09.290 --> 03:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
we're seeing it we're focusing on you
 
03:35:11.269 --> 03:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
know where where are folks dying and why
 
03:35:14.330 --> 03:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
but um I don't think there's any area of
 
03:35:15.889 --> 03:35:15.899 align:start position:0%
this state that hasn't been touched by
 
03:35:18.050 --> 03:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
the Fentanyl and what we've been dealing
 
03:35:20.809 --> 03:35:20.819 align:start position:0%
with recently is not only uh if you go
 
03:35:24.530 --> 03:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
back a snapshot snapshot of the lab 2010
 
03:35:27.290 --> 03:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
we were dealing with prescription drugs
 
03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
unregulated prescription drug abuse 2012
 
03:35:32.389 --> 03:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going by my memory so don't
 
03:35:35.389 --> 03:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
hold me 2012 we started seeing an uptick
 
03:35:37.550 --> 03:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
in heroin the oxycontinent to heroin
 
03:35:40.490 --> 03:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
then as we address that we and at one
 
03:35:42.830 --> 03:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
point we had two fentanyl items in the
 
03:35:44.809 --> 03:35:44.819 align:start position:0%
lab one was a lollipup and one was a
 
03:35:46.790 --> 03:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
patch diverted from you know from a
 
03:35:49.969 --> 03:35:49.979 align:start position:0%
medical uh issue and then the fentanyl
 
03:35:52.729 --> 03:35:52.739 align:start position:0%
hit and that's when we dealt with
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
fentanyl and carfentanyl and now we're
 
03:35:57.290 --> 03:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
dealing if you you've read
 
03:35:59.570 --> 03:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
um with xylazine which is being added to
 
03:36:02.269 --> 03:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
the fentanally cut so the xylazine can
 
03:36:04.490 --> 03:36:04.500 align:start position:0%
have an adverse effect on the Narcan
 
03:36:08.750 --> 03:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
naloxone so so we I think our folks at
 
03:36:10.729 --> 03:36:10.739 align:start position:0%
the Intelligence and Analysis Center are
 
03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
looking Statewide I think local law
 
03:36:15.710 --> 03:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
enforcements to investigate EMS they're
 
03:36:17.330 --> 03:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
trying their best to deal with it but a
 
03:36:19.010 --> 03:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
lot of this is you know it's enforcement
 
03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
but it's public health too messaging and
 
03:36:24.530 --> 03:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
awareness but but we're seeing it and I
 
03:36:25.550 --> 03:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
think quite honestly we're just doing
 
03:36:28.190 --> 03:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
the best we can with it
 
03:36:33.769 --> 03:36:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:36.050 --> 03:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
on page 19 we've got a listing of
 
03:36:38.510 --> 03:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
service highlights for state police
 
03:36:40.610 --> 03:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
the operations Bureau which provides law
 
03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement Services across seven troops
 
03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
and through Marine Patrol stops 74 671
 
03:36:49.610 --> 03:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles and arrested 753 impaired
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
drivers and conducted a hundred and six

funding and some other funding in this
 
03:38:32.269 --> 03:38:32.279 align:start position:0%
area the majority of that is related to
 
03:38:34.550 --> 03:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
funds for Marine Patrol which are funded

any questions on State Police I I just

have a question about recurring graphs

every graph that we've seen so far 22 to

2022 actual
 
03:38:55.969 --> 03:38:55.979 align:start position:0%
is increased by about 20 percent
 
03:38:58.429 --> 03:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
to authorize is that because of
 
03:39:01.429 --> 03:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
vacancies it is okay yes yeah the vast
 
03:39:03.050 --> 03:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
majority of that is because of vacancies
 
03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
a smaller portion is due to
 
03:39:08.090 --> 03:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
um challenges in receiving equipment
 
03:39:09.410 --> 03:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
that we needed to purchase because of
 
03:39:11.450 --> 03:39:11.460 align:start position:0%

funding which we've experienced
 
03:40:10.250 --> 03:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
significant number of disasters and need
 
03:40:11.809 --> 03:40:11.819 align:start position:0%

03:40:42.050 --> 03:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
03:40:46.250 --> 03:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
when um less Freddy um
 
03:40:49.070 --> 03:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security came there was a FEMA
 
03:40:49.080 --> 03:40:50.750 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security came there was a FEMA
request

03:40:50.750 --> 03:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
request
 
03:40:54.650 --> 03:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
um and in it everything was in a
 
03:40:56.510 --> 03:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
negative because that's how I guess it
 
03:40:59.090 --> 03:40:59.100 align:start position:0%
has to be shown that we have to pay up
 
03:41:02.750 --> 03:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
front now what money does the State of
 
03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire use to pay up front so we
 
03:41:07.370 --> 03:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
can get reimbursed by FEMA how do we do
 
03:41:07.380 --> 03:41:09.530 align:start position:0%
can get reimbursed by FEMA how do we do
that

03:41:09.530 --> 03:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:12.889 --> 03:41:12.899 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm not being clear so um the
 
03:41:15.050 --> 03:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
question is how do we how do we make the
 
03:41:17.210 --> 03:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
appropriation how do we make how do we
 
03:41:19.670 --> 03:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
spend before the funds come in exactly
 
03:41:21.710 --> 03:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
so that item
 
03:41:21.720 --> 03:41:22.729 align:start position:0%
so that item
um

03:41:22.729 --> 03:41:22.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:25.550 --> 03:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
a portion of that item addresses that
 
03:41:25.560 --> 03:41:26.809 align:start position:0%
a portion of that item addresses that
issue

03:41:26.809 --> 03:41:26.819 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:41:28.790 --> 03:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
um we're able to we come to the fiscal
 
03:41:28.800 --> 03:41:29.870 align:start position:0%
um we're able to we come to the fiscal
committee

03:41:29.870 --> 03:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:41:31.490 --> 03:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
um and to the council outside of the
 
03:41:34.330 --> 03:41:34.340 align:start position:0%
budget process and request appropriation
 
03:41:37.370 --> 03:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
spending Authority that spending
 
03:41:41.389 --> 03:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
Authority is theoretically funded by
 
03:41:44.630 --> 03:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
the state treasury so like a loan as a
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
loan right and then those funds we would
 
03:41:48.170 --> 03:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
draw federal funds down for those
 
03:41:50.570 --> 03:41:50.580 align:start position:0%
expenses once they've been made and once
 
03:41:52.429 --> 03:41:52.439 align:start position:0%
we've submitted through the proper
 
03:41:54.110 --> 03:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
paperwork thank you
 
03:41:54.120 --> 03:41:57.290 align:start position:0%
paperwork thank you
um

03:41:57.290 --> 03:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:59.210 --> 03:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
uh the community services section
 
03:42:00.830 --> 03:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
provides Technical and organizational
 
03:42:04.370 --> 03:42:04.380 align:start position:0%

section provides assistance to the
 
03:42:14.510 --> 03:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
communities and state agencies with
 
03:42:16.490 --> 03:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
planning training and exercises
 
03:42:18.050 --> 03:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
associated with responding to
 
03:42:21.530 --> 03:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
radiological events at Seabrook station
 
03:42:23.870 --> 03:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
and finally within that section is the
 
03:42:25.729 --> 03:42:25.739 align:start position:0%
radiological instrumentation maintenance
 
03:42:28.010 --> 03:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
and calibration unit which calibrates
 
03:42:31.010 --> 03:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
and repairs screening equipment for used
 
03:42:33.050 --> 03:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
by the 17 emergency planning zone
 
03:42:35.150 --> 03:42:35.160 align:start position:0%

Regional all Hazard approach to training
 
03:42:44.090 --> 03:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
exercise and development utilizing Grant
 
03:42:45.950 --> 03:42:45.960 align:start position:0%

03:42:47.330 --> 03:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
training opportunities for local
 
03:42:49.670 --> 03:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
partners and stakeholders really their
 
03:42:51.050 --> 03:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
mission is coordinating emergency
 
03:42:53.450 --> 03:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
preparedness and response across the
 
03:42:55.790 --> 03:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
state because we're a small state and
 
03:42:57.530 --> 03:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
when something happens we need to work
 
03:42:59.090 --> 03:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
with our partners at the local County
 
03:43:00.889 --> 03:43:00.899 align:start position:0%
and state levels in order to respond
 
03:43:00.899 --> 03:43:02.769 align:start position:0%
and state levels in order to respond
appropriately

03:43:02.769 --> 03:43:02.779 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
03:43:07.010 --> 03:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
hscm's funding on page 24 is is broken
 
03:43:08.510 --> 03:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
down they're primarily funded with
 
03:43:10.330 --> 03:43:10.340 align:start position:0%
federal funds through the grant programs
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
specifically empg
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
the increase in federal funds that
 
03:43:15.950 --> 03:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
you're seeing over time here really has
 
03:43:17.510 --> 03:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
to do with the disaster grants that we
 
03:43:19.309 --> 03:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
just spoke about those outflows are
 
03:43:20.690 --> 03:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
expected to continue into the next
 
03:43:23.929 --> 03:43:23.939 align:start position:0%
biennium as those reimbursements get
 
03:43:25.610 --> 03:43:25.620 align:start position:0%
processed and then there's some other
 
03:43:27.469 --> 03:43:27.479 align:start position:0%
funding which is predominantly Seabrook
 
03:43:29.450 --> 03:43:29.460 align:start position:0%
assessment funds and then also some
 
03:43:32.929 --> 03:43:32.939 align:start position:0%
internal grants that we hsem receives
 
03:43:35.450 --> 03:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
from a highway safety and Homeland
 
03:43:36.710 --> 03:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
Security through the commissioner's
 
03:43:36.720 --> 03:43:39.170 align:start position:0%
Security through the commissioner's
office

03:43:39.170 --> 03:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:42.050 --> 03:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
any questions on hsem just a very quick
 
03:43:43.790 --> 03:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair I'm looking
 
03:43:46.849 --> 03:43:46.859 align:start position:0%
at the you know budgeted numbers and
 
03:43:49.550 --> 03:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
your budget your budget increased by
 
03:43:51.650 --> 03:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
about 10 percent or so on the federal
 
03:43:55.250 --> 03:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
funding between 22 and 24 and that's
 
03:43:57.469 --> 03:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
actual versus budgeted so you know the
 
03:43:58.969 --> 03:43:58.979 align:start position:0%
increase could be different
 
03:44:01.190 --> 03:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
is that part of those you know grants
 
03:44:03.370 --> 03:44:03.380 align:start position:0%
and numbers that you are talking about
 
03:44:05.690 --> 03:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
is it something that the state may have
 
03:44:08.150 --> 03:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
to pick up if the federal funding dries
 
03:44:09.950 --> 03:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
out or is it just an inflow of federal
 
03:44:11.750 --> 03:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
funds that need to be expanded and then
 
03:44:13.790 --> 03:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
it will return to the Baseline
 
03:44:16.429 --> 03:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
it is um it's Federal funding uh
 
03:44:19.070 --> 03:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
predominantly disaster funding no
 
03:44:21.229 --> 03:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
liability to the state it's really a
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
pass-through of federal funds through us
 
03:44:26.030 --> 03:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
to the locals so it's a temporary thing
 
03:44:28.429 --> 03:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
and at some point it will slow down when
 
03:44:29.630 --> 03:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
03:44:32.750 --> 03:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
yeah correct um I mean the one thing
 
03:44:36.710 --> 03:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
the one thing I'd caution is we're
 
03:44:38.990 --> 03:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
10 years ago we didn't budget for
 
03:44:41.510 --> 03:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
disasters at all so we would only come
 
03:44:43.250 --> 03:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
forward to the fiscal committee when one
 
03:44:47.210 --> 03:44:47.220 align:start position:0%
occurred we now have uh seven open
 
03:44:50.450 --> 03:44:50.460 align:start position:0%
disasters it might be eight seven
 
03:44:52.790 --> 03:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
um and so we're now taking the approach
 
03:44:54.710 --> 03:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
of we're estimating and budgeting the
 
03:44:56.809 --> 03:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
disaster funding so that we can keep the
 
03:44:58.610 --> 03:44:58.620 align:start position:0%
those funds flowing through the system
 
03:45:00.530 --> 03:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
without having to come to fiscal after
 
03:45:03.170 --> 03:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
the fact if a new disaster occurs we'll
 
03:45:04.429 --> 03:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
still need to come to fiscal because
 
03:45:06.969 --> 03:45:06.979 align:start position:0%
this estimate didn't contemplate that
 
03:45:09.950 --> 03:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
so I would expect these numbers to
 
03:45:11.929 --> 03:45:11.939 align:start position:0%
potentially decline over time
 
03:45:14.690 --> 03:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
but the big increase is is predominantly
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
because of the coveted disaster it is
 
03:45:18.590 --> 03:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
eight he was right I'm wrong
 
03:45:23.389 --> 03:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
see it is eight yeah thank you sir
 
03:45:27.229 --> 03:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:29.389 --> 03:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
all right page 25 the division of

03:45:47.690 --> 03:45:47.700 align:start position:0%

03:46:15.290 --> 03:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
call those peace apps those are the call
 
03:46:17.210 --> 03:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
centers in Concord and ones in Laconia
 
03:46:20.090 --> 03:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
they provide 24 7 coverage and they're
 
03:46:22.190 --> 03:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
both operational at the same time so if
 
03:46:24.650 --> 03:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
one goes down the other one is already
 
03:46:27.110 --> 03:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
taking calls it's not a warm site it's
 
03:46:29.269 --> 03:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
they're they're hot sites
 
03:46:33.170 --> 03:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
last year they answered 400 and 181 000
 
03:46:36.349 --> 03:46:36.359 align:start position:0%

Hampshire state police radio system and
 
03:47:34.670 --> 03:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
then the Statewide microwave back hall
 
03:47:36.110 --> 03:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
and all the support facilities
 
03:47:37.610 --> 03:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
associated with those including
 
03:47:39.910 --> 03:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
generators at tower sites
 
03:47:42.530 --> 03:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
they currently support 39 microwave
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
links and 29 transmit receive sites
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
and finally the Bureau of Technology
 
03:47:50.150 --> 03:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
Services maintains the 911 system itself
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
to ensure there's an interrupted call
 
03:47:55.070 --> 03:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
answering and transfer services and then
 
03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
they also maintain the databases that
 
03:47:58.729 --> 03:47:58.739 align:start position:0%
support the telecommunicators so they
 
03:48:00.110 --> 03:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
can direct the calls and direct the
 
03:48:02.210 --> 03:48:02.220 align:start position:0%
services where needed that's the gis
 
03:48:04.190 --> 03:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
system the geographic information system
 
03:48:06.229 --> 03:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
and the automatic location information
 
03:48:09.650 --> 03:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
or the Ali databases currently at our
 
03:48:12.590 --> 03:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
mapping database holds 708 312
 
03:48:14.990 --> 03:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
addressable points across the state so
 
03:48:16.370 --> 03:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
it's really it's important the more
 
03:48:18.110 --> 03:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
points you have the more accurate you
 
03:48:24.769 --> 03:48:24.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chairman
 
03:48:27.359 --> 03:48:27.950 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chairman
um

03:48:27.950 --> 03:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
dead spots you're good how's your
 
03:48:32.510 --> 03:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
coverage I mean uh we I know what the
 
03:48:34.250 --> 03:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
county we have uh matter of fact we're
 
03:48:36.530 --> 03:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
updating our system of Stratford County
 
03:48:39.650 --> 03:48:39.660 align:start position:0%
to uh you know prevent dead spots and
 
03:48:42.530 --> 03:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
obviously we have some very
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
remote locations in New Hampshire
 
03:48:46.450 --> 03:48:46.460 align:start position:0%
especially up in the North Country
 
03:48:46.460 --> 03:48:48.130 align:start position:0%
especially up in the North Country
yeah

03:48:48.130 --> 03:48:48.140 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:48:51.229 --> 03:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
all right I'll you can back clean up
 
03:48:53.570 --> 03:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
I'll take that so we have um we have a
 
03:48:55.250 --> 03:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
position to switch Statewide
 
03:48:56.990 --> 03:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
interoperability coordinator John
 
03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
Stevens who works over there side by
 
03:49:01.130 --> 03:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
side with Mark Doyle who's in charge of
 
03:49:05.210 --> 03:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
uh of desc 9-1-1 so they've got they
 
03:49:07.250 --> 03:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
work with the network engineers and
 
03:49:08.510 --> 03:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking right now they're looking
 
03:49:10.070 --> 03:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
at an upgrade I believe it's in The
 
03:49:12.650 --> 03:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
Troop C area Sullivan County they're
 
03:49:14.690 --> 03:49:14.700 align:start position:0%
also looking at troop F we've been
 
03:49:17.030 --> 03:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
focusing now on the border you know
 
03:49:19.190 --> 03:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
looking for where are the gaps but they
 
03:49:21.710 --> 03:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
are continuously doing that with on our
 
03:49:23.570 --> 03:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
state system the two systems that we
 
03:49:23.580 --> 03:49:24.650 align:start position:0%
state system the two systems that we
have

03:49:24.650 --> 03:49:24.660 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:49:27.729 --> 03:49:27.739 align:start position:0%
um so I think the key to your point is
 
03:49:29.809 --> 03:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
understanding the difference in systems
 
03:49:31.490 --> 03:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
you know we've got our Statewide system
 
03:49:34.010 --> 03:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
we've got b top which you know rides
 
03:49:36.710 --> 03:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
rides around that so you know behind
 
03:49:36.720 --> 03:49:37.809 align:start position:0%
rides around that so you know behind
that

03:49:37.809 --> 03:49:37.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:49:41.570 --> 03:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
but we we are continuously looking at
 
03:49:43.070 --> 03:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
the dead spots and trying to come up
 
03:49:45.229 --> 03:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
with solutions for you know for that but
 
03:49:47.690 --> 03:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
I can tell you the team that we've hired
 
03:49:50.090 --> 03:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
in the last several years are really
 
03:49:52.370 --> 03:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
good we've got some great radio
 
03:49:55.370 --> 03:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
technicians and if there is a spot that
 
03:49:57.229 --> 03:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
they identified not only you know in the
 
03:49:59.150 --> 03:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
mobile but the Portables they're looking
 
03:50:00.889 --> 03:50:00.899 align:start position:0%
for Solutions
 
03:50:02.809 --> 03:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
um but you know a lot of it is uh maybe
 
03:50:04.910 --> 03:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
the solutions there they it could be a
 
03:50:07.370 --> 03:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
training issue but we provide a lot of
 
03:50:09.530 --> 03:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
dollars to support through through the
 
03:50:13.070 --> 03:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
Homeland grants interoperability but the
 
03:50:14.809 --> 03:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
gaps still exist I can't speak to the
 
03:50:16.910 --> 03:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
Stratford County one I'm sure but you
 
03:50:19.010 --> 03:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
know the team meets together in the seek
 
03:50:21.410 --> 03:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
the Statewide you know team that looks
 
03:50:24.410 --> 03:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
at it so I think I think that the gaps
 
03:50:26.929 --> 03:50:26.939 align:start position:0%
are shrinking again there are some you
 
03:50:29.450 --> 03:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
know areas where they need a power
 
03:50:31.429 --> 03:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
source you know it isn't just an antenna
 
03:50:33.290 --> 03:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
but it's so so I think we're I think
 
03:50:34.370 --> 03:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
we're going in the right direction
 
03:50:34.380 --> 03:50:36.229 align:start position:0%
we're going in the right direction
though

03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
though
 
03:50:39.650 --> 03:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
if I may uh I worked in that with State
 
03:50:42.290 --> 03:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
Police and local Stratford County okay
 
03:50:45.950 --> 03:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
in 1969 so and it's it was good then I
 
03:50:47.510 --> 03:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
mean it you know because you a lot of
 
03:50:49.370 --> 03:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
times you worked as a single officer at
 
03:50:51.710 --> 03:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
night and that's all you had
 
03:50:55.610 --> 03:50:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:57.349 --> 03:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I was curious about that too and
 
03:50:59.750 --> 03:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
also as a follow-up because phones are
 
03:51:01.250 --> 03:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
getting better and you're getting fewer
 
03:51:03.830 --> 03:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
dead spots um you're getting more calls
 
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
from hikers basically or campers
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
um have you seen an uptick in that
 
03:51:12.950 --> 03:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
because of an increase in coverage and
 
03:51:16.550 --> 03:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
um who do they Loop in for the search
 
03:51:18.050 --> 03:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
and rescue for people who are in the
 
03:51:20.210 --> 03:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
woods and using 9-1-1 as a way to get
 
03:51:22.729 --> 03:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
help yeah that's a good that's good we
 
03:51:24.889 --> 03:51:24.899 align:start position:0%
we were just talking about that so so
 
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
there's an immediate response if it's
 
03:51:29.450 --> 03:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
like a life safety so we dispatch now we
 
03:51:30.950 --> 03:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous partnership with fish
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
and games so we help them with the
 
03:51:34.610 --> 03:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
dispatch so if it's a dispatch calls for
 
03:51:37.250 --> 03:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
service would go through dispatch if
 
03:51:39.830 --> 03:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's a life safety 9-1-1 you know they
 
03:51:42.410 --> 03:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
would notify that local area and then
 
03:51:44.510 --> 03:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
they follow up with a call to fish and
 
03:51:46.490 --> 03:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
game who handles the rescue so they want
 
03:51:48.410 --> 03:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
to make sure they get immediate response
 
03:51:51.590 --> 03:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
to to that whatever the the emergency is
 
03:51:54.290 --> 03:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
and then they'll call Fish and Game
 
03:51:59.210 --> 03:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:03.110 --> 03:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
but but back to your the metrics so I
 
03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
can't speak as you look at the 911 calls
 
03:52:07.070 --> 03:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
those continually are increasing so
 
03:52:09.830 --> 03:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
you'd have to ask fish and game on how
 
03:52:11.210 --> 03:52:11.220 align:start position:0%
many calls they've been getting for
 
03:52:15.950 --> 03:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:18.229 --> 03:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
page 28 shows the funding for the
 
03:52:19.969 --> 03:52:19.979 align:start position:0%
division of emergency services and
 
03:52:19.979 --> 03:52:21.490 align:start position:0%
division of emergency services and
Communications

03:52:21.490 --> 03:52:21.500 align:start position:0%
Communications
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
they're funded predominantly by the 911
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
fund that's based on a 75 cents per line
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
surcharge for all telephone lines it's
 
03:52:34.190 --> 03:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
wired Wireless Vape lines and there's
 
03:52:37.130 --> 03:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
also a 75 cent surcharge on prepaid
 
03:52:40.250 --> 03:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
cellular cards as well
 
03:52:43.070 --> 03:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
and so that at this point that fund is
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
um been healthy and able to support the
 
03:52:47.870 --> 03:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
operations including adjustments and
 
03:52:53.870 --> 03:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:55.790 --> 03:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
page 29 is the division of fire
 
03:52:57.670 --> 03:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
standards and Emergency Medical Services
 
03:53:00.170 --> 03:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
they're committed to training educating
 
03:53:02.330 --> 03:53:02.340 align:start position:0%
and certifying
 
03:53:04.490 --> 03:53:04.500 align:start position:0%

protect the citizens and visitors of New
 
03:53:07.849 --> 03:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a photo there some
 
03:53:09.410 --> 03:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
firefighters and an active training
 
03:53:09.420 --> 03:53:12.469 align:start position:0%
firefighters and an active training
scenario

03:53:12.469 --> 03:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:15.290 --> 03:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
page 30 shows their structure broken
 
03:53:17.150 --> 03:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
into the Bureau of firefighter training
 
03:53:19.010 --> 03:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services
 
03:53:21.229 --> 03:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of certification and support
 
03:53:22.849 --> 03:53:22.859 align:start position:0%
and then the administrative support
 
03:53:22.859 --> 03:53:25.190 align:start position:0%
and then the administrative support
function

03:53:25.190 --> 03:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
function
 
03:53:27.290 --> 03:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
this bureau there's 40 classified
 
03:53:29.809 --> 03:53:29.819 align:start position:0%
full-time employees for the majority of
 
03:53:31.309 --> 03:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
the activity is going to be with
 
03:53:33.469 --> 03:53:33.479 align:start position:0%
part-time instructors and so we hire
 
03:53:35.570 --> 03:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts people with
 
03:53:37.250 --> 03:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
experience for the certain courses that
 
03:53:38.990 --> 03:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
are being held and that's on a part-time
 
03:53:41.150 --> 03:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
basis and so when we get to the budget
 
03:53:42.349 --> 03:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
section you'll see they have a
 
03:53:46.010 --> 03:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
significant part-time part-time budget
 
03:53:47.809 --> 03:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
the service highlights for the division
 
03:53:50.450 --> 03:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
on page 31 the Bureau of firefighter
 
03:53:52.490 --> 03:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
training they provide all firefighter
 
03:53:54.590 --> 03:53:54.600 align:start position:0%

03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
curriculums
 
03:54:02.870 --> 03:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
they oversee two fire training campuses
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
one in Concord one in Bethlehem
 
03:54:07.670 --> 03:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
training props Vehicles apparatus and
 
03:54:09.229 --> 03:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
Equipment all necessary to conduct the
 
03:54:09.239 --> 03:54:10.550 align:start position:0%
Equipment all necessary to conduct the
trainings

03:54:10.550 --> 03:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
trainings
 
03:54:13.750 --> 03:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
last year they enrolled 20 140 students
 
03:54:17.630 --> 03:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
issued 1 280 certifications and taught
 
03:54:21.469 --> 03:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
897 courses across the state
 
03:54:23.630 --> 03:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum Administration is responsible
 
03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
for planning developing and implementing
 
03:54:27.889 --> 03:54:27.899 align:start position:0%
all curriculums including incorporating
 
03:54:32.809 --> 03:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:35.150 --> 03:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
just a quick question about electric
 
03:54:38.809 --> 03:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
vehicles how are people being trained to
 
03:54:41.030 --> 03:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
deal with them because my understanding
 
03:54:43.610 --> 03:54:43.620 align:start position:0%
is that they require different treatment
 
03:54:46.070 --> 03:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
than firefighters usually use for them
 
03:54:50.269 --> 03:54:50.279 align:start position:0%
yes so so I know that they um
 
03:54:52.969 --> 03:54:52.979 align:start position:0%
they have uh
 
03:54:55.490 --> 03:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
one gentleman one investigator from the
 
03:54:57.410 --> 03:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal's Office who has gone out
 
03:54:59.929 --> 03:54:59.939 align:start position:0%
and he has conducted some trainings he's
 
03:55:01.429 --> 03:55:01.439 align:start position:0%
also met with industry I know he
 
03:55:02.630 --> 03:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
presented a training to the New
 
03:55:05.269 --> 03:55:05.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire auto dealers so we have uh one
 
03:55:07.429 --> 03:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
member of the Fire Marshal's Office who
 
03:55:09.469 --> 03:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
understands how to addressify how to
 
03:55:11.689 --> 03:55:11.699 align:start position:0%
deal with it you know how hot it burns
 
03:55:14.090 --> 03:55:14.100 align:start position:0%
you know why this won't work that how to
 
03:55:16.189 --> 03:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
stay away from it so we do have a
 
03:55:18.349 --> 03:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
subject matter expert who if you know
 
03:55:20.809 --> 03:55:20.819 align:start position:0%
anyone who needs training let us know we
 
03:55:22.729 --> 03:55:22.739 align:start position:0%
can we can
 
03:55:24.769 --> 03:55:24.779 align:start position:0%
that's not me but we do have somebody at
 
03:55:29.269 --> 03:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:31.490 --> 03:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
um in addition to firefighter training
 
03:55:34.010 --> 03:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh this division is also responsible for
 
03:55:36.349 --> 03:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
oversight of EMS activities in the state
 
03:55:38.330 --> 03:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
and so the Bureau of Emergency Medical
 
03:55:40.670 --> 03:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
Services manages and regulates EMS
 
03:55:42.889 --> 03:55:42.899 align:start position:0%
education practical testing and then
 
03:55:44.870 --> 03:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
provides clinical oversight and protocol
 
03:55:46.429 --> 03:55:46.439 align:start position:0%
development so they're not actually
 
03:55:48.429 --> 03:55:48.439 align:start position:0%
doing the training in this case but
 
03:55:51.050 --> 03:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
overseeing the trainers and the programs
 
03:55:52.910 --> 03:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
themselves the curriculum
 
03:55:57.290 --> 03:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
they license sub 5 375 EMS providers and
 
03:56:01.309 --> 03:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
472 ambulances also responsible for data
 
03:56:02.809 --> 03:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
management collection and Analysis
 
03:56:04.729 --> 03:56:04.739 align:start position:0%

03:56:08.210 --> 03:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
in the Bureau of certification and
 
03:56:10.490 --> 03:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
support provides instructor Fire officer
 
03:56:12.530 --> 03:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
fire investigator and some command
 
03:56:14.269 --> 03:56:14.279 align:start position:0%
system certifications and other National
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
Fire Academy training programs
 
03:56:18.830 --> 03:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
they develop online educational content
 
03:56:21.050 --> 03:56:21.060 align:start position:0%
for all division programming and manage
 
03:56:22.670 --> 03:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
course registrations and Billings
 
03:56:25.370 --> 03:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
including certificate production as well
 
03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
as oversee the reception staff
 
03:56:29.630 --> 03:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
just just add to representative Heath
 
03:56:31.729 --> 03:56:31.739 align:start position:0%
real quick what I'll let you know is uh
 
03:56:34.550 --> 03:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
the team like the director of the fire
 
03:56:38.030 --> 03:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
academy the fire marshal Mark Doyle from
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 and Rob Buxton from Homeland
 
03:56:42.110 --> 03:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
Security we have gone out and done
 
03:56:44.750 --> 03:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
Outreach meetings by region with the
 
03:56:47.269 --> 03:56:47.279 align:start position:0%
fire service call full so we've been to
 
03:56:49.610 --> 03:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
monagnarok we've been to the North
 
03:56:52.130 --> 03:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
Country we were just at
 
03:56:54.050 --> 03:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
um where were we the other night we're
 
03:56:56.090 --> 03:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
in Lebanon so we're going out and we're
 
03:57:00.050 --> 03:57:00.060 align:start position:0%
bringing in 15 20 full call part-time
 
03:57:01.790 --> 03:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
here's what we deliver at the state
 
03:57:04.490 --> 03:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
level are you missing anything so we've
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
really done a lot of community outreach
 
03:57:07.969 --> 03:57:07.979 align:start position:0%
been there you know a couple hours long
 
03:57:10.250 --> 03:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
but we learn a lot but these directors
 
03:57:12.710 --> 03:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
have been really engaged to say what
 
03:57:15.170 --> 03:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
what services are we not delivering or
 
03:57:16.790 --> 03:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
what need to be online are the times
 
03:57:18.469 --> 03:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
working are they not and what we find
 
03:57:19.610 --> 03:57:19.620 align:start position:0%
when we go out there's a lot of
 
03:57:21.590 --> 03:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
volunteer and call that quite frankly
 
03:57:26.710 --> 03:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:29.809 --> 03:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
h32 shows the funding for fire standards
 
03:57:31.010 --> 03:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
and training and Emergency Medical
 
03:57:33.950 --> 03:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
Services they're predominantly funded by
 
03:57:38.030 --> 03:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
the fire fund the fire fund is supported
 
03:57:40.910 --> 03:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
by fees collected through the sale of
 
03:57:43.490 --> 03:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicle driving history records
 
03:57:46.309 --> 03:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
per predominantly to insurance companies
 
03:57:48.889 --> 03:57:48.899 align:start position:0%
but to others for authorized use and so
 
03:57:51.950 --> 03:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
those fees support the fire the go into
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
the fire fund and support this Division
 
03:57:55.969 --> 03:57:55.979 align:start position:0%
and also the division of fire safety
 
03:57:57.290 --> 03:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
which is the next division that we'll
 
03:57:58.389 --> 03:57:58.399 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
03:58:01.250 --> 03:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
the other funding section are instructor
 
03:58:04.189 --> 03:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
fees that are paid for paid directly for
 
03:58:06.229 --> 03:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
course participation that's where
 
03:58:08.689 --> 03:58:08.699 align:start position:0%
there's a subsidy that supports the
 
03:58:12.050 --> 03:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
locals locals are paying 135 dollars for
 
03:58:14.750 --> 03:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
each firefighter one course and 150 for
 
03:58:16.969 --> 03:58:16.979 align:start position:0%
each firefighter 2 course which is a
 
03:58:19.670 --> 03:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced rate if you're not
 
03:58:21.710 --> 03:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated Department you're paying
 
03:58:23.330 --> 03:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
four thousand dollars for firefighter
 
03:58:27.050 --> 03:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
one and 2190 for firefighter 2. so
 
03:58:29.570 --> 03:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
that's really a critical part of of
 
03:58:31.370 --> 03:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
um the support that the division
 
03:58:35.389 --> 03:58:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:37.130 --> 03:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
any questions on fire standards and
 
03:58:37.140 --> 03:58:38.929 align:start position:0%
any questions on fire standards and
training

03:58:38.929 --> 03:58:38.939 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:58:40.370 --> 03:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
what uh
 
03:58:42.530 --> 03:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
does this uh do they have to be
 
03:58:45.710 --> 03:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
certified a certain way uh and
 
03:58:47.510 --> 03:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
how often
 
03:58:50.090 --> 03:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
so to be a full-time firefighter in New
 
03:58:52.070 --> 03:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you need to have passed
 
03:58:54.050 --> 03:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
firefighter one
 
03:58:55.969 --> 03:58:55.979 align:start position:0%
um and firefighter two just firefighter
 
03:58:58.490 --> 03:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
just firefighter one and that allows you
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
to be a full-time uh firefighter the
 
03:59:00.720 --> 03:59:02.229 align:start position:0%
to be a full-time uh firefighter the
part-time

03:59:02.229 --> 03:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
03:59:04.550 --> 03:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
firefighter positions don't require any
 
03:59:07.070 --> 03:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
certification it's encouraged but it's
 
03:59:08.929 --> 03:59:08.939 align:start position:0%
not a requirement at that level and
 
03:59:10.370 --> 03:59:10.380 align:start position:0%
that's why we want to encourage and
 
03:59:12.530 --> 03:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
support because if the trainings matter
 
03:59:14.689 --> 03:59:14.699 align:start position:0%
what we don't want is someone to just
 
03:59:16.729 --> 03:59:16.739 align:start position:0%
sign up so we have to do everything we
 
03:59:19.010 --> 03:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
can to get the training to those and a
 
03:59:20.809 --> 03:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
lot of those are volunteers so they have
 
03:59:25.070 --> 03:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:27.050 --> 03:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
yeah first of all that's a really good
 
03:59:30.110 --> 03:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
field trip is to go to the fire that was
 
03:59:31.790 --> 03:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
a great field trip and I wanted to
 
03:59:33.889 --> 03:59:33.899 align:start position:0%
follow up about the volunteers how many
 
03:59:36.349 --> 03:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
communities still really rely on only
 
03:59:38.689 --> 03:59:38.699 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighters I mean Newcastle
 
03:59:40.729 --> 03:59:40.739 align:start position:0%
has only fairly recently hired I think
 
03:59:42.530 --> 03:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
we have two now I can get you that
 
03:59:44.150 --> 03:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
number but I'm reminded every time I go
 
03:59:45.710 --> 03:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
up north it's the majority you'd be
 
03:59:48.050 --> 03:59:48.060 align:start position:0%
surprised so you know when you look in
 
03:59:50.689 --> 03:59:50.699 align:start position:0%
you know when you look at Portsmouth you
 
03:59:52.189 --> 03:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
know the services can be delivered in
 
03:59:54.769 --> 03:59:54.779 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and then you go to Lebanon
 
03:59:57.110 --> 03:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
but then next to Lebanon is the Piermont
 
03:59:59.389 --> 03:59:59.399 align:start position:0%
or the line Chief and you look at
 
04:00:01.490 --> 04:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
Hanover I mean it's different and but
 
04:00:04.309 --> 04:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
they're all good people they just need a
 
04:00:07.849 --> 04:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
different type of support and um
 
04:00:11.210 --> 04:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
right uh thank you uh
 
04:00:12.650 --> 04:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
uh High School
 
04:00:14.689 --> 04:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
a lot of high school kids want to get
 
04:00:16.910 --> 04:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
involved in firefighting as a even even
 
04:00:20.450 --> 04:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
as a volunteer status uh do you interact
 
04:00:22.790 --> 04:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
with the high schools you know certified
 
04:00:25.429 --> 04:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
I know I know I think Dover has a
 
04:00:28.429 --> 04:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
program through their CTE and and this
 
04:00:30.650 --> 04:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
would be valuable even if we continued
 
04:00:32.929 --> 04:00:32.939 align:start position:0%
on to a community college system so I
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
will tell you this based on director
 
04:00:37.670 --> 04:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
cutting Justin cutting who started his
 
04:00:39.410 --> 04:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
career in Enfield
 
04:00:42.110 --> 04:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
went to Hampton finished a full-time
 
04:00:44.750 --> 04:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
career in a large department and now
 
04:00:47.269 --> 04:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
he's the director of the fire academy he
 
04:00:49.849 --> 04:00:49.859 align:start position:0%
worked with Senate Apprentice in a team
 
04:00:51.950 --> 04:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
to have a retreat Recruitment and
 
04:00:55.010 --> 04:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
Retention committee there was 12 or so
 
04:00:57.229 --> 04:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
that came in multi-disciplinary all
 
04:00:59.510 --> 04:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
walks of life what can we do to enhance
 
04:01:03.110 --> 04:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
not only recruiting retaining in an
 
04:01:04.729 --> 04:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
increasing diversity in the fire service
 
04:01:06.590 --> 04:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
so they looked at it they came out with
 
04:01:09.590 --> 04:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
a a recommendation but what Justin did
 
04:01:11.689 --> 04:01:11.699 align:start position:0%
director cutting he secured funding to
 
04:01:13.550 --> 04:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
have a full-time Recruitment and
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
Retention specialist that works in there
 
04:01:18.410 --> 04:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
that's studying this and dealing with
 
04:01:20.689 --> 04:01:20.699 align:start position:0%
all the communities and engaging them to
 
04:01:23.689 --> 04:01:23.699 align:start position:0%
help support So to to how do we you know
 
04:01:26.030 --> 04:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
how do we meet the needs of this city as
 
04:01:27.410 --> 04:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
opposed to this town so we have a
 
04:01:30.050 --> 04:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
full-time woman who's working at the
 
04:01:32.330 --> 04:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
fire academy focused on Statewide
 
04:01:32.340 --> 04:01:34.429 align:start position:0%
fire academy focused on Statewide
recruitment

04:01:34.429 --> 04:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
recruitment
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair just a quick
 
04:01:38.990 --> 04:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up question right
 
04:01:41.330 --> 04:01:41.340 align:start position:0%
what are the qualifications one needs to
 
04:01:43.010 --> 04:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
you know how does one enter the
 
04:01:44.990 --> 04:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
firefighter You Know Field assuming they
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
are looking at a full-time position I'm
 
04:01:49.070 --> 04:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
from Windham obviously you know we don't
 
04:01:50.870 --> 04:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
really have uh you know volunteer
 
04:01:54.410 --> 04:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
firefighters so what are you know how do
 
04:01:56.689 --> 04:01:56.699 align:start position:0%
you go about after graduating high
 
04:01:58.790 --> 04:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
school to pursue a career in that field
 
04:02:00.469 --> 04:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
because I'm pretty sure some of our kids
 
04:02:02.570 --> 04:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
may be interested but I was never able
 
04:02:04.670 --> 04:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
to you know figure out exactly what the
 
04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
right path is sure well it differs but I
 
04:02:08.570 --> 04:02:08.580 align:start position:0%
think they you know first though they
 
04:02:09.950 --> 04:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
have to pass a test there's a national
 
04:02:11.870 --> 04:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
test it has to be you know and that's
 
04:02:13.969 --> 04:02:13.979 align:start position:0%
done at the at the fire academy and then
 
04:02:15.110 --> 04:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
they have to
 
04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
um they have to take the course the the
 
04:02:19.550 --> 04:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
fire course some departments require you
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
to be maybe an EMT some require you to
 
04:02:25.610 --> 04:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
be uh an advanced EMT or a paramedic so
 
04:02:27.349 --> 04:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
everything's different but I guess the
 
04:02:29.630 --> 04:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
point is that what we're trying to do is
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
where it is different and you in some
 
04:02:33.410 --> 04:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
folks and even director cuttings looking
 
04:02:35.689 --> 04:02:35.699 align:start position:0%
at Bridge programs how do you get from
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
paramedic to being a nurse you know it's
 
04:02:40.969 --> 04:02:40.979 align:start position:0%
easy to go to go from the medical side
 
04:02:43.370 --> 04:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the emergency management
 
04:02:45.590 --> 04:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
but it's not as easy to to matriculate
 
04:02:47.990 --> 04:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
from from our side to this so when I
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
tell you I don't have all the answers
 
04:02:51.950 --> 04:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
but they they are focused on this they
 
04:02:53.570 --> 04:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
are laser focused and they hired
 
04:02:56.809 --> 04:02:56.819 align:start position:0%
somebody to to look at that so thank you
 
04:02:58.670 --> 04:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
so I would encourage anybody that wants
 
04:02:59.929 --> 04:02:59.939 align:start position:0%
to do it we you know we have someone
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:04.610 --> 04:03:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you we have
 
04:03:06.710 --> 04:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
we had pushback when we're transitioning
 
04:03:09.349 --> 04:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
from a volunteer to paid staff for the
 
04:03:11.450 --> 04:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
fire department is that typical do you
 
04:03:13.550 --> 04:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
see that in other places
 
04:03:15.469 --> 04:03:15.479 align:start position:0%
we wanted to keep the volunteers it was
 
04:03:17.870 --> 04:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
unbelievable I I you know what that has
 
04:03:19.910 --> 04:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
come up at our meetings and I know that
 
04:03:21.889 --> 04:03:21.899 align:start position:0%
some Chiefs and I believe it's when I
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
went to the Monadnock region said you
 
04:03:26.090 --> 04:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
know we I manage that I have full-time I
 
04:03:28.670 --> 04:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
have call I have this so so these and
 
04:03:30.650 --> 04:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
again I was never uh I didn't come from
 
04:03:32.090 --> 04:03:32.100 align:start position:0%
the fire service but I think in some
 
04:03:33.889 --> 04:03:33.899 align:start position:0%
areas they have to you work with
 
04:03:36.050 --> 04:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
whatever you whatever you can you know
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
one thing I I will share is that I was I
 
04:03:40.790 --> 04:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
was really surprised to see how many
 
04:03:42.710 --> 04:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
volunteers there were you know and I met
 
04:03:44.269 --> 04:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
one gentleman who had been doing it for
 
04:03:47.510 --> 04:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
50 years so there's a lot of there's a
 
04:03:49.070 --> 04:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
lot of call and volunteer departments
 
04:03:54.189 --> 04:03:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:57.769 --> 04:03:57.779 align:start position:0%
all right page 33 uh is the division of
 
04:03:59.870 --> 04:03:59.880 align:start position:0%
fire safety whose mission is saving
 
04:04:01.490 --> 04:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
lives and property through education
 
04:04:03.889 --> 04:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
engineering and enforcement and this
 
04:04:05.510 --> 04:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
Photograph here is actually a trailer
 
04:04:07.610 --> 04:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
that the division operates that shows
 
04:04:09.650 --> 04:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
the impacts of a room with a sprinkler
 
04:04:11.570 --> 04:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
and without a sprinkler and so behind
 
04:04:12.830 --> 04:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
you can see that's the without a
 
04:04:17.210 --> 04:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:20.150 --> 04:04:20.160 align:start position:0%

page 36 shows funding for the division
 
04:06:13.729 --> 04:06:13.739 align:start position:0%
of fire safety just like fire standards
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
and training they're funded
 
04:06:17.510 --> 04:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
predominantly with fire funds and a
 
04:06:19.010 --> 04:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
small portion of General funds for the
 
04:06:21.469 --> 04:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
modular building program
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
um the the I'll take a moment to stop
 
04:06:26.269 --> 04:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
here and just talk briefly about the
 
04:06:27.650 --> 04:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
fire fund
 
04:06:29.809 --> 04:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
um for those of you who are returning
 
04:06:31.490 --> 04:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
members you know that the fire fund has
 
04:06:33.229 --> 04:06:33.239 align:start position:0%
been we've had some challenges with
 
04:06:34.969 --> 04:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
funding the fire fund over the past
 
04:06:36.650 --> 04:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
several years
 
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
um as we expected uh the end of FY 23
 
04:06:42.950 --> 04:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
we're projecting the fire fund
 
04:06:46.130 --> 04:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
um fund balance to be close to zero
 
04:06:49.250 --> 04:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
um essentially essentially zero and so
 
04:06:51.349 --> 04:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
in order to fund the division of fire
 
04:06:52.849 --> 04:06:52.859 align:start position:0%
safety and the division of fire
 
04:06:55.130 --> 04:06:55.140 align:start position:0%
standards and training using fire fund
 
04:06:58.550 --> 04:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
revenues we will need to increase the
 
04:07:01.070 --> 04:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
fees associated with the data
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
um that that's currently being utilized
 
04:07:05.090 --> 04:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
and so we have a request to do so
 
04:07:07.790 --> 04:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
through our agency phase and we'll have
 
04:07:09.530 --> 04:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
more discussions about that when the
 
04:07:13.130 --> 04:07:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:13.140 --> 04:07:17.830 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:07:17.830 --> 04:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:20.150 --> 04:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
legislation on it or
 
04:07:23.990 --> 04:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
is it okay so this would be through um
 
04:07:26.269 --> 04:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
the fee structure for these are it's
 
04:07:28.910 --> 04:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
it's a combination of some um some are
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
in statute summer administrative rule
 
04:07:31.680 --> 04:07:32.510 align:start position:0%
in statute summer administrative rule
um summer

04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
um summer
 
04:07:34.070 --> 04:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner has the authority to
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
make those adjustments and so as part of
 
04:07:38.030 --> 04:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
the budget process we would be
 
04:07:39.410 --> 04:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
discussing some adjustments through
 
04:07:41.210 --> 04:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
house bill 2.
 
04:07:43.790 --> 04:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
yeah if if there's not a bill over in
 
04:07:45.290 --> 04:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
ways and means and we'd have to do it in
 
04:07:48.290 --> 04:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
hp2 but we'd also coordinate with ways
 
04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
um so in summary
 
04:07:57.290 --> 04:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
um we've got seven divisions in team
 
04:07:57.300 --> 04:07:58.610 align:start position:0%
um we've got seven divisions in team
safety

04:07:58.610 --> 04:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
safety
 
04:08:01.490 --> 04:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
um our full-time positions and our part
 
04:08:04.250 --> 04:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
times are all dedicated to Public Safety
 
04:08:04.260 --> 04:08:05.030 align:start position:0%
times are all dedicated to Public Safety
um

04:08:05.030 --> 04:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:07.309 --> 04:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
Public Safety truly is customer service
 
04:08:09.469 --> 04:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
all of these divisions as you've seen
 
04:08:12.050 --> 04:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
are delivering Public Safety Services to
 
04:08:13.729 --> 04:08:13.739 align:start position:0%
the customer that's the residents of New
 
04:08:15.290 --> 04:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's also visitors to New
 
04:08:15.300 --> 04:08:16.550 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's also visitors to New
Hampshire

04:08:16.550 --> 04:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
um who who we are responsible for
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
responding to like hikers in those
 
04:08:22.670 --> 04:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
situations that you mentioned
 
04:08:24.830 --> 04:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
um we're constantly looking at process
 
04:08:25.969 --> 04:08:25.979 align:start position:0%
Improvement we're looking at
 
04:08:27.950 --> 04:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities to utilize technology to
 
04:08:30.469 --> 04:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
deliver more efficient services to
 
04:08:33.050 --> 04:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
improve the services that we do deliver
 
04:08:35.090 --> 04:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
um and and we're leaders in the industry
 
04:08:37.550 --> 04:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
the 911 system in the state of New
 
04:08:39.349 --> 04:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's a Statewide 911 system
 
04:08:42.050 --> 04:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
which is unique there aren't many like
 
04:08:45.170 --> 04:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
this in in the country we've got Cutting
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
Edge forensic laboratory analysis that's
 
04:08:49.389 --> 04:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
being put into place to address
 
04:08:51.070 --> 04:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
to address
 
04:08:54.590 --> 04:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
efficiency issues that we have highly
 
04:08:56.269 --> 04:08:56.279 align:start position:0%

community-based emergency preparedness
 
04:09:06.229 --> 04:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
and planning automated fuel tax
 
04:09:09.530 --> 04:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
Collections and DMV operations focused
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
on on customer service while also
 
04:09:13.849 --> 04:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
ensuring compliance with with federal
 
04:09:16.969 --> 04:09:16.979 align:start position:0%
and state law so that that concludes our
 
04:09:19.070 --> 04:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
presentation and if anyone has any
 
04:09:20.570 --> 04:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
additional questions we'd be happy to
 
04:09:22.550 --> 04:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
address them I would just say one
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
comment it's working
 
04:09:26.750 --> 04:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
because I read recently they were the
 
04:09:29.030 --> 04:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
safest state in the nation
 
04:09:32.929 --> 04:09:32.939 align:start position:0%
so yes absolutely thank you Steve
 
04:09:36.349 --> 04:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
so so yeah thank you you know the the
 
04:09:38.510 --> 04:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
only thing I'll add to it that isn't
 
04:09:39.950 --> 04:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
here is and I think we touched in a
 
04:09:42.950 --> 04:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
little is even even to keep to respond
 
04:09:44.450 --> 04:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
to everything that happens that you
 
04:09:46.130 --> 04:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
can't prepare for the unknown so every
 
04:09:47.450 --> 04:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
day you know you can think of a
 
04:09:49.070 --> 04:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
strategic plan but every day it could be
 
04:09:50.510 --> 04:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
you know we don't know what's going to
 
04:09:53.330 --> 04:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
happen right but we have we have some
 
04:09:55.969 --> 04:09:55.979 align:start position:0%
major projects in the upcoming biennium
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
that Steve's got to manage buildings
 
04:10:01.189 --> 04:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
facilities testing programs so we've got
 
04:10:04.370 --> 04:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
a lot I'm also assigned 30 boards and
 
04:10:06.050 --> 04:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
commissions that either myself or
 
04:10:09.229 --> 04:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
someone from the agency sits on so above
 
04:10:11.870 --> 04:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
and beyond the day to day whether you're
 
04:10:13.910 --> 04:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
the division of State Police or or the
 
04:10:16.189 --> 04:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
director of Motor Vehicles we've it's
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
good we've been forward-leaning to to
 
04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
secure grant funding and to to advance
 
04:10:24.290 --> 04:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
our you know our customer service but
 
04:10:27.170 --> 04:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
but you know it's it it's a lot of work
 
04:10:29.630 --> 04:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
and and I'll end with the people that we
 
04:10:31.910 --> 04:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
have there are truly really dedicated
 
04:10:34.910 --> 04:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
they are getting it done and and I
 
04:10:37.189 --> 04:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate your uh your support and
 
04:10:40.550 --> 04:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman commissioner we
 
04:10:45.650 --> 04:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
had some pretty good uh Federal fund
 
04:10:48.530 --> 04:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
increases because of covid and so on can
 
04:10:50.929 --> 04:10:50.939 align:start position:0%
you anticipate whether these will last
 
04:10:52.490 --> 04:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
through this two years of this next
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
budget or if you give it they grants
 
04:10:57.530 --> 04:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
that have lasted a while or so do we
 
04:10:59.689 --> 04:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
know yeah I'll let Steve but we we were
 
04:11:01.070 --> 04:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
really like anytime There's an
 
04:11:04.010 --> 04:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity Steve put pen to paper where
 
04:11:05.809 --> 04:11:05.819 align:start position:0%
are our gaps where can we Bridge a gap
 
04:11:08.150 --> 04:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
where we might have a lack of employees
 
04:11:11.330 --> 04:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
but technology will bridge that bill so
 
04:11:14.090 --> 04:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
so yes we did really well so I think
 
04:11:15.410 --> 04:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
you're going to start seeing the federal
 
04:11:18.769 --> 04:11:18.779 align:start position:0%
opportunities decline now
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
um we were very strategic in ensuring
 
04:11:21.840 --> 04:11:23.389 align:start position:0%
um we were very strategic in ensuring
that

04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:26.269 --> 04:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
we applied for things that would be as
 
04:11:28.670 --> 04:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
close to a one-time cost as possible and
 
04:11:30.590 --> 04:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
I say as close to because whenever you
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
move something
 
04:11:33.410 --> 04:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
um to you know an online or an
 
04:11:34.670 --> 04:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
electronic function there's going to be
 
04:11:37.250 --> 04:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
maintenance costs there's a tail to that
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
um but we're we're cognizant of that and
 
04:11:41.450 --> 04:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable that we could absorb
 
04:11:43.309 --> 04:11:43.319 align:start position:0%
that tail with operating funds and that
 
04:11:46.250 --> 04:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
it was worth it and so um so technology
 
04:11:48.170 --> 04:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
improvements process improvements that's
 
04:11:50.030 --> 04:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
where we tried to focus
 
04:11:52.910 --> 04:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
um and then the the only variance there
 
04:11:54.830 --> 04:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
is going to be your your pass-through
 
04:11:56.450 --> 04:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
funds to locals and so that's what I
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
think you're going to see carry forward
 
04:11:59.389 --> 04:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
through this biennium and then
 
04:12:02.150 --> 04:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
potentially drop off in the next you
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
know I'll speak to it to compliment
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
Steve and it's in his his assistant Miss
 
04:12:08.330 --> 04:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
domian who's out back the the it's easy
 
04:12:10.849 --> 04:12:10.859 align:start position:0%
to see a problem but they quickly looked
 
04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
at the plate room and ordering plates
 
04:12:15.290 --> 04:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
and stickers and decals and it was paper
 
04:12:18.590 --> 04:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
and they worked many nights carrying
 
04:12:20.570 --> 04:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
license plates back and forth doing
 
04:12:23.870 --> 04:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
deliveries in in both Steve and 80 said
 
04:12:26.570 --> 04:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
you know we need to integrate this with
 
04:12:30.290 --> 04:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
with our vision we need to automate we
 
04:12:31.849 --> 04:12:31.859 align:start position:0%
need to be able to strategically
 
04:12:34.010 --> 04:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
understand when folks are going to need
 
04:12:35.450 --> 04:12:35.460 align:start position:0%
more license plates what are the
 
04:12:37.250 --> 04:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
sequence what are the decals we need to
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
automate that but very quickly they put
 
04:12:41.210 --> 04:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
a grant together secured the funds and
 
04:12:43.550 --> 04:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
but again it's not done yet now now the
 
04:12:46.670 --> 04:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
work is really starting but but you know
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
we have we haven't been able to fix
 
04:12:50.269 --> 04:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
everything but the things that I think
 
04:12:52.130 --> 04:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
are the most important we've got some
 
04:12:54.410 --> 04:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
federal dollars and we've had support
 
04:12:57.469 --> 04:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
and and we've got the folks that can get
 
04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
the projects completed
 
04:13:02.330 --> 04:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
I was impressed with the way you handled
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
this flood of of special license plates
 
04:13:06.410 --> 04:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
requests that
 
04:13:08.929 --> 04:13:08.939 align:start position:0%
commissioner Flynn just said no no no
 
04:13:10.969 --> 04:13:10.979 align:start position:0%
for years and years and we had all these
 
04:13:13.010 --> 04:13:13.020 align:start position:0%
people I want one for the military I
 
04:13:14.750 --> 04:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
want one for this group I want one for
 
04:13:16.969 --> 04:13:16.979 align:start position:0%
the and and that coming out with that
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
plate with me your organization you sell
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
the sticker leave me alone well that was
 
04:13:23.990 --> 04:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
very successful that was very clever
 
04:13:25.610 --> 04:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
because everybody wanted their own plate
 
04:13:27.769 --> 04:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
yeah and you see States like Florida I
 
04:13:29.929 --> 04:13:29.939 align:start position:0%
bet they have 15 16 different license
 
04:13:32.150 --> 04:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
plates I mean that gets pretty
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
complicated it's bad enough all the ones
 
04:13:35.689 --> 04:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
you have to do for the legislature right
 
04:13:37.849 --> 04:13:37.859 align:start position:0%
I remember somebody when they were
 
04:13:40.610 --> 04:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
having that came in with a big case of
 
04:13:42.170 --> 04:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
special license plates that everybody
 
04:13:45.050 --> 04:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
had to have well thank you I appreciate
 
04:13:47.030 --> 04:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
it was a challenge but you dealt with it
 
04:13:48.590 --> 04:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
very well thank you
 
04:13:51.110 --> 04:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um I had a question this
 
04:13:52.550 --> 04:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
morning of Department of Transportation
 
04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
and they said oh no that's safety yeah
 
04:13:57.889 --> 04:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
so now that you're here so no so I will
 
04:13:59.330 --> 04:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
tell you and it's important for you to
 
04:14:02.090 --> 04:14:02.100 align:start position:0%
know that what we're doing here it
 
04:14:03.530 --> 04:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't work if we don't support the
 
04:14:05.570 --> 04:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
other state agencies right so we have a
 
04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
very good relationship with um build
 
04:14:09.650 --> 04:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
Cass fish and game
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
um all of them HHS I work very closely
 
04:14:14.809 --> 04:14:14.819 align:start position:0%
with with Lori Weaver you know we have
 
04:14:16.070 --> 04:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
this thing called the state hospital
 
04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
that we shared together that we have a
 
04:14:20.929 --> 04:14:20.939 align:start position:0%
lot going on and um you know when you
 
04:14:22.670 --> 04:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
say it's one team our team but it but it
 
04:14:24.950 --> 04:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
really is it's a big team yeah that this
 
04:14:25.849 --> 04:14:25.859 align:start position:0%
was around
 
04:14:28.070 --> 04:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
um enforcement of weight limits for
 
04:14:28.080 --> 04:14:29.090 align:start position:0%
um enforcement of weight limits for
Bridges

04:14:29.090 --> 04:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
Bridges
 
04:14:30.650 --> 04:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
um just in particular I had constituents
 
04:14:32.210 --> 04:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
come to me to say that they know that
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
there are uh trucks going over the
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
little Newcastle Bridge there's a big
 
04:14:38.929 --> 04:14:38.939 align:start position:0%
residential construction site off Wild
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
Rose Lane and
 
04:14:42.590 --> 04:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
um these people are involved in
 
04:14:43.969 --> 04:14:43.979 align:start position:0%
construction and they're pretty sure
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
that those trucks are way over the limit
 
04:14:48.349 --> 04:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
and so they're asking me about it and so
 
04:14:50.210 --> 04:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
just you know in a general sense how do
 
04:14:52.370 --> 04:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
you deal with the weight enforcement I
 
04:14:53.689 --> 04:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
joke about it when people ask me about
 
04:14:55.130 --> 04:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
going over the bridge I say just roll
 
04:14:58.370 --> 04:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
down your window you know so no so so
 
04:15:01.370 --> 04:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
again I I mean I that's that's we we
 
04:15:03.170 --> 04:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
several years ago we worked in this
 
04:15:05.450 --> 04:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
bridge weight formula and there is there
 
04:15:07.010 --> 04:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
are federal requirements but our troop
 
04:15:08.929 --> 04:15:08.939 align:start position:0%
to you guys we've worked with we worked
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
with the industry we looked at it so
 
04:15:12.530 --> 04:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
there's a couple things there's the
 
04:15:15.170 --> 04:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
there's the overall weight then it's how
 
04:15:17.750 --> 04:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
the load is signed it could be you know
 
04:15:20.030 --> 04:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
an axle overweight but
 
04:15:21.710 --> 04:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
um but many of those
 
04:15:24.650 --> 04:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
um many of those are are okay what I
 
04:15:26.510 --> 04:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
would do is if there if anyone has a
 
04:15:27.950 --> 04:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
question I would Point them to Troop G
 
04:15:29.590 --> 04:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
if they think somebody
 
04:15:32.030 --> 04:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they're not
 
04:15:33.889 --> 04:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
um and uh but again we worked through
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we worked we sat with D.O.T we sat
 
04:15:38.809 --> 04:15:38.819 align:start position:0%
with FM CSA Federal Motor Carrier and we
 
04:15:40.250 --> 04:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
dealt with the industry
 
04:15:42.610 --> 04:15:42.620 align:start position:0%
you know we've dealt with uh the Timber
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
on it you know we've you know so we
 
04:15:47.689 --> 04:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
listened to them and I look at the the
 
04:15:50.090 --> 04:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
folks and say is this is this unsafe and
 
04:15:52.610 --> 04:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
if it's not then we have to look at you
 
04:15:55.189 --> 04:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
know balancing you know folks are trying
 
04:15:57.110 --> 04:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
to you know transfer comments the other
 
04:15:59.090 --> 04:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
thing is if you look at the States you
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
would think they are all like they would
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
be standardized but there are different
 
04:16:04.849 --> 04:16:04.859 align:start position:0%
requirements Maine was different than
 
04:16:07.429 --> 04:16:07.439 align:start position:0%
Vermont and New Hampshire so it's a lot
 
04:16:09.110 --> 04:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
to learn you know but thankfully we have
 
04:16:13.370 --> 04:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:16.250 --> 04:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
I have a final question kind of a nosy
 
04:16:16.260 --> 04:16:17.030 align:start position:0%
I have a final question kind of a nosy
question

04:16:17.030 --> 04:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:16:18.830 --> 04:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
I was talking to our town man I'm from
 
04:16:18.840 --> 04:16:19.610 align:start position:0%
I was talking to our town man I'm from
Hampton

04:16:19.610 --> 04:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
Hampton
 
04:16:21.469 --> 04:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
and I was talking about town manager
 
04:16:24.590 --> 04:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
recently about Staffing and vacancies
 
04:16:28.130 --> 04:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
and he did we started discussing he has
 
04:16:29.990 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
an ability to call somewhere I don't
 
04:16:32.090 --> 04:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
know who he calls I I'm asking if it's
 
04:16:33.530 --> 04:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
you once you understand what I'm going
 
04:16:35.090 --> 04:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
to ask you
 
04:16:37.630 --> 04:16:37.640 align:start position:0%
on certain nights during the summer
 
04:16:40.610 --> 04:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach is very close to exploding
 
04:16:40.620 --> 04:16:41.630 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach is very close to exploding
right

04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:16:44.750 --> 04:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
and he has the ability and has exercised
 
04:16:48.110 --> 04:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
two or three times per per summer and
 
04:16:49.130 --> 04:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
I'll call
 
04:16:51.790 --> 04:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
that he calls and and
 
04:16:53.870 --> 04:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
reinforcements show up I mean he has to
 
04:16:55.309 --> 04:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
pay for him pay their mileage and all
 
04:16:57.530 --> 04:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
that is that through you yeah well
 
04:16:59.450 --> 04:16:59.460 align:start position:0%
actually it's it's through it's actually
 
04:17:02.450 --> 04:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
lower than than me so so you've got the
 
04:17:04.490 --> 04:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
colonel of the State Police we have
 
04:17:06.889 --> 04:17:06.899 align:start position:0%
field captains then troop a which
 
04:17:08.689 --> 04:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
Hampton Falls under would have a troop
 
04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
Commander or a lieutenant and and every
 
04:17:12.530 --> 04:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
year they have an excellent relationship
 
04:17:15.229 --> 04:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
you know uh uh Jamie Sullivan who was
 
04:17:16.610 --> 04:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
the police chief
 
04:17:18.050 --> 04:17:18.060 align:start position:0%
um you know he's dealt with this for
 
04:17:20.450 --> 04:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
years but it's actually very very simple
 
04:17:22.729 --> 04:17:22.739 align:start position:0%
you know if they think they need more we
 
04:17:25.070 --> 04:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
have a contingency plan they call and we
 
04:17:26.689 --> 04:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
respond some folks to help them but we
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous relationship with with
 
04:17:31.490 --> 04:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
Hampton and we generally know it's that
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
preseason you know May and June when
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
kids are skipping school but then once
 
04:17:38.330 --> 04:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
and you get a hot you get a hot day and
 
04:17:40.490 --> 04:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
but but we prepare for that now but yeah
 
04:17:42.889 --> 04:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
he works he works with uh with this with
 
04:17:45.469 --> 04:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
the state police okay just nosy thing
 
04:17:49.250 --> 04:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
