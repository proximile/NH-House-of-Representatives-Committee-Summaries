00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
good to see the judicial Council here
 
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
you're welcome to come forward I know we
 
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
had some questions and we hadn't quite
 
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
finished with your presentation so we
 
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
thought giving you a little extra time
 
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 align:start position:0%
today would be beneficial to all of us
 
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
anyone following this is on page 537 I
 
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
believe in the budget
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
so it's all yours and I apologize that
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
we're don't have many members here today
 
00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
but for one reason or another the
 
00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
lights up
 
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
there you go thank you
 
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Richard
 
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
samparrell I'm the acting executive
 
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire judicial
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
Council and uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee for the
 
00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come back today and uh
 
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
further uh explain to you our budget
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
request and to answer any questions you
 
00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.170 align:start position:0%
request and to answer any questions you
had

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
when we left off last week we were
 
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.650 align:start position:0%
when we left off last week we were
um

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
talking about different account lines
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
that are covered under what I would put
 
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
a general heading of child protection
 
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
and I think just to maybe get us
 
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
oriented this morning I would start by
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
explaining to the committee that there
 
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
are really three different account lines
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
that are covered by this one is
 
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
um the casa line and I spoke to you a
 
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
bit about that last week
 
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
the next is
 
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
non-casa Guardian Ad Litem services
 
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
and then the third category is uh what
 
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
is also called a guardian ad litem
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
services but that's a little misleading
 
00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
because it covers a variety of different
 
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
services and expenses that aren't
 
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
covered in the other two categories
 
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
um I can if you'd like review with you
 
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
um the request for funding for Casa I
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
went through that with you uh last week
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
but uh as I explained then and I think
 
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
you have some additional materials that
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
were provided this morning uh from Casa
 
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
Casa is the preferred provider of
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem services in the state
 
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
and they're volunteer Advocates receive
 
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
uh extensive training extensive
 
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.710 align:start position:0%
uh extensive training extensive
supervision

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
supervision
 
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
our relationship with them is as a
 
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
result of a private public partnership
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
and the funding that they received in
 
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
this relationship provides children with
 
00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:49.979 align:start position:0%
uh Guardian advocacy and under this sort
 
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
of unique representation and
 
00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
reimbursement model
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
um at this point in time uh Casa is
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
looks like taking about 92 percent of
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
the new cases that are being opened in
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
general they've handled about three
 
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
quarters 75 percent of the cases
 
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:13.860 align:start position:0%
and the other cases that Casa does not
 
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
handle are that other line that you see
 
00:08:19.129 --> 00:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
of non-casa guardian and light of
 
00:08:21.409 --> 00:08:21.419 align:start position:0%
Services representative McGuire I think
 
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
last week you asked me how many uh
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
individuals are
 
00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
providing services that are not
 
00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
associated with Casa so in reviewing
 
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
some of our payments for the last three
 
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:37.700 align:start position:0%
years since 2021
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
we have paid a total of 35 different
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
non-casa gals eight of those are people
 
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
that have not worked on more than four
 
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
cases so it really is a pool of about
 
00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:56.420 align:start position:0%
27 28 Guardians
 
00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
the guardian ad litem
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
certification board
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
has a lot more Guardians available but I
 
00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:06.740 align:start position:0%
think it's important to distinguish
 
00:09:09.769 --> 00:09:09.779 align:start position:0%
these types of cases child
 
00:09:12.889 --> 00:09:12.899 align:start position:0%
protection cases from other situations
 
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
where there might be Guardians so for
 
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
example you might have Guardians in in
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
divorce cases that are appointed by the
 
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
court you might have Guardians in uh
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
what are called Chin's cases children in
 
00:09:29.329 --> 00:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
need of services those Guardians are
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
paid through dcyf
 
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
um you might have Guardians and adoption
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
cases those Guardians are paid through
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
the administrative office of the court
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
so when we use this sort of Guardian
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
heading it covers a lot of different
 
00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:44.459 align:start position:0%
things but here in these first two
 
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
account lines we're talking about
 
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:50.820 align:start position:0%
children who are in uh abuse and neglect
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
cases and then also termination of
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
parental rights cases which are commonly
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
called tpr cases and that often is an
 
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
extension of those abusive neglect
 
00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:02.329 align:start position:0%
extension of those abusive neglect
proceedings

00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:02.339 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
so getting back to the request for Casa
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
our request here is for additional
 
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
funding of two hundred thousand dollars
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
for each of the two years of the
 
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
biennium it's as I said last week
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to put a value on the
 
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
volunteers but if we were compensating
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
them for all of the hours and time that
 
00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:24.899 align:start position:0%
they put into cases
 
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
um I think we could
 
00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:29.339 align:start position:0%
put a cost figure on about eight million
 
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:31.220 align:start position:0%
dollars I think in part that's because
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
Casa volunteers generally spend a lot of
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
time with their the children that
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
they're working with they I don't have
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
statistical information for this but I
 
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
think it's fair to say they spend more
 
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
time than the court appointed Guardians
 
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
had light them they're involved for a
 
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
longer period of time and Casa is active
 
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
in recruiting and retaining those
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
volunteers so that they can handle more
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
of those cases
 
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.370 align:start position:0%
of those cases
it's

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:10:59.810 --> 00:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
um can we connect this to a page or line
 
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
in the budget I'm sorry I should have
 
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
started that way so the
 
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
uh line for uh Casa funding is at the
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
governor's budget at page 542.
 
00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:19.019 align:start position:0%
uh and this is
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
the non-casa gals that's also on 542 and
 
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
that line is uh 1101.
 
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
and then this I don't want to confuse
 
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:37.740 align:start position:0%
things or get ahead of myself or get
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
ahead of you but uh the third category
 
00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
of guarding it at Litem funding is 1092
 
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:44.700 align:start position:0%
and that's on a different page that's on
 
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
okay so now I see it so
 
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:51.650 align:start position:0%
okay so now I see it so
um

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
so we're providing costs of roughly last
 
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
time was a little under a million right
 
00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.610 align:start position:0%
time was a little under a million right
926

00:11:58.610 --> 00:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
926
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
000 and you're asking for 200 000 more
 
00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:05.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
um does that work is that right yeah I
 
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
think that's correct you're talking
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
about the so the actual expenditures in
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2021 for Casa was
 
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.009 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2021 for Casa was
um

00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:18.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
926 550 is that what you're looking at
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
yes and same as for some reason adjusted
 
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
authorized for 2023 is the same
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
right correct yeah so you know part of
 
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
that is going to correspond to well what
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
was a dip in cases during the pandemic I
 
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:39.380 align:start position:0%
think there was a lot of
 
00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:44.339 align:start position:0%
non-reporting or non uh exposure of of
 
00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
children to the normal people who would
 
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
be reporting and we're seeing a return
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
there to uh reporting rates or case
 
00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
filings that predated the pandemic so
 
00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
um there was a period of time where
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
there was sort of a lull in these child
 
00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:05.459 align:start position:0%
uh protection cases but that time is
 
00:13:05.459 --> 00:13:06.889 align:start position:0%
uh protection cases but that time is
over

00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay and so
 
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
the you're now saying that the Casas are
 
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
92 percent of the cases and these and
 
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
the non-casas are eight percent of the
 
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
cases no so in terms of recent cases
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
the order of proceeding is that Casa
 
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
because they're the preferred provider
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
they are appointed first if they can't
 
00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:37.019 align:start position:0%
take the case then it goes to a non-cosa
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem right now or recently
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
they have been able to accept 92 percent
 
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
of the cases that's not to say that they
 
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:50.220 align:start position:0%
currently uh represent 92 percent of the
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
of the children that are involved
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
um but you know it's a very good
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
indicator in the sense that they have
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
been training more volunteers they have
 
00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:01.139 align:start position:0%
more volunteers to work with and they're
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
able to take more cases whether that
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
Trend continues or not I can't predict
 
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
for you but I think it's it is safe for
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
us to assume that they'll continue to
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
handle at least 75 percent of the cases
 
00:14:16.139 --> 00:14:18.170 align:start position:0%
handle at least 75 percent of the cases
yeah

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:21.720 align:start position:0%
sure so where we where we had a problem
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
last time was when I looked at
 
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.110 align:start position:0%
last time was when I looked at
um

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
the ratios so look at 2024 for example
 
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
um for the Casas and 400 000 for the
 
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.110 align:start position:0%
um for the Casas and 400 000 for the
non-costas

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
non-costas
 
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
right correct and we think that the
 
00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:47.339 align:start position:0%
classes are handling 75 percent of the
 
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
cases and the non-coses are handling 25
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
of the cases yes okay
 
00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
so the ratio between those is roughly 75
 
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
if we add it all up
 
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:06.420 align:start position:0%
1.526 it is roughly 75 and 25 right so
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
what's hard for me to understand is I
 
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
would think Casas would be a lot cheaper
 
00:15:14.689 --> 00:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
because they're volunteers
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
and they're not so so yeah I I so I'm
 
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
just that's my disconnect
 
00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:23.459 align:start position:0%
um I think you're
 
00:15:23.459 --> 00:15:24.069 align:start position:0%
um I think you're
um

00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:28.129 --> 00:15:28.139 align:start position:0%
identifying something uh that on paper
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
looks like we're comparing apples and
 
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
apples and I think the reason that Casa
 
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
is the preferred provider is because
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
um they are providing Services
 
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
beyond what our expectation or the
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
reality is for the non-costage ales and
 
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
so if we're not only sort of evaluating
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
an hour by hour budget comparison but
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
we're also looking at the quality of
 
00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
what we're getting for our money as
 
00:16:02.569 --> 00:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh or for the services I think
 
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
the general understanding is that Casa
 
00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:08.579 align:start position:0%
is providing a higher quality longer
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
term uh resource but
 
00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:15.009 align:start position:0%
term uh resource but
um

00:16:15.009 --> 00:16:15.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Marsha sink and
 
00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
I'm the CEO of Casa I'm happy to answer
 
00:16:23.689 --> 00:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
any additional questions but I think
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
that Richard has explained fairly well
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
that the difference
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
um and I the handout that I gave you has
 
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
some relevant numbers in terms of the
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
cases that we were able to take the
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
numbers of children we served and things
 
00:16:40.129 --> 00:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
like the
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
um the number of contacts that our Casas
 
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
had with the children on their cases
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
they they contacted them over 20 000
 
00:16:47.699 --> 00:16:49.129 align:start position:0%
they they contacted them over 20 000
times

00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:49.139 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
um they are our Advocates are required
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
to see every child that they're
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
appointed to at least once a month many
 
00:16:59.090 --> 00:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
of them do that more frequently they are
 
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
appointed to a case which is a sibling
 
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
group that can be one child or it could
 
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:06.140 align:start position:0%
be five or six children
 
00:17:08.409 --> 00:17:08.419 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
incredibly dedicated to this work and
 
00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
um citizens from across the state of
 
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
which last year we had over 600 that are
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
volunteering of their time and resources
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure of the organization
 
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.510 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure of the organization
however

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
needs to continue that recruitment the
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
retention the uh very comprehensive and
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
lengthy training that they go through
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
initially ongoing in-service training
 
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
and support throughout the the life of
 
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
their time as a casa our Casas typically
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
um there as I sort of call it their life
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
expectancy with Casa is a little over
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
four years and our the average length of
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
any one of our cases is about two and a
 
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
half years we have Casas that have been
 
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
with us for 15 20 years and those that
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
will take one case and decide that it
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
isn't the right volunteer work for them
 
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.710 align:start position:0%
isn't the right volunteer work for them
so

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
um we're we're constantly getting the
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
word out and trying to recruit to
 
00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
ultimately reach our goal of serving 100
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
of the children in New Hampshire that
 
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.710 align:start position:0%
of the children in New Hampshire that
need

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:11.720 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
Acasa Guardian Ad Litem on the child
 
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect cases
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you so
 
00:18:24.529 --> 00:18:24.539 align:start position:0%
um is was he right when he said that
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
um Casas spend more hours in a case than
 
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
these non-casa abuse and neglect
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
category absolutely absolutely and and
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
the other thing I'd point out is that
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
Casas only carry one or two cases at a
 
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
time and the pay gals that are absorbing
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
the cases that we can cannot take are
 
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
carrying much larger caseloads so
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
they're not they don't have
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
um the opportunity to meet as frequently
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
with the children or spend as much time
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
on each individual case as our
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
volunteers do gotcha okay and so I you
 
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
don't have any kind of upper limit for
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
the number of volunteers right you're
 
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
constantly looking for perfect people so
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
you have all that want to do it
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
basically or were constantly looking for
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
more because you know people life
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
changes and um they have to
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
um resign from the organization but our
 
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
classes typically are staying with this
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
particular case or children from the
 
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:24.299 align:start position:0%
very beginning their appointment through
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
the termination of parental rights if
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's so it's the same case for us
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
where as for the judicial Council the
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
pagios it's two separate separate cases
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
so let's focus on the non-costals
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
because that one you want the budget to
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
more than double yeah so I think uh
 
00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:45.380 align:start position:0%
to begin that conversation it's probably
 
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
important for you to know that we have a
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
pending request with the governor and
 
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
Council and with fiscal for an
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
additional 187
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
500 in order to pay our current bills
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
for non-casa gals and so if that gets
 
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
approved the revised budget would be 354
 
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
656 which is closer in line to the 400
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
000 that is being requested
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
I should explain in part that part of
 
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
the reason for that increase is the rate
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
change that has gone into effect in
 
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.110 align:start position:0%
change that has gone into effect in
October

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
October
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
so while we're
 
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.289 align:start position:0%
so while we're
um

00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:30.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
covering that rate change there is an
 
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
expectation that we haven't fully seen
 
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
the manifestation of it in our bills yet
 
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
because cases are still getting closed
 
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:43.500 align:start position:0%
some of those cases uh have billing from
 
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
before the rule change so that's the
 
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
basis for the four hundred thousand
 
00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.390 align:start position:0%
basis for the four hundred thousand
dollars

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
are you paying hourly yes that's correct
 
00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
and what's the new rate it's ninety
 
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:55.850 align:start position:0%
and what's the new rate it's ninety
dollars

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
so I I think uh representative McGuire's
 
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
question sort of addresses what I would
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
tell you about non-casa Guardians at
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
Litem the third category here of uh the
 
00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem fund just so uh the
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
committee is over of the understanding
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
of what they do they are providing
 
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
Guardian services in a variety of cases
 
00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:28.039 align:start position:0%
but they would be
 
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
including adult guardianships and
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
guardianships of children but also
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
expenses in those cases so this line
 
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
which is 1092 and again it's on the
 
00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
governor's budget at page 539
 
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
we have also uh a pending request for
 
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
additional funds of 299
 
00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
000 in order to pay current invoices and
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
pay for services through the end of
 
00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2023 and that'll result in a
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
revised budget of uh 849
 
00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:06.419 align:start position:0%
000 for fiscal year 2023.
 
00:22:06.419 --> 00:22:07.029 align:start position:0%
000 for fiscal year 2023.
um

00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
so I uh will note for you that the
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
request there
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
um is for
 
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.390 align:start position:0%
um is for
uh

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
1 million uh 8 000 basically and again
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
just like the other category of expenses
 
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
I was referring to there's a increase
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
here in terms of the rate there's an
 
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
increase in the cap that can be paid per
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
case and the other thing that's
 
00:22:36.049 --> 00:22:36.059 align:start position:0%
important to know is the expenses
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
portion that's covered by that line was
 
00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
something that was new to the judicial
 
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:43.460 align:start position:0%
Council in
 
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
2021 so that's where we get that request
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
for the one million dollar budget line
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh if uh there's no further questions
 
00:22:59.330 --> 00:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
for uh for Casa from async or with
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
respect to the child protection category
 
00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
I would move on to the area of indigent
 
00:23:03.659 --> 00:23:08.510 align:start position:0%
I would move on to the area of indigent
defense

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:12.169 --> 00:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
so the Indigent defense account lines
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
cover four different categories
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
this fulfills the state's funding of
 
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
indigent defense that is mandated by the
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
federal and state constitutions
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
and to provide criminal representation
 
00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:31.500 align:start position:0%
to those who cannot afford it in adult
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
criminal cases and in juvenile cases
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
delinquency cases
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have a three-tiered
 
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.770 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we have a three-tiered
system

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
uh that system consists of in the first
 
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
instance appointing the public defender
 
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.529 align:start position:0%
instance appointing the public defender
program

00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
cases the public defender program cannot
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
accept then go to what are called
 
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
contract Council these are lawyers who
 
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
have a contract with the judicial
 
00:23:58.130 --> 00:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
Council who represent people in these
 
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
cases on a flat fee basis
 
00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:03.740 align:start position:0%
when contract counsel is not available
 
00:24:06.409 --> 00:24:06.419 align:start position:0%
we then go to the third tier which is
 
00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
assigned Council assigned counsel or
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
compensated on an hourly basis and like
 
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
the other categories we've talked about
 
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
here the assigned Council rates have
 
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
been increased I'll explain in more
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
detail in a moment why it was so
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
important to increase those but I think
 
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
the starting point that you should know
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
is that those rates were the primary
 
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
rate it was the first time there's been
 
00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:36.059 align:start position:0%
an increase in 30 years at the rate the
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
base rate was set in 1992 at sixty
 
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:41.340 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour and now the base rate is
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
ninety dollars an hour in more serious
 
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
cases it's 125 an hour still a
 
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
significant reduction from what private
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
Council would be charging in cases like
 
00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.210 align:start position:0%
Council would be charging in cases like
this

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
um the judicial council's priority here
 
00:24:59.690 --> 00:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
uh in this biennial budget submission is
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
funding of the public defender program
 
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
and we're requesting what would be the
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
largest increase in the public
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
defender's history uh over three million
 
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
dollars for each year the biennium
 
00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:12.539 align:start position:0%
to explain the need for that I have to
 
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
begin by telling you that the public
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
defender is the backbone of the Indigent
 
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
defense system in a typical year the
 
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:21.059 align:start position:0%
public defender program would handle
 
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
about 85 percent of the Indigent defense
 
00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.090 align:start position:0%
about 85 percent of the Indigent defense
caseload

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:25.100 align:start position:0%
caseload
 
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
historically contract lawyers which is
 
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
that second tier would handle about
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
another 14 percent and then a signed
 
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
Council would handle the remaining one
 
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.230 align:start position:0%
Council would handle the remaining one
percent

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:25:39.169 --> 00:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
the last three years have been anything
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
but typical years
 
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:45.480 align:start position:0%
and in fiscal year uh 22 the public
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
defender was only able to handle about
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
80 percent of that caseload so although
 
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's only a five percent decrease uh
 
00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
the ripple effect on the on the system
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
has been huge uh High staff turnovers at
 
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
the public defender K uh office and uh
 
00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
fewer cases getting resolved during the
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic led to a backlog of cases uh an
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
extremely high case loads when the
 
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
governor declared the State of Emergency
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
on March 13th of 2020
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
between that moment in time and when the
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%
budget was submitted from this agency
 
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
back in the fall the public defender had
 
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
49 attorneys resign from their program
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
that represented not just a percentage
 
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:34.500 align:start position:0%
of the lawyers they have there but a
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
significant percentage of their work
 
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
experience it was a total of
 
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:42.620 align:start position:0%
443 years of combined work experience
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
during that same period they've hired
 
00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:48.539 align:start position:0%
new lawyers 55 new lawyers during that
 
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
time period with a combined 123 years of
 
00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:54.299 align:start position:0%
experience but that's not quite enough
 
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
to offset the difference there's a
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
handout in the materials I provided last
 
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
week which shows that sort of
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
change and experience level
 
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine ex new lawyers for
 
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
the most part don't enter
 
00:27:12.169 --> 00:27:12.179 align:start position:0%
with the ability to handle the same
 
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
level or same number of cases that their
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
experienced counterparts have the same
 
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
way that a first-year resident at a
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
hospital probably isn't going to be
 
00:27:24.529 --> 00:27:24.539 align:start position:0%
doing any brain surgery or heart
 
00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:27.799 align:start position:0%
transplants the shift in experiences
 
00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
coincided with increasingly complex
 
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
cases and that is part of the basis of
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
this request as well
 
00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
the seismic shift in experience level is
 
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.970 align:start position:0%
the seismic shift in experience level is
also

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:42.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
supplemented or complemented by an
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
increased need to spend time on cases
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
increased need for resources for those
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
cases and the assistance of what has
 
00:27:59.090 --> 00:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
become the norm in this industry so to
 
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
speak of having the assistance of social
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
workers and paralegals who can assist
 
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
with complex cases and electronic
 
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
evidence and when I say electronic
 
00:28:12.769 --> 00:28:12.779 align:start position:0%
evidence I mean not only digital
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
evidence but video evidence which is
 
00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:17.900 align:start position:0%
becoming not only more common but almost
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
commonplace in every one of these cases
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
evaluating those evidence uh that
 
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:25.980 align:start position:0%
evidence and making it into a usable
 
00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:28.700 align:start position:0%
form and then the Court's expectation
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
that the public defender will use its
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
resources to come up with plans for
 
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
individuals in terms of treatment plans
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
at the outset so there is a significant
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
amount of resources being spent not only
 
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
on legal litigation but on
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
representation in a way that provides
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
resources to this population so that
 
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
courts can act in a way that provides
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
them Services through the judicial
 
00:28:59.039 --> 00:29:00.590 align:start position:0%
them Services through the judicial
system

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.310 align:start position:0%
system
foreign

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
so I have a quick question on page 15.
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious in the numbers here uh
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
it notes that the judicial Council also
 
00:29:11.159 --> 00:29:12.529 align:start position:0%
it notes that the judicial Council also
anticipates

00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:12.539 align:start position:0%
anticipates
 
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
that the Youth Development Center
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecutions will generate
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
significant additional non-counsel costs
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
over the next biennium yes do you have a
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
specific dollar amount that you
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
anticipate or the number of individuals
 
00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:30.179 align:start position:0%
that are going to seek legal counsel to
 
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
defend themselves against charges there
 
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
so those charges have been filed those
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
cases are pending there are 11 different
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
defendants in those cases 10 pertain
 
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
specifically to YDC one to what was
 
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:45.860 align:start position:0%
called ydsu
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
the state the Attorney General's office
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
has spent close to two million dollars
 
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:54.539 align:start position:0%
on Discovery in that case in terms of
 
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
organizing Discovery the reason they've
 
00:29:59.930 --> 00:29:59.940 align:start position:0%
done that is there's about 30 million
 
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
pages of discovery
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
uh it's unprecedented in this case in
 
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
this state uh and frankly anywhere so
 
00:30:12.529 --> 00:30:12.539 align:start position:0%
the the those 30 million pages of
 
00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
Discovery that's correct always so that
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
is being organized what has happened is
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
that the defense Council that are
 
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
representing those 11 individuals have
 
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
collectively presented a plan to the
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
court uh in terms of Discovery
 
00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.389 align:start position:0%
court uh in terms of Discovery
management

00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
um there are some numbers the court is
 
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
still deciding uh which plan it is going
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
to authorize but the expectation is that
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
if it uh accepts the plan that the
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
defense Council collectively have
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
proposed it would be uh probably uh
 
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
at least two hundred thousand dollars
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
over the next 18 months which candidly
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
is far far less than uh I think the
 
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
judicial Council anticipated it might be
 
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
um but it's it's a concern on the
 
00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
horizon and then the cost for Council in
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
those cases is going to be a significant
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
concern under the assigned Council line
 
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:10.820 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner you're welcome to
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
join us up here I know you're very
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
familiar with the judicial Council and
 
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:22.100 align:start position:0%
Caso especially
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt's spot if you want
 
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
I think all the documentation you may
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin has a question
 
00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:40.740 align:start position:0%
the question are we dealing as far as
 
00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
the public defender is concerned are we
 
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
dealing only with State cases here or or
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
does it get down to the county level too
 
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.029 align:start position:0%
does it get down to the county level too
so

00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you for the question
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
um what we're talking about here is
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
cases that are filed in the circuit
 
00:32:00.889 --> 00:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
courts of New Hampshire in the Superior
 
00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
Courts of New Hampshire and at the New
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court so it's all
 
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
criminal cases across the state
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
are that they are prosecuted at the
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
county level certainly some of those but
 
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's only state cases no federal cases
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
or anything like that
 
00:32:21.649 --> 00:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
not seeing any welcome to continue thank
 
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
you um so just to uh complete uh what I
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
think it's important to know about this
 
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
request for the public defender uh this
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
is going to allow a 10 salary increase
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
that was put into effect in April to
 
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
continue uh that's critical to them
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
retaining staff and putting them on
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
parity with what other
 
00:32:48.649 --> 00:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
prosecutors in the state are making both
 
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
at the county level and at the state
 
00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:51.310 align:start position:0%
at the county level and at the state
level

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:51.320 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
it will fund also some additional steps
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
for lawyers in terms of retention so
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
previously there were only 12 steps that
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
a lawyer could get to the new leadership
 
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
at the public defender's office which
 
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
has been very Dynamic and responsive to
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
trying to solve these problems has put
 
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
into place up to 15 Steps with the idea
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
of retaining some of those experienced
 
00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
lawyers there would be an additional
 
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
five percent salary increase again
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
necessary to remain competitive compared
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
to prosecutors positions and other
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
people who are leaving for the private
 
00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
sector and it would create eight new I.T
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
paralegal positions and allow for
 
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
similar I.T upgrades to address what I
 
00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:39.419 align:start position:0%
was explaining before sort of this new
 
00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:42.779 align:start position:0%
normal in criminal representation of a
 
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:44.700 align:start position:0%
high degree of electronic Discovery
 
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
video discovery
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
the ability to manage it at a local
 
00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:51.190 align:start position:0%
the ability to manage it at a local
level

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
so again this funding increase is not
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
alone going to solve I think the
 
00:33:59.450 --> 00:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
Indigent defense crisis that we've been
 
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:02.220 align:start position:0%
experiencing here but it's difficult to
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
imagine how we get through it and get to
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
the other side of it without this
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
additional funding and the hope is that
 
00:34:13.129 --> 00:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
this will allow us to restore and
 
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.419 align:start position:0%
correct sort of the imbalance that's
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
been in place in the last three years so
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
again this is not an additional funding
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
request that is aimed at expanding
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
services this is a request that is aimed
 
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
at maintaining and restoring services to
 
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
the place that they were prior to the
 
00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:35.450 align:start position:0%
the place that they were prior to the
pandemic

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
I have a quick question on the I.T part
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
are you working with our doit or are
 
00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
these independent within your Council so
 
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to have Sarah Rothman who is
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
the director of the uh
 
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
public defender program answer that but
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
I would tell you that this is not
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire
 
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
doit program
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
so have you reached out to the
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
commission to see if he can help you and
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
maybe cut some of your costs or
 
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
uh um I I will defer but I I should just
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
say that you know I think there would it
 
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
would be highly problematic to have the
 
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire who prosecutes
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
defendants involved in the management of
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
Discovery for defendants I think that
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
would be a conflict
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire does have a quick
 
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
question I believe she wanted to come I
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question further I I I
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
definitely agree with with Richard
 
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
um that you know that we have to manage
 
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
our own Discovery but I will say
 
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
um we do work closely with the courts um
 
00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
on technology issues we're actually in
 
00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:38.579 align:start position:0%
Communications with the ports
 
00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
um to actually essentially have our two
 
00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:44.339 align:start position:0%
Case Management Systems merge together
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
um so the idea being right now the case
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
the court sends us essentially physical
 
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
paperwork they might send it
 
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
electronically but it's essentially
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
physical paperwork then we take that in
 
00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
our support staff processes that they
 
00:35:59.450 --> 00:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
open a case they they calendar events
 
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
for their attorneys we are hoping to
 
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
actually integrate our systems so that
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
when the port sends us a case it
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
actually Auto populates in our own
 
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.530 align:start position:0%
actually Auto populates in our own
system

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:11.579 align:start position:0%
um to save us resources on you know
 
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
support staff time but additional
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
resources so while certainly we do need
 
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
to manage our own I.T departments and
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
manage the storage and organization of
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
our voluminous Discovery ourselves we
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
also do look to the courts for ways to
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
work together and to create efficiencies
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
so I guess your response led me to
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
another question how many people are
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
embedded now in your I.T
 
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
so we have an I.T manager and then we
 
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
have four IT staff
 
00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
so you're looking you said eight eight
 
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.170 align:start position:0%
so you're looking you said eight eight
new

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
new
 
00:36:47.569 --> 00:36:47.579 align:start position:0%
to clarify those are not those are
 
00:36:50.089 --> 00:36:50.099 align:start position:0%
paralegal positions so they're not I.T
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
you know they're not just to help us run
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
our I.T Department they're actually to
 
00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
work on individual cases there are new
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
technology tools many of which are are
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
too expensive for us that are designed
 
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
to kind of take electronic Discovery
 
00:37:08.349 --> 00:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
index it make it searchable the most
 
00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
expensive Technologies while also
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
transcribe video so now virtually almost
 
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
every case of ours now includes video of
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
some sort officers are now wearing body
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
worn cameras there's a lot of
 
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
surveillance video most people have you
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
know ring cameras businesses homes a lot
 
00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
of security footage there's also a great
 
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
deal of cell phone information so they
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
will take literally all of the data from
 
00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
somebody's cell phone and just give it
 
00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
to you essentially in paper form and so
 
00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
the paralegals are there so they're not
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
they're not really I.T employees they're
 
00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:48.060 align:start position:0%
there to work on individual cases and to
 
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
organize that Discovery to digest it on
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
behalf of attorneys so if you're getting
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know 20 30 hours of video in sort of
 
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
a run-of-the-mill case
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
um you know the paralegal can watch that
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
and the attorney can give them Direction
 
00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
on what they're looking for in these
 
00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
videos so these paralegal positions are
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
really crucial in dealing with this
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
spike in technology
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
discovery that we now received we now
 
00:38:13.079 --> 00:38:14.630 align:start position:0%
discovery that we now received we now
receive

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
receive
 
00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:17.420 align:start position:0%
um I what by my I had RIT Department
 
00:38:20.329 --> 00:38:20.339 align:start position:0%
look at the amount of data that we now
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
store so data in terms of discovery that
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
we receive from the state that has
 
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
increased by uh 566 percent
 
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
um in just the last five years so those
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
paralegal positions are not really just
 
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
to deal with the I.T of all of that it's
 
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
to process the information to make it
 
00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
available for the attorney and to work
 
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
closely with the attorney as a team to
 
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:47.060 align:start position:0%
talk call this voluminous Discovery
 
00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:49.380 align:start position:0%
could you provide us with like a
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
organization chart how many people are
 
00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
in I.T and the paralegal that would be
 
00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
very helpful and what new positions
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
would be uh included in your budget
 
00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
request in that chart yes and I can
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
clarify we actually don't currently have
 
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
any paralegal positions we're looking
 
00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
if I could just add so page 13 of the
 
00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:17.579 align:start position:0%
handout is a visual representation of
 
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
that increase in Discovery electronic
 
00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
Discovery the other thing I think it's
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
probably important for you to know is
 
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
the Superior Courts are moving to an
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
electronic evidence system so you know
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
the days of watching a lawyer walk up to
 
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
a witness with a piece of paper or a
 
00:39:35.569 --> 00:39:35.579 align:start position:0%
document and say you know can you answer
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
some questions about this those are
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
those days are are going away and the
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
courts have moved to an electronic
 
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
system where documents have to be filed
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
in advance and they have to be referred
 
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
to so the need I think that the public
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
defender has for electronic uh I'm sorry
 
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
I.T paralegals is
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
consistent with the trend in the courts
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
to work from electronic evidence and to
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
manage evidence electronically
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGuire
 
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:10.550 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
so this says that this covers 85 percent
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
of the cases are the other 15 percent in
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
some other section of this budget so
 
00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:21.410 align:start position:0%
some other section of this budget so
um

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
if I wasn't clear before in in the good
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
old days the public defender uh took 85
 
00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
percent of the cases
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
um it has decreased to about 80 percent
 
00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
but they are um I think under the new
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
leadership they're experiencing they are
 
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
working their way back and things are
 
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
moving in the right direction
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
um the other 15 15 to 20 right right is
 
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
handled by contract Council so again in
 
00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:49.940 align:start position:0%
the good old days they would handle 14
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
of that other 15 that's not happening
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
anymore either we've lost about eight of
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
the uh 34 contract Wars we've we have so
 
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
we're trying to lure more people into
 
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
the contract system but what it really
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
means is that last one percent that had
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
been handled by assigned Council the
 
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
hourly rate attorneys they're handling a
 
00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
much higher percentage of the cases than
 
00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
they used to and because they're
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
handling those cases on an hourly basis
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
and because uh the need to attract
 
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
people to take those cases was so dire
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
the court finally increased the rate and
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
I have to say I have to thank the
 
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
governor and his office for their
 
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
support there because otherwise we would
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
have no lawyers
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
um so that used to be one percent I
 
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
don't know what the current percentage
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
is but I can tell you it's a lot higher
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah so back to the budget so
 
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
this 27 million is 85 or possibly 80
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
right somewhere in there
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
then the contract ones are they
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in this budget right so
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
that is line 1093 uh that would be page
 
00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
540 of the budget uh it's page nine of
 
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
the handout that okay so that's 2.6
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
million correct and youth say those are
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
15 or something ideally it would be 14
 
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
14 and then there's a one percent
 
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.140 align:start position:0%
somewhere else right well it's not one
 
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
percent but so that's a signed Council
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh that's uh on page 5 for 38 of the
 
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.490 align:start position:0%
uh that's uh on page 5 for 38 of the
budget

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
um so uh sort of accelerating to to that
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
item uh I would tell you that
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
um we have already had to go back and we
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
have had approved from uh the governor
 
00:42:50.569 --> 00:42:50.579 align:start position:0%
and Council and from fiscal uh an
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
additional 1.6 million dollar request so
 
00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
that we can pay uh assigned Council for
 
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 that revised budget is
 
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
now uh over three million dollars
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
and uh like I've said uh in other
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
categories because the rate change went
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
into effect at the beginning of October
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
we haven't necessarily seen the full
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
manifestation of that new rate
 
00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
even more so than the other categories
 
00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:23.420 align:start position:0%
of cases were we've been talking about
 
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh cases criminal cases billing
 
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
typically doesn't occur until the end of
 
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
the case in those cases the longevity of
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
the lifespan of those cases is is a bit
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
longer so I'm anticipating we're going
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
to see a big increase there we have seen
 
00:43:43.329 --> 00:43:43.339 align:start position:0%
steady increases in the amount of
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
invoices we're paying every month in the
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
assigned Council category
 
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
um and the the truth is that we're also
 
00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
seeing more assigned Council in what are
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
more serious cases so there's a slightly
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
higher rate there but if we're talking
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh about homicides or sexual assault
 
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
cases uh or the YDC cases
 
00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
um you know those are cases that are
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
taking an extensive amount of time and
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
if we have to assign counsel to those
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
cases we're paying a lot of money to
 
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
those lawyers to provide the
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
representation in those cases the last
 
00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
thing I would just add about that is you
 
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
know I've attached to the handout that I
 
00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
provided to you in some articles news
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
articles that addressed
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh sort of a crisis uh at its height and
 
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
the involvement of the Supreme Court
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
um you know I I need to thank the Chief
 
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:43.740 align:start position:0%
Justice and all the judges on the court
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
for creating a task force on Indigent
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
defense but I mean that is the sort of
 
00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
the state that we got to that the Chief
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Supreme Court had to go
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
and make calls to individual lawyers to
 
00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
ask them to take cases because things
 
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
were were that bad
 
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
mayor father yeah so
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
just in general
 
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
are the are the public defenders cases
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
roughly equivalent in terms of
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
difficulty on average to the contract
 
00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
Council cases to the assigned Council
 
00:45:20.089 --> 00:45:20.099 align:start position:0%
cases are not quite oh I think they are
 
00:45:22.849 --> 00:45:22.859 align:start position:0%
the most difficult of the cases I mean
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
they have the the they are handling the
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
bulk of the homicides they are handling
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the aggravated
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
sexual assault cases they have the staff
 
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
who does that the the problem is if you
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
have a co-defendants in a case they can
 
00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
only take one of those cases if they
 
00:45:41.569 --> 00:45:41.579 align:start position:0%
have a conflict of interest professional
 
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest we have to find
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
someone else to take that case
 
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
and if they can't take cases because
 
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
they're senior lawyers instead of having
 
00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
70 cases which is already a high number
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
have 90 or 100 cases then we have to go
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
and find other lawyers to take those
 
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
cases so what the hope is over the next
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
biennium is we can move from sort of
 
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
this crisis to and to full Staffing at
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
the public defender that they can work
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
back to that 85 percent and that the
 
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
need for assigned cases it's assigned
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
Council cases will drop again but that
 
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
is not going to happen tomorrow and
 
00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
um you know if I'm being realistic about
 
00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
it I think it's going to take the best
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
the majority of the biennium to work
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
through it so what's the difference
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
what's a contract person I mean but both
 
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
of them are full-time yes but they're
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
but they're no so nope so the public
 
00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.490 align:start position:0%
but they're no so nope so the public
defender

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
defender
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
has a full-time staff they yes work for
 
00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
the public defender they only work
 
00:46:50.809 --> 00:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
they're paid salary yes okay contract
 
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
Council are lawyers who have their own
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
offices who take a contract with the
 
00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
judicial Council to provide legal
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
services and they agree to take we
 
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
designate cases by units they they take
 
00:47:08.089 --> 00:47:08.099 align:start position:0%
X number of units per year uh when they
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
reach their unit Mark we can ask them to
 
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
take more cases they don't have to agree
 
00:47:14.329 --> 00:47:14.339 align:start position:0%
to do that they've exceeded their
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
contract at that point the other
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
difference is they can refuse cases they
 
00:47:19.130 --> 00:47:19.140 align:start position:0%
don't have to take a case if they don't
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
want to but those are contract lawyers
 
00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%
who have other practices as well and
 
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
they're paid on a flat fee basis per
 
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.710 align:start position:0%
they're paid on a flat fee basis per
case

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
that third tier the assigned Council
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
they're not in either of those category
 
00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:35.220 align:start position:0%
they're again in lawyers working in
 
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:37.980 align:start position:0%
their own offices who on occasion are
 
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
agreeable to taking representation and
 
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
providing representation in cases and so
 
00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:45.140 align:start position:0%
again we're
 
00:47:48.609 --> 00:47:48.619 align:start position:0%
literally calling people every day
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
asking them to take cases so the public
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
defender has a conflict case
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
administrator they make those calls but
 
00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
I can tell you on Tuesday I called three
 
00:47:59.569 --> 00:47:59.579 align:start position:0%
lawyers asking them to take cases
 
00:48:02.089 --> 00:48:02.099 align:start position:0%
probably not what the head of an agency
 
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
should spend a lot of time doing but
 
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
that's sort of what what is the current
 
00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:07.809 align:start position:0%
that's sort of what what is the current
situation

00:48:07.809 --> 00:48:07.819 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind if I can add just a
 
00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
few thoughts to your thank you last few
 
00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.130 align:start position:0%
few thoughts to your thank you last few
questions

00:48:13.130 --> 00:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
um so the vast majority of cases that go
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
on to either contract Council or
 
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
assigned Council are because of a
 
00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest as Richard just
 
00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:21.900 align:start position:0%
indicated so those are cases because of
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
the rules of professional conduct we
 
00:48:25.910 --> 00:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
just cannot accept curious as of the
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
cases and as Richard indicated
 
00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
um you know aside from conflict there is
 
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
some that we sometimes have to send out
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
cases because we just don't have the
 
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
Staffing in order to do it but as
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
Richard indicated that tide is turning
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
um and we are back
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
um you know back to keeping
 
00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
um you know still sending out conflict
 
00:48:46.609 --> 00:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
cases cases we just are not allowed to
 
00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
represent but back to keeping um you
 
00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:51.420 align:start position:0%
know the majority of those cases and
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
we've drastically reduced just sending
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
out cases because we can't we can't
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
handle them okay man so units
 
00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
is is it like a car theft case is three
 
00:49:08.809 --> 00:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
units and a a homicide is 25 units or
 
00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
something like that is is that how it
 
00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
works yeah that's a that's a way to
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
think about it so homicide cases really
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
aren't units they're sort of a unique
 
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:20.300 align:start position:0%
category okay but um yeah felony cases
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh most felony cases are valued at a
 
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
certain number of units misdemeanor
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
cases are valued at a certain number of
 
00:49:30.109 --> 00:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
units then there's a what's called a
 
00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
felony one category which is a
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
serious felony category that gets a
 
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
higher number of units but that is how
 
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
it works okay so a contract attorney
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
agrees to take this car theft case
 
00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:46.460 align:start position:0%
for a certain dollar amount right
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it gets appealed
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
or whatever right however you know it
 
00:49:53.569 --> 00:49:53.579 align:start position:0%
could be over within a day or it could
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
take three weeks or something right
 
00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
you're you're correct
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
um except for the appeal part that would
 
00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
be a separate uh maybe a new case or a
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
new something I see okay thank you can
 
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
we get some numbers in terms of so many
 
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
cases of
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
that are district court cases so many
 
00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
other Superior Court cases so many that
 
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
are Supreme Court cases maybe or
 
00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:17.809 align:start position:0%
are Supreme Court cases maybe or
um

00:50:17.809 --> 00:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
the public defender does this many cases
 
00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
and the contract is that because on
 
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
paper it looks to me like the contract
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
people are the best value
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
compared to the other two categories so
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
um so I unfortunately have two answers
 
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
for your question but I appreciate you
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
asking uh because it sort of highlights
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
something that's very important uh the
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
judicial branch keeps statistics on case
 
00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
filings of Superior Court filing circuit
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
court filings and they keep statistics
 
00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:51.059 align:start position:0%
on a calendar year basis the judicial
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
Council which is three people does not
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
have staff to keep statistics on
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
the variety of things that I would love
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
to give you information about but don't
 
00:51:05.329 --> 00:51:05.339 align:start position:0%
have those specific numbers so in terms
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
of case filings I could tell you you can
 
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
go to the judicial branch website and
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
it's actually posted the number of
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
felonies and misdemeanors that are filed
 
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
on a given calendar year in terms of uh
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
the cases that the public defender is
 
00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:21.530 align:start position:0%
the cases that the public defender is
taking

00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:22.609 align:start position:0%
taking
um

00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:22.619 --> 00:51:24.470 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
I can tell you
 
00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:27.530 align:start position:0%
I can tell you
um

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
the number of cases that they've taken I
 
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
know that yeah but I can't uh but
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
because the judicial branch tracks
 
00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
filings for misdemeanors and felonies
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
but doesn't separately
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
include juvenile cases and then
 
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
separately accounts appeal cases my
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
estimations of the 80 and 85 percent
 
00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
that is a to be very clear that is a
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
best guess but
 
00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's an accurate guess
 
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
but uh it's not uh Based on data that is
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
available to me through the judicial
 
00:52:04.079 --> 00:52:05.150 align:start position:0%
available to me through the judicial
branch

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
branch
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
so yeah so I know that that there are 17
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
000 circuit court cases or something
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
like that a year but how many are
 
00:52:17.329 --> 00:52:17.339 align:start position:0%
Indigent right so that's what I don't
 
00:52:17.339 --> 00:52:18.410 align:start position:0%
Indigent right so that's what I don't
know

00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:52:19.859 --> 00:52:20.990 align:start position:0%
um so
um

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:24.660 align:start position:0%
uh you know I don't think uh attorney
 
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
Rothman can answer that but I and I but
 
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
she's I'm happy to have her try but I
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
would tell you that uh anecdotally as
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
someone who's practiced in that system
 
00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:39.240 align:start position:0%
for close to 30 years I would say the
 
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
you know it's got to be at least
 
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
80 to 90 percent of the cases are
 
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
Indigent cases I see in all levels yeah
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
okay yes the Superior Court Etc yes
 
00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
and what fraction are criminal versus I
 
00:52:59.930 --> 00:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
could ask the Judiciary right criminal
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
versus civil yeah yes and I I don't have
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
that information and we don't fund those
 
00:53:07.609 --> 00:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
cases you're not funding Indigent civil
 
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
well we talked about legal assistance
 
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
yes last week but other than that we're
 
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:14.220 align:start position:0%
not funding so much all right thank you
 
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
so you've been very generous with your
 
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
time I don't want to uh prolong it
 
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
unless you have more questions I just
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
want to touch on two more things quickly
 
00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099 align:start position:0%
if I could but just a question on a
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
number of people you just referenced you
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
had three people working in the office
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
and I thought I heard you say earlier
 
00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
that you were hoping to hire the
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
so-called I.T paralegal people but I see
 
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
in the budget it still only carries
 
00:53:41.809 --> 00:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
three people those contract workers that
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
you hope to hire I apologize I was not
 
00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:47.339 align:start position:0%
clear the judicial Council the agency
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
we're an agency of three people the
 
00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
public defender's budget is requesting
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
for their organization okay
 
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay we will yeah hundreds yeah
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:07.609 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

00:54:07.609 --> 00:54:07.619 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:54:10.849 --> 00:54:10.859 align:start position:0%
so the I think I have in response to
 
00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:12.059 align:start position:0%
your questions
 
00:54:14.809 --> 00:54:14.819 align:start position:0%
um gone over most of the points I wanted
 
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
to address with respect to the three
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
levels of council the last category of
 
00:54:23.569 --> 00:54:23.579 align:start position:0%
expense which is 1103 and on page 541 of
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
the budget talks about what are called
 
00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
ancillary non-council Services those are
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
Services other than lawyers that are
 
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
provided in cases where a judge makes
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
the determination that the expense is
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
necessary for uh representation in that
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
case so when we were talking before
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
about sort of managing Discovery in the
 
00:54:47.809 --> 00:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
YDC cases it would fall under this
 
00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:50.700 align:start position:0%
category of expense these are expenses
 
00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:53.660 align:start position:0%
that typically include interpreters
 
00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
preparing transcripts
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
evaluations for substance abuse and
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
other mental health evaluations again
 
00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
that's just for the Court's use in
 
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
determining how to respond to cases it's
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
not a treatment an ongoing expense
 
00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh and that is this an area where we've
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
again also had to go back and ask for
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
additional funding there was 1.5 million
 
00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:22.910 align:start position:0%
additional funding there was 1.5 million
dollars

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
further appropriated and the revised
 
00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
budget there is 2.6 million currently
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
which is on par with what our request is
 
00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:35.220 align:start position:0%
for the next biennial
 
00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:38.579 align:start position:0%
the last uh thing I'd like to just
 
00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
address very quickly or just some quick
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
observations I've made as a acting
 
00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:47.460 align:start position:0%
director who's coming in to this agency
 
00:55:49.010 --> 00:55:49.020 align:start position:0%
I've only been here
 
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh two and a half months and I'm coming
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
from the private sector but I will tell
 
00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
you that although my predecessor did not
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
request any sort of additional Staffing
 
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
for this agency it strikes me that this
 
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
is an agency in the next biennium that
 
00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
really should ask for additional
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
Staffing the people there work very hard
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
I think that they are
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
up to facing a lot of challenges going
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
forward but I think the absence of a
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
request for Staffing there really
 
00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:24.380 align:start position:0%
highlights my predecessors
 
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:28.140 align:start position:0%
prioritization of indigent defense and
 
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:29.640 align:start position:0%
the other budget requests we're making
 
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
over the needs of the agency and I think
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
it just speaks a lot to our budget
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
request into the importance of providing
 
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
those funds to
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
people that the agency serves not to the
 
00:56:44.690 --> 00:56:44.700 align:start position:0%
agency itself
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
um they're the one other thing there was
 
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
uh in the original budget request a
 
00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:52.020 align:start position:0%
request for a funding for a second
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
public defender program uh that's not
 
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
part of the governor's request and we
 
00:56:57.890 --> 00:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
certainly respect that
 
00:56:59.329 --> 00:56:59.339 align:start position:0%
um but in terms of some of the questions
 
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
you've asked today about how we get
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
through this uh funding crisis and how
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
we get back to sort of the area we want
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
to be in terms of distribution of who's
 
00:57:12.049 --> 00:57:12.059 align:start position:0%
handling these cases the thought would
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
be that creation of a program like that
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
whether it's in this biennium or in the
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
future might be the the best way to
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.010 --> 00:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
yes if you could come up and take the
 
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:46.309 align:start position:0%
 
congratulations

00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
congratulations
 
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
I should my name is Nina Gardner for
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
those of you who don't know me I was the
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
executive director of the judicial
 
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
Council for 24 years and I retired 11
 
00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
years ago and I'm still here because I
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
care very much I'm still chairman of the
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
judicial Council because I care very
 
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
much about what the judicial Council
 
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
does and what it provides to citizens of
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
our state that need the representation I
 
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
am not a lawyer I'm not married to a
 
00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
lawyer I'm you know I I learned this
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
work doing it but I have to tell you is
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
that where we are now is unprecedentedly
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
challenging it is part of why I think uh
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
Richard's predecessor departed what we
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
are being asked to do to solve the
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
problem of a limited Workforce underpaid
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
people challenging clients who have
 
00:58:35.809 --> 00:58:35.819 align:start position:0%
mental health issues substance abuse
 
00:58:35.819 --> 00:58:37.069 align:start position:0%
mental health issues substance abuse
issues

00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
um the pandemic to deal with has been
 
00:58:42.650 --> 00:58:42.660 align:start position:0%
unprecedented and created the system or
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
situ situation we're in now what I have
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
to say to you is if you do not
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate what the governor has
 
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
proposed we will not go forward we will
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
slide backward and our goal is to try to
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
get back would you just said it over and
 
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
over again to the equilibrium we know in
 
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
new but it is a very challenging
 
00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:04.140 align:start position:0%
changing environment just the role of
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
electronics which I would like to have
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
other people really understand and I
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
think some of you do
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
um that with that electronic and um
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
input of information it just changes the
 
00:59:18.109 --> 00:59:18.119 align:start position:0%
nature of how this work is done making
 
00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:20.339 align:start position:0%
it more complicated take making things
 
00:59:23.329 --> 00:59:23.339 align:start position:0%
take longer so please see that's where
 
00:59:25.849 --> 00:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
we are and the only way forward is with
 
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:28.740 align:start position:0%
your support of an appropriation that
 
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
gives us the tools to go for it these
 
00:59:33.289 --> 00:59:33.299 align:start position:0%
cases will exist whether or not you pay
 
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
for them but you ultimately pay for them
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
one way or the other you pay for them
 
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
either in the most expensive way or in a
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
more appropriate way and and just to say
 
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
one more thing contract Council which
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
has always been a very cost effective
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
way to do the work we can't attract
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
people to do it because the fixed fee
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
rates are so low they get no overhead
 
00:59:59.809 --> 00:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
they have no benefits and these clients
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
are tough to deal with so that which we
 
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
used for all those years the governor
 
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
sununu the first built with the judicial
 
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
Council in 1985 doesn't work very well
 
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
anymore and our goal is to get beyond
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
that in many ways to have two pillars
 
01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:17.660 align:start position:0%
that are more predictable
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
lots of contract attorneys with me for
 
01:00:22.609 --> 01:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
all the time I was here but they've left
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
because we don't pay them enough so I
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
implore you to understand that the
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
budget that you have in front of you
 
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
that the governor has provided is is the
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
footprint forward
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
um is a minimum of what we need to have
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
to work uh to get through this to the
 
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
next biennium
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
and I do want to also say just in in in
 
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
really recognizing how fortunate we were
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
to get Richard to step in
 
01:00:49.609 --> 01:00:49.619 align:start position:0%
um losing our former executive director
 
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
was heartbreaking to me but when you
 
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
realize part of what she was doing every
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
day was begging people to take cases
 
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
um it's just emotionally exhausting and
 
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
I'm so appreciative for what she did
 
01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
Richard is stepping in from his private
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
practice to do this
 
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
um and so I again just want to say the
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
appropriation is is vital to the agency
 
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
you've all become friends in my life I
 
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
guess representative McGuire has a
 
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
question yeah actually too but
 
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned contract counsel so
 
01:01:26.809 --> 01:01:26.819 align:start position:0%
does this budget include higher rates
 
01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:29.579 align:start position:0%
for them or no I don't see it on this
 
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
page it doesn't specifically include
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
that I mean certainly our hope that we
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
can offer them more we have in the past
 
01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
biennium uh offered some additional
 
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
funding to take on cases uh for people
 
01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:44.339 align:start position:0%
who are incarcerated and some
 
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
administrative costs but it's really a
 
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
token cost I I can tell you that I spent
 
01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
11 years as a public defender then I
 
01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:54.260 align:start position:0%
went into private practice when I did so
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh Nina was kind enough to give me a
 
01:01:59.690 --> 01:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
contract and I took it and was happy to
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
have that monthly income coming in but
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
as soon as I was able I got rid of the
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
contract because it's not cost effective
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
to run a business uh with the contract
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that's the problem we see is that
 
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
the people who
 
01:02:17.089 --> 01:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
um are successful lawyers are abandoned
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
the contract because it's it's just not
 
01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
financially it doesn't make sense to run
 
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
a business that way and I just want to
 
01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:26.220 align:start position:0%
comment the other piece of the contract
 
01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.849 align:start position:0%
comment the other piece of the contract
program

01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.859 --> 01:02:30.349 align:start position:0%
 
incentive

01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
the time into these k cases that is
 
01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:35.579 align:start position:0%
necessary if we give you a flat fee what
 
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
is a misdemeanor these days Richard it's
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
350. we pay 75 375 a lawyer gets paid
 
01:02:44.210 --> 01:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
375 dollars to take on a misdemeanor
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
case if you go to court several times
 
01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
three or four times you've eaten it they
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
don't get mileage they they just it's
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's flat fee and for young lawyers
 
01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
starting out a while ago 1985 that was
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
probably a good deal the problem is it's
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
not a good deal anymore and so we are
 
01:03:05.569 --> 01:03:05.579 align:start position:0%
trying to find a way
 
01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
um to morph out of that system
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
um because it's the disincentive to do
 
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
the a good amount of work that's
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
necessary is really problematic a lot of
 
01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
states have given up contract programs
 
01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:18.589 align:start position:0%
states have given up contract programs
because

01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
as well as the money
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
so are you saying you'd find it easier
 
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
to hire more for the public defender's
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
office than to find more contract people
 
01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
well I I think in
 
01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
first of all the contract uh Council
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
versus public defender it's not
 
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
it's not the right comparison in the
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
sense that the public defender is going
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
to have some conflict cases like they
 
01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
will never be able to handle 100 sure so
 
01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
it's got to go somewhere and right now
 
01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
that's the contract lawyer program but
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know if you asked me
 
01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:57.109 align:start position:0%
you know if you asked me
um

01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
is that the the best way to do it is
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
that do I see it in 10 years as uh still
 
01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
being here as the effective method I I
 
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
don't I mean it's just not going to be
 
01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
the way we move forward on those cases
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
and and ideally there would be an
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
alternative public defender program that
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
would take those conflict cases and
 
01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
there would be a very small amount of
 
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
assigned Council cases
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean there's no reason you
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
couldn't have public defender firm
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
number one and public defender firm
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
number two right I mean absolutely and
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
that is what the requests that we had in
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget was about was to
 
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
create this alternative program so that
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
we could morph away from the contract
 
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.370 align:start position:0%
we could morph away from the contract
program

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:39.299 align:start position:0%
um and there's a corridor um in New
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where the bulk of the cases
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
are that is where we can probably try to
 
01:04:44.569 --> 01:04:44.579 align:start position:0%
do an alternative public defender you
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't try to do get it to go all the
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
way up north
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
um because it's the number of cases up
 
01:04:50.510 --> 01:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
there are so much smaller it's best
 
01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
served with individual attorneys but
 
01:04:56.690 --> 01:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
that is where we're trying to head so I
 
01:04:59.569 --> 01:04:59.579 align:start position:0%
I sense that you you understand where we
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
think we are which is number one in
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
crisis and the key out of this place is
 
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
with the appropriation from the
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
governor's budget as much as you can do
 
01:05:11.049 --> 01:05:11.059 align:start position:0%
that all right
 
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
okay this is the big picture question so
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
the the population of our prisons is
 
01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:20.339 align:start position:0%
declining the the population of New
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is aging is the amount of
 
01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:24.059 align:start position:0%
crime and therefore the amount of work
 
01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:26.940 align:start position:0%
for this office declining
 
01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:28.609 align:start position:0%
for this office declining
so

01:05:28.609 --> 01:05:28.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
um case filings uh definitely are
 
01:05:36.049 --> 01:05:36.059 align:start position:0%
trending downward uh but in terms of
 
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
your prison population question I mean I
 
01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:40.619 align:start position:0%
would give a lot of credit to the
 
01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
lawyers who handle the cases now this
 
01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:44.579 align:start position:0%
now provide and the court system the
 
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
judicial branch for creating
 
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
alternatives to incarceration for people
 
01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
that that may not need it not to say we
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
don't need prisons there are certainly
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
people that that need to be there but
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of more thought that
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
has been given to alternatives to that
 
01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:05.339 align:start position:0%
but to answer your question uh I I think
 
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
it depends where case trends go in the
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
next five years and if the
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
arrests go up then the need for Council
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
is going to go up
 
01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
um and if it goes down if crime
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
decreases arrests decrease well then I
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
think we'll be in a better position to
 
01:06:24.829 --> 01:06:24.839 align:start position:0%
address all of those needs I I did not
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
mention to you and I
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
omitted that there's been a there's a
 
01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:30.980 align:start position:0%
hold list for the first time in history
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
cases that are not yet assigned to
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
anyone in those three categories and at
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
one point it was a thousand cases back
 
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
in August and since the new
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
Administration has come into the public
 
01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
defender uh it's now to about 600 and
 
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know that's a lot of people but that
 
01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:52.140 align:start position:0%
is a significant Improvement and so once
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
we get through those 600 I then I'll be
 
01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
happy to come back and answer your
 
01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
question again
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
and I should mention never in my 24
 
01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:02.870 align:start position:0%
and I should mention never in my 24
years

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
four years available to be assigned and
 
01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
it speaks to the kind of the factors the
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
cost now I also want to make a clear
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
lots of folks are not going to law
 
01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
school these days the practice of law is
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
not as appealing as it once was I think
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
it's all in technology uh you know I
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
think a lot of things have changed so
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
significantly that this issue that we're
 
01:07:26.690 --> 01:07:26.700 align:start position:0%
facing is Nationwide public defender
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
programs around the country are facing
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
similar challenges and so you know we
 
01:07:33.529 --> 01:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
are one of many
 
01:07:35.329 --> 01:07:35.339 align:start position:0%
um experiencing this all we care about
 
01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
is here
 
01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:39.299 align:start position:0%
with you and
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you for letting me speak
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
representative pleasure well thank you
 
01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
but I I did have a question I don't want
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
to become like representative McGuire my
 
01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:49.799 align:start position:0%
dear friend to the left of me here but
 
01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
I'm curious why you didn't include any
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
increase in the rate under the public
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
defenders program for Contract Services
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
I think you mentioned 350 dollars for Mr
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
Mina charge the attorney gets I see it's
 
01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
gone up substantially but you said that
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
you hadn't built in like a cost increase
 
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
for a contract so I I think what you're
 
01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
referring to is the account line for
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
contract Council so not the public
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
defender but uh there is a an increase
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
there and I think it's our hope one is
 
01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
continue with some of the incentives
 
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
we've provided to take the cases of that
 
01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
are people who are incarcerated that
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're less willing to take normally
 
01:08:37.849 --> 01:08:37.859 align:start position:0%
and some of the administrative costs but
 
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
yes if the appropriation is goes through
 
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:44.339 align:start position:0%
I think that puts us in a position when
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
we redo the contract to be able to offer
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
a better rate and maybe attract more
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
people to that thanks
 
01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
I think without it the contract system
 
01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:55.259 align:start position:0%
is going to just continue to sort of
 
01:08:57.289 --> 01:08:57.299 align:start position:0%
Wither on the vine but we have not
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
specifically put money in the budget to
 
01:09:00.289 --> 01:09:00.299 align:start position:0%
cover that okay
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
which means you've got to give us what
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
we've asked for
 
01:09:06.769 --> 01:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
well some of us are still afraid of you
 
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
so you're upgraded me I'm just glad all
 
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.030 align:start position:0%
so you're upgraded me I'm just glad all
everywhere

01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
thank you both appreciate your uh
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
attention to our needs so thanks bench
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
again we won't make a decision on this
 
01:09:27.769 --> 01:09:27.779 align:start position:0%

due to inflation and the lack of

there were only 498 group 2 firefighters
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
receiving the stipend last year we were
 
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
told that uh by this committee that it
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't a budget year and to come back
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
this year and a cola could be
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
implemented in the budget social
 
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
security has given its members an 8.7
 
01:14:49.010 --> 01:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
percent increase this year unfortunately
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
group two police and firefighters don't
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
receive Social Security under the
 
01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
windfall Act of 1984 if a group two
 
01:14:57.530 --> 01:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
member were to be eligible for Social
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
Security their benefits would be reduced
 
01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
by 40 at minimum and as much as 90
 
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:04.520 align:start position:0%

01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:06.780 align:start position:0%
predominantly New Hampshire retirement
 
01:15:09.649 --> 01:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
system is what group two members rely on
 
01:15:12.050 --> 01:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
for their retirement income very simple
 
01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
math will show that the matter of time
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
without color adjustments pensions will
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
be forced on some kind of Social
 
01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
Services because their pensions will be
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
devoured by inflation
 
01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
the average pension of group 2 police
 
01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:26.820 align:start position:0%

respectively
 
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
there's a report developed by nasra on
 
01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
the cost of the living adjustments that
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
show how inflation impacts the

inflation Factor the natural brief also
 
01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
shows that New Hampshire is an anomaly
 
01:16:01.729 --> 01:16:01.739 align:start position:0%

legislature has arbitrarily taken funds
 
01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
away from the retired workers that would
 
01:16:35.209 --> 01:16:35.219 align:start position:0%
have been paid paying for colas and
 
01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
Health Care subsidies by changing dates
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
and when excessive earnings were
 
01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
reported and the elimination of the
 
01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
special accounts some 637 million
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
dollars dedicated to retirees was
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
diverted for no justifiable reason other
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
than to lower the employer's
 
01:16:52.850 --> 01:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
contributions on the backs of the
 
01:16:55.729 --> 01:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
retirees granting a reasonable colon for
 
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
group two retirees will greatly reduce
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
the impact inflation has incurred on
 
01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
them over the last two decades I ask
 
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
that you please support your retired
 
01:17:06.169 --> 01:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
Public Safety workers and vote in favor
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 571 and those desperately
 
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
needed cost of living adjustments and I
 
01:17:14.209 --> 01:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
will answer any questions
 
01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:16.440 align:start position:0%
could you also provide a copy of your
 
01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
testimony to our LBA folks you can have
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.649 --> 01:17:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
well seeing none uh just to let you know
 
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
where we stand we are still waiting for
 
01:17:34.729 --> 01:17:34.739 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates I believe you're
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh the bill that you're supporting is
 
01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:39.659 align:start position:0%
about an 84 million dollar impact on our
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
general funds which is pretty
 
01:17:43.130 --> 01:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
substantial as you can well imagine
 
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
right so we haven't made any decisions
 
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
and we probably won't until we get the
 
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates
 
01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:52.910 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates
um

01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
I think that's it we'll get a copy of
 
01:17:57.649 --> 01:17:57.659 align:start position:0%
your testimony and Marty do you have
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
anything to add back there if you had
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
any questions for me but I don't have
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
anything else to pretend okay I just
 
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
can't stress enough that group two
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
um has not received adequate colas over
 
01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years and we don't receive
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
Social Security
 
01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:15.659 align:start position:0%
um so that those are the two big factors
 
01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
that I hope you look at when when you're
 
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill
 
01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:22.140 align:start position:0%
so maybe you said it in your testimony
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
what's the average uh pension that group
 
01:18:28.130 --> 01:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
two members are getting now it's 38 000
 
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
something for police and forty two
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
thousand something for fire okay it's
 
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
pretty close I think Social Security the
 
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
max is about 43 000 a year so it's in
 
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
that same okay that's why last year's uh
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
stipend didn't affect group two because
 
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
you based it on people that made less
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
than thirty thousand right and it didn't
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
didn't affect us on I think two percent
 
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
of all that money went to group two all
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
the rest was that went to group one
 
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh representative Griffin has a question
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
do they say no you don't good question
 
01:19:05.689 --> 01:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
for Marty yeah Marty thank you very much
 
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
Marty if you don't mind coming forward
 
01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.530 align:start position:0%
Marty if you don't mind coming forward
and

01:19:12.530 --> 01:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.149 align:start position:0%
 
always

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
always
 
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire as a question for you
 
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
um pensions have upper limits
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
um some for some people it's different
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
for different people but it's either 85
 
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
percent or 100 percent of their final
 
01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:31.970 align:start position:0%
percent or 100 percent of their final
salary

01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
salary
 
01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
um so my question is
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
is is uh House Bill 571
 
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.110 align:start position:0%
is is uh House Bill 571
um

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
do does the upper limit count or or is
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
this a extra beyond the up those upper
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
limits in some cases the
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
um objective for the record uh Marty
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
Carlin from nhrs
 
01:19:57.649 --> 01:19:57.659 align:start position:0%
um the the bill affects
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
um folks who are retired either 10 uh 10
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
to 19 years ago or more than 20 years
 
01:20:05.810 --> 01:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
ago the the maximum benefit limit in the
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
statute uh was enacted in 09 for anyone
 
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
who commends service after 09 so this
 
01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
Cola does those maximum limits wouldn't
 
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
apply to any of these retirees because
 
01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
because they start because of their
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
entry date in the system
 
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
um that said it is a five or ten percent
 
01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
Cola on the first 50 000 of their
 
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
benefits so if their benefit is in
 
01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
excess of that it wouldn't you know
 
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
there's a maximum amount of what the
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
what the cola would be because it's on
 
01:20:36.250 --> 01:20:36.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
I representative Weiler
 
01:20:41.630 --> 01:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr Carlin my
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
recollection over three decades has been
 
01:20:46.850 --> 01:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
that cost of living adjustments have
 
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
been few and far between I don't think
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's on anybody could call it a regular
 
01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.430 align:start position:0%
it's on anybody could call it a regular
thing

01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
I think there was only in the 90s when
 
01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
we had a pretty good Surplus that I
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
remember them being fairly consistent
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
but I don't think they have been prior
 
01:21:04.870 --> 01:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
to that or even since is that likely
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
there I think it had been through the
 
01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
2000s they were a fairly fairly
 
01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
consistent they were um whatever the
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
number ended up being I think fiscal
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
committee was the one who said it and it
 
01:21:18.410 --> 01:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
was based on how much funding was in the
 
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
special account which Mr Beaudry
 
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
referred to him which was repealed
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
um back in 2011 or 12. um I don't have
 
01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
it with me but I will send
 
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
um the LBA folks to share I I look on
 
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
our website we have a history of coal is
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
going back to the late 90s so you can
 
01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
just just for reference
 
01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:38.940 align:start position:0%
um you know but you know and but he's
 
01:21:40.490 --> 01:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct in saying that the
 
01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
last prior to 2010 which was sort of a
 
01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
legacy from a 2008 Bill the only Cola
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
was not enacted in 19 and took effect in
 
01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.330 align:start position:0%
was not enacted in 19 and took effect in
20.

01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
yeah before then I I doesn't go back as
 
01:21:58.729 --> 01:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
far but I I do looking at sort of the
 
01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
you know the ledges the bound volumes of
 
01:22:02.030 --> 01:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
the legislation over years it seems like
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
it was very ad hoc back in the 70s and
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
80s as well like the the special account
 
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
was as you know
 
01:22:12.110 --> 01:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
it it'll effects that it had that was
 
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:14.940 align:start position:0%
that was a way to try to set up a fund
 
01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you
 
01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
um have group one employees ever had
 
01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:27.590 align:start position:0%
um have group one employees ever had
colas

01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
colas
 
01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
the the last oh so and to my historical
 
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
record which you know predates when I
 
01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
started but goes back to the 90s when
 
01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
colors were granted every group got them
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
sometimes the percentages were different
 
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
among the groups a lot of most years
 
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
they were the same the 2019 Cola bill
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
um I think I forget the bill number but
 
01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
that was the one and a half for all
 
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
all right so when you make a historical
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
chart maybe have a group one yeah
 
01:23:00.110 --> 01:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
back at the office that I should have
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
brought has them broken down in columns
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that would be
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
helpful Marty thanks uh representative
 
01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:08.540 align:start position:0%
uh Weiler
 
01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:14.410 --> 01:23:14.420 align:start position:0%
who knows why
 
01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
remembering when we were doing these uh
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
cost of living adjustments
 
01:23:21.169 --> 01:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
one of the things we looked at was how
 
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
much Surplus there was now when person
 
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
is hired they contribute to the
 
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
retirement and so does the employer if
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
the person leaves before they're vested
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
they get to take what they put in but
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
the money the employer put in stays
 
01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:38.630 align:start position:0%
the money the employer put in stays
there

01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:40.980 align:start position:0%
so if you have a lot of turnover I.E
 
01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
teachers there's more money in that fund
 
01:23:46.250 --> 01:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
there's less turnover in the firemen
 
01:23:49.010 --> 01:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
than any any other group the police had
 
01:23:50.689 --> 01:23:50.699 align:start position:0%
had a higher turnover than the firemen
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
and the teachers and the employees
 
01:23:55.310 --> 01:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
certainly had a higher so when we looked
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
at the amounts of money
 
01:23:59.930 --> 01:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
where we could give a cost of living
 
01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
and one of my colleagues who was a
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
fireman was saying
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
those people hate the firemen
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
and it was all because there was less
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
Surplus in the Fireman's Fund because
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
not only were there fewer firemen but
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
there were fewer who left money in the
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
fund most of them stayed there the 20
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
years thank you for the Loyalty but as
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
far as there was far more turnover in
 
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
the other groups which left more money
 
01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
so sometimes it ended up with the
 
01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
teachers getting twice as much as the
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
firemen just due to the fact there was
 
01:24:37.130 --> 01:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
more money in the fund so it didn't have
 
01:24:39.169 --> 01:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
anything to do with with the Prejudice
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately the Loyalty of the
 
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
firemen costs them that that cost of
 
01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
living adjustment so that was something
 
01:24:48.169 --> 01:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
that we regretted but that was the money
 
01:24:52.490 --> 01:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.649 --> 01:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
I'm just going through the testimony I
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
thought I could find it I thought it was
 
01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
said but when is the last time group two
 
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
received any sort of cola they were all
 
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
group two in group one all were in the I
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
think it was hb616 it was enacted in
 
01:25:12.169 --> 01:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
2019 and took took effect in fiscal 20.
 
01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
um that was the 500 no no that was oh
 
01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:16.130 align:start position:0%
um that was the 500 no no that was oh
the

01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
um the the cola was in 2019 begin taking
 
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
effect in 20 there was a 500 temporary
 
01:25:25.490 --> 01:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
supplement allowance a one-time payment
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
this past year it's a voter referred to
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
and because the the recipients were
 
01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:33.719 align:start position:0%
capped at thirty thousand dollars or
 
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
less annually fewer firefighters there's
 
01:25:38.209 --> 01:25:38.219 align:start position:0%
a percentage of that group received the
 
01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
500 then you know other groups because
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
their formulas generate larger benefits
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
because of the Social Security
 
01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
them not being in Social Security
 
01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:50.870 align:start position:0%
them not being in Social Security
okay

01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thanks Marty
 
01:25:57.709 --> 01:25:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.110 --> 01:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh the division have any thoughts on
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:26:01.679 --> 01:26:06.890 align:start position:0%
this uh
information

01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
we'll hold on to it then yeah I think
 
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
um I didn't know if you were thinking of
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
amendment uh Professor McGuire well yeah
 
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
I mean so certainly I would think this
 
01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
bill should be retained and if we're
 
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
going to do anything in this area it
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
would go into the budget
 
01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.129 align:start position:0%
would go into the budget
um

01:26:25.129 --> 01:26:25.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:28.729 --> 01:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
now in specifically I put the word taper
 
01:26:31.070 --> 01:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
here one of my least favorite parts of
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
that it's it's got two chunks in it
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
right so so somebody who retired one day
 
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
could get half the benefit of somebody
 
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
who retired the day previously right so
 
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
that that to me is unattractive and so
 
01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
one thing we could do is make it
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
year by year by year or something like
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
that as a as a more of a ramp rather
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
than as a as two steps
 
01:27:03.649 --> 01:27:03.659 align:start position:0%
um the other thing according to Carol is
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
that frequently cola's this bill is a
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
cola that is permanent for the rest of
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
the person's life whereas frequently
 
01:27:17.209 --> 01:27:17.219 align:start position:0%
colas are given more as for the next two
 
01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
years a certain amount and that would
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
make a big difference in the in the cost
 
01:27:23.810 --> 01:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
so when you mention classes you have the
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
taper the one time or itl so what do you
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
what's your lead out of those three
 
01:27:36.649 --> 01:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
I think we can't make that decision
 
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
until we know how much money we have to
 
01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
spend and
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
put it in the pile with all the other
 
01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
things all right we agree I was told
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday we might know something today
 
01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:54.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:57.530 --> 01:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
good idea that's going to depend on
 
01:27:59.570 --> 01:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
everything we do today thanks so much
 
01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
thanks Mike
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
so we'll take a three minute break I
 
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
mean some of the smaller bills we can
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe oh no problem
 
01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:03.770 --> 01:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
all right we'll uh open the work session
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 74.
 
01:32:10.129 --> 01:32:10.139 align:start position:0%
and this is relative to an employee's
 
01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
unused earned time I do see
 
01:32:15.050 --> 01:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill here like to give
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
be careful you know we might get one so
 
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
it's not a public hearing it's at work
 
01:32:31.370 --> 01:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh good morning I as Mr Lee Smith
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
alluded to I am representative Michael
 
01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
Cahill from uh Newmarket I represent the
 
01:32:41.209 --> 01:32:41.219 align:start position:0%
town the new market and new fields in
 
01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 10. and I'm pleased that
 
01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
you're here working on this bill we we
 
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
did a good job with it in the house last
 
01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:48.890 align:start position:0%
did a good job with it in the house last
week

01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
and uh let me tell you a little bit
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
about uh I don't I don't see Mr
 
01:32:55.610 --> 01:32:55.620 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus here but he testified in
 
01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
labor that the fiscal impacts despite
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
the rather horrendous four and a half
 
01:33:04.610 --> 01:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
million in the fiscal note uh as far as
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
the state's concerned it would be his
 
01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
word de Minimus
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
and that's because people aren't likely
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
to leave on Mass
 
01:33:16.669 --> 01:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
uh and and or take you know large
 
01:33:20.330 --> 01:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
amounts of accrued time with them so as
 
01:33:22.610 --> 01:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
far as the state's concerned no no real
 
01:33:25.209 --> 01:33:25.219 align:start position:0%
no real impact I think in the
 
01:33:25.219 --> 01:33:26.770 align:start position:0%
no real impact I think in the
municipalities

01:33:26.770 --> 01:33:26.780 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
uh though I am not now nor have I ever
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
been a member of a union I think many
 
01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
many in those areas are members of
 
01:33:37.729 --> 01:33:37.739 align:start position:0%
unions and I assume that the current CBA
 
01:33:40.250 --> 01:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
would hold
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
for the life of that agreement
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
and and going further going forward that
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
this issue would not need to be
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
negotiated because
 
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
everyone would be able to take their
 
01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
unused vacation time with them
 
01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
under you know at least if they were
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
left in good standing I don't or laid
 
01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.410 align:start position:0%
left in good standing I don't or laid
off

01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think we're selling towns just
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
yet so we wouldn't be the business is
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
sold as another another consideration
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
for when the when the person uh takes
 
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
their uh vacation time with them and
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
also uh this only applies to uh
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
businesses entities with 15 or more
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
employees and I suppose there could be
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
some unincorporated areas small towns
 
01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
that really just have two or three
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
people they would be they wouldn't be
 
01:34:30.830 --> 01:34:30.840 align:start position:0%
subject to this although I have to I
 
01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
have to say that I think this is
 
01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
actually the right thing to do that that
 
01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
you earn your vacation time it's like
 
01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
wages and so that when you leave you
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
know uh you should be you should receive
 
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.440 align:start position:0%
those wages in your final paycheck
 
01:34:47.570 --> 01:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
provided that you're not being fired for
 
01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
cause or or
 
01:34:52.669 --> 01:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
that's that's basically it other states
 
01:34:54.530 --> 01:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
I know we're not other states but other
 
01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
states have laws protecting the employer
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
the employee regardless of the
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances of their departure but
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
that's not what this does
 
01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:05.930 align:start position:0%
that's not what this does
and

01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
so again I think there's nothing in here
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
about uh prohibiting an employer from uh
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
having a user to lose it uh during you
 
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
know for the for the calendar year you
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
have this much time if you don't use it
 
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
within that period it's gone they could
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
they could still do that which would
 
01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
discourage people from accumulating a
 
01:35:31.129 --> 01:35:31.139 align:start position:0%
great mass of time and then retiring and
 
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
well now you all meet you know three
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a month you know we
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
don't want that so that that's not
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
that's not any part of this bill it
 
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
really just uh says that if you are
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
employed uh if there are 15 or more
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
employees and the and the employer
 
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
offers paid leave and not everyone does
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh then it would be yours in the you
 
01:35:56.990 --> 01:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
know if upon termination provided that
 
01:36:00.169 --> 01:36:00.179 align:start position:0%
you leave on good terms or in the event
 
01:36:02.689 --> 01:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
that the uh you're laid off
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
which of course you don't get advance
 
01:36:07.930 --> 01:36:07.940 align:start position:0%
notice of that and um and the business
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
is is sold which one might expect as I
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
as I said last week that when you when
 
01:36:16.490 --> 01:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
the business is sold you either receive
 
01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
your vacation pay or the the amount is
 
01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
transferred to the next to the new owner
 
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
which is the decent thing to do but
 
01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
that's not the current lot that you
 
01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
don't have to do that you may do it but
 
01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
I really think we should be meeting
 
01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
people's reasonable expectations and
 
01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:35.460 align:start position:0%
passing this law
 
01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:52.610 align:start position:0%
passing this law
foreign

01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
committee report on both sides so I see
 
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
there's concern and support so obviously
 
01:37:00.649 --> 01:37:00.659 align:start position:0%
that's why there was a 10-10 vote
 
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
now I as you know the finance committee
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
we try to stay focused to the fiscal
 
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
impact but I'm looking at the fiscal
 
01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:08.629 align:start position:0%
impact but I'm looking at the fiscal
note

01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
note
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
and it's showing
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
up to perhaps a 4.5 million
 
01:37:19.129 --> 01:37:19.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
yes uh as I as I said that was from from
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
the uh Department of administrative
 
01:37:28.669 --> 01:37:28.679 align:start position:0%
Services Mr arlinghaus said that uh in
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
truth it is the impact would be de
 
01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:32.149 align:start position:0%
truth it is the impact would be de
minimis

01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
minimis
 
01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:34.860 align:start position:0%
representative Wiley has a question
 
01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
not clear reading the bill
 
01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
so this is applying to private
 
01:37:42.290 --> 01:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
contractors and maybe even cities towns
 
01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
and counties
 
01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
yes all the above so it could be a 28a
 
01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:48.290 align:start position:0%
yes all the above so it could be a 28a
issue

01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:37:50.750 --> 01:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
to some degree it's small but it could
 
01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
be a 28 day issue very very very modest
 
01:37:57.110 --> 01:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
I I think I I would think we are that we
 
01:37:59.209 --> 01:37:59.219 align:start position:0%
are probably in the in the public sector
 
01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:01.860 align:start position:0%
we're probably doing better in terms of
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
taking good care of people throughout
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
their employee
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
and especially now it's very hard for
 
01:38:11.090 --> 01:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
people to to hire and retain
 
01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
and the last thing you want is a bad
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
reputation out there in the community
 
01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
that well I left and they you know they
 
01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
didn't pay me my two weeks that I had
 
01:38:22.910 --> 01:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
earned and didn't get to use
 
01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
and hopefully follow up with
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
um people coming to locate their
 
01:38:30.770 --> 01:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
businesses in this state this would not
 
01:38:32.689 --> 01:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
be something that would turn them away
 
01:38:34.729 --> 01:38:34.739 align:start position:0%
whereas if we put too many restrictions
 
01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
on on how they treat their employees
 
01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
they might go elsewhere I understand and
 
01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:42.659 align:start position:0%
I and I do believe that this this should
 
01:38:44.090 --> 01:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
not be a deal breaker for someone
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
committing you know considering New
 
01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:48.350 align:start position:0%
committing you know considering New
Hampshire

01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
represent Gambrills thank you Mr chair
 
01:38:53.570 --> 01:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the question
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
um how widespread do you think this is
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
because I know when I worked in uh in
 
01:39:00.770 --> 01:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
the public sector almost all the
 
01:39:03.410 --> 01:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
companies uh reimburse you for vacation
 
01:39:06.290 --> 01:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
whenever you retired left were laid off
 
01:39:08.930 --> 01:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
so how how widespread do you think this
 
01:39:11.689 --> 01:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
is is it an issue uh thank you for the
 
01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
question uh the department of New
 
01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor has said
 
01:39:17.930 --> 01:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
that roughly 20 percent of of wage
 
01:39:21.530 --> 01:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
claims involve vacation pay
 
01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
you know someone someone said someone
 
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't get what they think they
 
01:39:26.090 --> 01:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
have coming to them they go to the
 
01:39:27.709 --> 01:39:27.719 align:start position:0%
department those that you know they have
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
many phone calls and when they when they
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
say to them that well I don't I what's
 
01:39:34.729 --> 01:39:34.739 align:start position:0%
the policy if the policy has this
 
01:39:36.649 --> 01:39:36.659 align:start position:0%
disclaimer that says we don't pay upon
 
01:39:39.290 --> 01:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
termination then that often discourages
 
01:39:41.050 --> 01:39:41.060 align:start position:0%
people from going forward with a hearing
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
uh some still do and they hit that they
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
hit this stone wall they said uh there
 
01:39:49.030 --> 01:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
an assisted living center located in my
 
01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
town and the owner sold the company the
 
01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
people continued on the same employment
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
with the new employer and their vacation
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
day disappeared it was gone because he
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
said the pawn termination wait don't pay
 
01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.149 align:start position:0%
said the pawn termination wait don't pay
vacation

01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
vacation
 
01:40:10.610 --> 01:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
uh there was another incident uh someone
 
01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
I happened to work with in a couple of
 
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
different situations she worked for this
 
01:40:17.570 --> 01:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
company as a shipper for seven years she
 
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
had a couple of weeks of vacation pay
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
they called her in Friday and today is
 
01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
your last day and she did go to the
 
01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
department but and they the employer
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
responded and explained that well we we
 
01:40:31.850 --> 01:40:31.860 align:start position:0%
didn't give her her vacation hours
 
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
because our company policy requires that
 
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
you request the time three weeks in
 
01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:38.450 align:start position:0%
you request the time three weeks in
advance

01:40:38.450 --> 01:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
advance
 
01:40:41.149 --> 01:40:41.159 align:start position:0%
and being laid off with no notice left
 
01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
her no opportunity to request it through
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
extend that so it does happen and as the
 
01:40:48.169 --> 01:40:48.179 align:start position:0%
department said twenty percent of the
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
time twenty percent of their complaints
 
01:40:52.070 --> 01:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
involved this at least is one of the
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
factors so I think it's something we
 
01:40:55.970 --> 01:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
need to address
 
01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
further question
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so 20 do you have the
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
number of so what is 20 of what
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh I I'm sorry I I don't have that with
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
me I will get it to you but I do have I
 
01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
did have some documents from previous
 
01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
iterations of the bill how many claims
 
01:41:15.649 --> 01:41:15.659 align:start position:0%
there were this year in that year and
 
01:41:17.149 --> 01:41:17.159 align:start position:0%
how many involved that but I will get
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
kind of a follow-up to representative
 
01:41:24.410 --> 01:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
Weiler's questions
 
01:41:26.750 --> 01:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
what if the what was the position of the
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor on this proposed
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
legislation I I think you know that our
 
01:41:37.850 --> 01:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
state agencies tend to remain neutral at
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
least but some of them but I will tell
 
01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
you that in in my interactions uh with
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
the Department this is something that
 
01:41:49.609 --> 01:41:49.619 align:start position:0%
they believe is should be done it's the
 
01:41:52.129 --> 01:41:52.139 align:start position:0%
right thing to do and I think uh some of
 
01:41:53.689 --> 01:41:53.699 align:start position:0%
their hearing officers are probably
 
01:41:53.699 --> 01:41:54.830 align:start position:0%
their hearing officers are probably
frustrated

01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
frustrated
 
01:41:56.689 --> 01:41:56.699 align:start position:0%
with some of these hearings that they
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
can't rule on behalf of the person who
 
01:42:02.330 --> 01:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
was obviously shortchanged
 
01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire thank you Mr chairman
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
um did it come up in you I'm trying to
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
think of how this could possibly relate
 
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
to the budget right so did it come up as
 
01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:16.010 align:start position:0%
to the budget right so did it come up as
to

01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
we have certain what we call
 
01:42:17.820 --> 01:42:20.209 align:start position:0%
we have certain what we call
anti-spiking

01:42:20.209 --> 01:42:20.219 align:start position:0%
anti-spiking
 
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
um things in our laws that prevent
 
01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:25.629 align:start position:0%
um things in our laws that prevent
um

01:42:25.629 --> 01:42:25.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
vacation pay and other special pay at
 
01:42:31.850 --> 01:42:31.860 align:start position:0%
the end of one's service from Counting
 
01:42:36.890 --> 01:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
as extra income for the last year so for
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
the purpose of boosting a retirement
 
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
payment would this bill make any changes
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
in that area or affected at all no oh
 
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Mr Maguire no
 
01:42:48.609 --> 01:42:48.619 align:start position:0%
I no I don't believe it would
 
01:42:51.229 --> 01:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
inasmuch as there is nothing to prevent
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
the employer from limiting you know
 
01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
saying if you don't use it by this time
 
01:42:56.770 --> 01:42:56.780 align:start position:0%
you lose it
 
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh and I I I don't see this as a as a
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
spiking enabling bill
 
01:43:07.129 --> 01:43:07.139 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't mean
 
01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
um for private employers I meant for
 
01:43:11.570 --> 01:43:11.580 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
would it would we have to change
 
01:43:15.970 --> 01:43:15.980 align:start position:0%
something else somewhere
 
01:43:18.890 --> 01:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
dealing with state employees as a result
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
of this do you see what I mean I don't
 
01:43:22.490 --> 01:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
believe so I'll give it not to my
 
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
knowledge yeah
 
01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
um all right thank you yeah represent
 
01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
evil thank you thank you for being here
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
do you know if New Hampshire is unusual
 
01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
and not having a provision that requires
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
unearned time to be paid I would say
 
01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:42.659 align:start position:0%
we're we are not unusual we're not in
 
01:43:46.970 --> 01:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
the minority the things do vary but uh I
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
believe right now there are probably
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
only seven or eight states that address
 
01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
this and some to a harsher degree than
 
01:43:56.570 --> 01:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
others like I said in Massachusetts and
 
01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
in Maine recently doesn't matter you
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
could punch the boss in the nose and
 
01:44:02.810 --> 01:44:02.820 align:start position:0%
they still have to pay you the vacation
 
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
pay so we're not trying to do that here
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so you don't need to
 
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
get a face guard or anything and go back
 
01:44:12.290 --> 01:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.209 --> 01:44:20.219 align:start position:0%
or then uh I've had numerous
 
01:44:23.209 --> 01:44:23.219 align:start position:0%
conversations with Mr Juve
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
and interestingly you know he he has a
 
01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:28.739 align:start position:0%
concern that you know if any time you
 
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
tell a business how to run their
 
01:44:33.649 --> 01:44:33.659 align:start position:0%
business that that gets his dander up
 
01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
yet this the examples I cited he agreed
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
those were in his word egregious and
 
01:44:41.209 --> 01:44:41.219 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be allowed to happen
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
so somehow we have to find a way to stop
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
those from happening while not taking
 
01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
away everything that a business you know
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
can do or design with its benefits I I
 
01:44:55.490 --> 01:44:55.500 align:start position:0%
think this bill does that we're not
 
01:44:58.669 --> 01:44:58.679 align:start position:0%
requiring employers to offer paid time
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
off we are
 
01:45:03.890 --> 01:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
using the the number 15 as a threshold
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
which I guess is used in other
 
01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:07.189 align:start position:0%
which I guess is used in other
situations

01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
situations
 
01:45:09.890 --> 01:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
and and it's uh
 
01:45:12.649 --> 01:45:12.659 align:start position:0%
it doesn't touch the annual user lose it
 
01:45:14.689 --> 01:45:14.699 align:start position:0%
it only refers to what happens
 
01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
when Trump when employment ends and
 
01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:20.699 align:start position:0%
under really either two circumstances
 
01:45:22.209 --> 01:45:22.219 align:start position:0%
that are beyond the employee's control
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
and the other one leaving in good
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
standing is really to the benefit of
 
01:45:28.970 --> 01:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
both the employer and the employee
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
and I and again I think uh people aren't
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
leaving in droves so I I think the
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
impact the fiscal impacts even for a
 
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
business would be small and basically
 
01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do
 
01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:46.129 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do
yeah

01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.139 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
so is this a topic that's covered in
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
Union contracts
 
01:45:54.169 --> 01:45:54.179 align:start position:0%
I I I think it may be and and again I
 
01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
assume that any current
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
contract would remain in force and that
 
01:46:02.030 --> 01:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
in the future that this topic might not
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative hatch has a question for
 
01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:08.990 align:start position:0%
representative hatch has a question for
you

01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.750 align:start position:0%
you
um

01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:14.990 --> 01:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
all full-time employees uh get paid time
 
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.189 align:start position:0%
all full-time employees uh get paid time
off

01:46:16.189 --> 01:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
um at one time I was a full-time
 
01:46:20.510 --> 01:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
employee but I worked on a straight
 
01:46:23.050 --> 01:46:23.060 align:start position:0%
commission basis
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
and I dictated my hours I dictated where
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
and when I went
 
01:46:30.350 --> 01:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
um and dictated
 
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
how I went about doing my business you
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
might have been a 1099
 
01:46:39.010 --> 01:46:39.020 align:start position:0%
no no but the prerequisite they dictated
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
whom I had as a client so that was the
 
01:46:46.910 --> 01:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
thing that changed that so how is this
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
handled for those individuals same way
 
01:46:49.679 --> 01:46:50.990 align:start position:0%
handled for those individuals same way
or

01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
um because I I had a contract and and I
 
01:46:56.330 --> 01:46:56.340 align:start position:0%
really didn't have any vacation time but
 
01:46:58.850 --> 01:46:58.860 align:start position:0%
that was my choice and like another goal
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
as I chose so to speak so word is that
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
tie in that's one question
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
I can't wait for the next one thank you
 
01:47:08.890 --> 01:47:08.900 align:start position:0%
Mr Heads uh
 
01:47:12.350 --> 01:47:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh boy uh as it's been pointed out it is
 
01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
difficult to cover every possible
 
01:47:17.149 --> 01:47:17.159 align:start position:0%
scenario in which people work I think
 
01:47:19.010 --> 01:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
that since you had agreed not to have
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
vacation then they wouldn't owe you
 
01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:22.550 align:start position:0%
vacation then they wouldn't owe you
anything

01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
if a similar person working under the
 
01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
same terms
 
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh that said if you if your time was
 
01:47:31.930 --> 01:47:31.940 align:start position:0%
your own to use as your own
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's certainly uh that's something
 
01:47:37.010 --> 01:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
that you agreed to and I don't think
 
01:47:39.890 --> 01:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
this would be prohibited it provided the
 
01:47:43.729 --> 01:47:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
01:47:47.689 --> 01:47:47.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
the question I'm interested to go back
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
to that case that was brought to the
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
labor department you said that
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
the company's position was that
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
she had the employee had to give three
 
01:48:05.570 --> 01:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
weeks notice yet she was terminated so
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
she didn't have the ability so how did
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
the label Department find on that
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
particular case
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh in that particular case when the when
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
the claimant the employee received the
 
01:48:19.550 --> 01:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
response from the employer I she I think
 
01:48:22.250 --> 01:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
she just gave up because that's the
 
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
policy said no you don't get it and that
 
01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
was the end of it and that's one of the
 
01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's this is how I got interested in
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
this issue I ran into her in the
 
01:48:33.890 --> 01:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
supermarket as you know we often do with
 
01:48:36.649 --> 01:48:36.659 align:start position:0%
people and and she told me about it and
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
you know it was later that they learned
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
about the incident and with the Assisted
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
Living place so this is just one of
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
those things that we shouldn't allow
 
01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
people to do
 
01:48:50.450 --> 01:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
as as of as a follow-up um
 
01:48:53.209 --> 01:48:53.219 align:start position:0%
it really concerns me that this this
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
Bill gets involved in that in the
 
01:48:58.609 --> 01:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
business of the business so people have
 
01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
to do a certain amount of accounting and
 
01:49:04.729 --> 01:49:04.739 align:start position:0%
this and that and I'm not sure that the
 
01:49:07.930 --> 01:49:07.940 align:start position:0%
abuses that may exist
 
01:49:10.370 --> 01:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
warrant that all
 
01:49:13.370 --> 01:49:13.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm just concerned it's more
 
01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:14.810 align:start position:0%
and I'm just concerned it's more
bureaucracy

01:49:14.810 --> 01:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy
 
01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:17.060 align:start position:0%
it's more work for
 
01:49:20.209 --> 01:49:20.219 align:start position:0%
particularly 15 employees is not a big
 
01:49:20.219 --> 01:49:22.030 align:start position:0%
particularly 15 employees is not a big
company

01:49:22.030 --> 01:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
company
 
01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
they might only have one person that
 
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
takes care of the office and it's just
 
01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
another level of of more work and I'm
 
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
not sure it's justified by the abuses
 
01:49:35.810 --> 01:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
that exist
 
01:49:39.709 --> 01:49:39.719 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Griffin I I think uh as as I
 
01:49:42.109 --> 01:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
recall the uh
 
01:49:45.490 --> 01:49:45.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Juve of the Bia felt that the
 
01:49:47.930 --> 01:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
record-keeping was really just good
 
01:49:49.850 --> 01:49:49.860 align:start position:0%
business practice
 
01:49:52.850 --> 01:49:52.860 align:start position:0%
and I would say that if uh if it was you
 
01:49:55.250 --> 01:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
or someone that you knew who was on the
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
receiving end or they started
 
01:49:58.729 --> 01:49:58.739 align:start position:0%
non-receiving end of this you might view
 
01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
that that issue differently
 
01:50:03.590 --> 01:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh that is to say that you know 20 like
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
I remember someone in the previous
 
01:50:07.669 --> 01:50:07.679 align:start position:0%
hearing saying well 20 that's not much
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
20 is a lot 20 is a 20 pay raise 20 tax
 
01:50:12.119 --> 01:50:13.129 align:start position:0%
20 is a lot 20 is a 20 pay raise 20 tax
increase

01:50:13.129 --> 01:50:13.139 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:50:15.530 --> 01:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
20 you know it's still a lot of people
 
01:50:19.010 --> 01:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
and I think one person uh whether it was
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh someone close to you or that person
 
01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
in the office that handles that the
 
01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:25.070 align:start position:0%
in the office that handles that the
accounting

01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
01:50:27.649 --> 01:50:27.659 align:start position:0%
it matters
 
01:50:30.770 --> 01:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
so this is earned you earn it it's
 
01:50:33.050 --> 01:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
whether it's accrued or it's or if it's
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
you get so much a year you could prorate
 
01:50:38.030 --> 01:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
that it's a matter of the understanding
 
01:50:39.649 --> 01:50:39.659 align:start position:0%
is that's mine I'm earning and it's part
 
01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
of the work I'm doing for the company
 
01:50:45.410 --> 01:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
it's only fair that it is mine on the
 
01:50:47.229 --> 01:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
event of the
 
01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
departure that the termination of the
 
01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:50.330 align:start position:0%
departure that the termination of the
deployment

01:50:50.330 --> 01:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
deployment
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know I don't want to get in a debate
 
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
with you I'm happy you're here to defend
 
01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:03.780 align:start position:0%
the bill and give us answers so but it
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
remember we're not talking about 20
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
percent of the population we're talking
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
about 20 percent of the people who file
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
with the labor board and I have no idea
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
how those cases came out maybe 19
 
01:51:19.550 --> 01:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
percent of them won
 
01:51:22.970 --> 01:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry it was certainly not 19
 
01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
it's a rarity it's a rarity that that
 
01:51:28.189 --> 01:51:28.199 align:start position:0%
people Prevail either because they
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
misunderstood or misread didn't follow
 
01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
the policy or because of this disclaimer
 
01:51:37.970 --> 01:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
that trumps all reason and and justice
 
01:51:40.250 --> 01:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
and I will get you information about how
 
01:51:42.530 --> 01:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
many and how many people how many claims
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
I will get that to the committee
 
01:51:47.689 --> 01:51:47.699 align:start position:0%
any yes represent Kim brawls thank you
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
um again I haven't been in the industry
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
for a long time in industry for a long
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
time I would argue that it's far worse
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
to have a use it or lose it policy
 
01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
because it forces the employee to take
 
01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
the time and then they lose it at the
 
01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
end of the year if they don't take it
 
01:52:06.649 --> 01:52:06.659 align:start position:0%
whereas I know many companies or most
 
01:52:09.709 --> 01:52:09.719 align:start position:0%
companies allow you to accrue it and
 
01:52:11.570 --> 01:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
then they certainly do pay you when you
 
01:52:13.370 --> 01:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
retire or when you leave they do pay off
 
01:52:18.649 --> 01:52:18.659 align:start position:0%
the vacation so again for if if I were I
 
01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
would have gone further with this bill
 
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
if you really wanted to protect the
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
people I would have try to eliminate the
 
01:52:25.609 --> 01:52:25.619 align:start position:0%
policy of use it or lose it because
 
01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's where most of the hours are lost
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'll guarantee you that
 
01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:31.189 align:start position:0%
I'll guarantee you that
uh

01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
interesting you should mention that
 
01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
because my co-sponsor Mr renzullo we
 
01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
began this on two separate bills he was
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
he was opposed to user to lose it and I
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
was working on the vacation time and we
 
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
tried this the first time separate and
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
then we co-sponsored each other's bills
 
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
and then we pulled our resources and I
 
01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
as I recall I even had one other
 
01:52:54.169 --> 01:52:54.179 align:start position:0%
previous time that we made it through
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
the house and to the Senate we had a
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
provision that in the event that the
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
employer denied the vacation request and
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
you couldn't use it you get 90 days to
 
01:53:08.689 --> 01:53:08.699 align:start position:0%
work that out or be paid again the
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
people on the other side of the hall
 
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't support that but it is a
 
01:53:15.850 --> 01:53:15.860 align:start position:0%
it is a worthy topic for future
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
consideration and I mean I know that in
 
01:53:21.709 --> 01:53:21.719 align:start position:0%
the case of the vacation uh the the
 
01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:23.820 align:start position:0%
department does not track the calls that
 
01:53:25.490 --> 01:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
they get but there are quite a few this
 
01:53:27.590 --> 01:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
is they described it as being a heavy
 
01:53:29.410 --> 01:53:29.420 align:start position:0%
hitting issue
 
01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
and those who go through the claim uh
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
very rarely prevail
 
01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
it does happen I've seen a few it has to
 
01:53:42.169 --> 01:53:42.179 align:start position:0%
be you know that the policy wasn't exist
 
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
or it was silent or it was practiced
 
01:53:46.609 --> 01:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
differently for different people but it
 
01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
is it is an issue and certainly I would
 
01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
I would certainly take a look at the
 
01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
user to lose it part in a subsequent
 
01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:57.830 align:start position:0%
user to lose it part in a subsequent
year

01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:59.930 --> 01:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you and again the numbers it would
 
01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
be interesting to know the total numbers
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
so we could do a better assessment I
 
01:54:05.169 --> 01:54:05.179 align:start position:0%
think I'll do that thank you
 
01:54:07.370 --> 01:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes um I have RSA 275 43 in front of me
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh as As a matter of law there isn't any
 
01:54:18.010 --> 01:54:18.020 align:start position:0%
law that affects people in New Hampshire
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
that requires uh unpaid or unpaid leave
 
01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
time and so forth but the way the law is
 
01:54:27.649 --> 01:54:27.659 align:start position:0%
written it certainly is open to the
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
negotiation and to Union contracts and I
 
01:54:32.689 --> 01:54:32.699 align:start position:0%
suggest that there are some unions I
 
01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
think if you contacted the International
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
Association of firefighters you'd find
 
01:54:38.930 --> 01:54:38.940 align:start position:0%
that there are a large number of fire
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
departments in this country that do have
 
01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
those those Provisions specifically
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
because that's an unusual type of
 
01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
occupation you don't find too many you
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
don't find too many people get into that
 
01:54:54.290 --> 01:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
that field other than working for a
 
01:54:55.609 --> 01:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
government agency
 
01:54:58.430 --> 01:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
and so uh it certainly is something that
 
01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:00.840 align:start position:0%
can be the subject of negotiation and a
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
contract but it isn't something that's
 
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
required by law it doesn't require the
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:15.790 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:19.070 --> 01:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh the law there is no requirement
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
that that an employer offer paid time
 
01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
off vacation Etc
 
01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh and and as far as vacation wages are
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
is when wages are due and as up to the
 
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
employer occurring to determine if
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
vacation wages are part of their policy
 
01:55:39.709 --> 01:55:39.719 align:start position:0%
or not and I think in in most cases the
 
01:55:41.410 --> 01:55:41.420 align:start position:0%
majority of cases as
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Columbus said Campbell said it is
 
01:55:47.290 --> 01:55:47.300 align:start position:0%
sort of generally pop generally
 
01:55:50.330 --> 01:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
expected and done but this is the case
 
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
these are for the cases and there are
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:00.770 --> 01:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
see no further questions uh thank you
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill I think like yeah
 
01:56:06.950 --> 01:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have some discussion yes
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
01:56:12.770 --> 01:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
oh thanks to Mr Hoffman I just got H.R
 
01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
17. which has the estimates which are
 
01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:17.689 align:start position:0%
17. which has the estimates which are
troubling

01:56:17.689 --> 01:56:17.699 align:start position:0%
troubling
 
01:56:20.689 --> 01:56:20.699 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this green sheet from the
 
01:56:23.870 --> 01:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
governor which showed
 
01:56:26.689 --> 01:56:26.699 align:start position:0%
General funds and I believe it doesn't
 
01:56:26.699 --> 01:56:27.890 align:start position:0%
General funds and I believe it doesn't
include

01:56:27.890 --> 01:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:29.229 align:start position:0%
include
the

01:56:29.229 --> 01:56:29.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so it's just the
 
01:56:35.090 --> 01:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
and it shows going from
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
the adjusted authorized
 
01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:41.290 align:start position:0%
the adjusted authorized
2024

01:56:41.290 --> 01:56:41.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.209 --> 01:56:44.219 align:start position:0%
1837 and so on
 
01:56:44.219 --> 01:56:45.830 align:start position:0%
1837 and so on
to

01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:48.290 align:start position:0%
to
25

01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
a 1 billion eight seventy seven so
 
01:56:52.129 --> 01:56:52.139 align:start position:0%
there's only a 40 million dollar
 
01:56:55.070 --> 01:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
increase and then
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
and upload from 2023 to 2020
 
01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:01.129 align:start position:0%
and upload from 2023 to 2020
for

01:57:01.129 --> 01:57:01.139 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:02.820 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
01:57:02.820 --> 01:57:05.450 align:start position:0%
it's about
99

01:57:05.450 --> 01:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
99
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
million yet everybody's coming to us
 
01:57:12.890 --> 01:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
asking for more and the
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
pay raise alone is a hundred million
 
01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:17.390 align:start position:0%
pay raise alone is a hundred million
right

01:57:17.390 --> 01:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:57:20.089 --> 01:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
yeah just shy of 100 million Mike Kane
 
01:57:25.370 --> 01:57:25.380 align:start position:0%
did give me a note that said for 23 the
 
01:57:28.490 --> 01:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
estimates are 42.7 million dollars below
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
the governors
 
01:57:33.790 --> 01:57:33.800 align:start position:0%
and for 24.25 the estimates are
 
01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
88.3 below the governors and that's
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
combined education fund and general fund
 
01:57:45.250 --> 01:57:45.260 align:start position:0%
23 below and then 88 below for FY 23
 
01:57:47.450 --> 01:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
42.7 below
 
01:57:51.370 --> 01:57:51.380 align:start position:0%
and for the 24-25 Diana biennium
 
01:57:53.450 --> 01:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
88.3 below
 
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
this doesn't even cover this pay raise
 
01:57:59.870 --> 01:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
which we're told is not negotiable
 
01:58:02.209 --> 01:58:02.219 align:start position:0%
all it leaves us with is moving money
 
01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
around everywhere else in the budget
 
01:58:07.129 --> 01:58:07.139 align:start position:0%
just to cover the pay raise never mind
 
01:58:10.669 --> 01:58:10.679 align:start position:0%
giving anybody an increase of 10 percent
 
01:58:13.010 --> 01:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
four percent five percent there's no
 
01:58:15.169 --> 01:58:15.179 align:start position:0%
money and the pay raises haven't been
 
01:58:16.729 --> 01:58:16.739 align:start position:0%
factored into any of the budgets in
 
01:58:19.129 --> 01:58:19.139 align:start position:0%
house bill one
 
01:58:21.169 --> 01:58:21.179 align:start position:0%
that's that's likely it I thought they
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
were but
 
01:58:24.350 --> 01:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
no they're not
 
01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:25.609 align:start position:0%
no they're not
so

01:58:25.609 --> 01:58:25.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
it's not in here we don't have it and
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
what what we told Mike that the hb2
 
01:58:40.370 --> 01:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
alone was had
 
01:58:49.609 --> 01:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
yeah if the pay raise is around an hb2
 
01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
is this the total in hb2
 
01:59:22.370 --> 01:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
okay here's my question for house bill
 
01:59:22.380 --> 01:59:23.930 align:start position:0%
okay here's my question for house bill
74.

01:59:23.930 --> 01:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
74.
 
01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
are we allowed to deliberately say no
 
01:59:29.810 --> 01:59:29.820 align:start position:0%
recommendation or can you only have no
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation when it's split we've got
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
to create a balanced budget no no I'm
 
01:59:36.410 --> 01:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
sorry he's talking about seven I'm cut
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm back to representative Cahill's
 
01:59:39.599 --> 01:59:40.970 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm back to representative Cahill's
bill

01:59:40.970 --> 01:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:59:43.209 --> 01:59:43.219 align:start position:0%
I understand we got a serious problem
 
01:59:45.770 --> 01:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
over there but
 
01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:46.629 align:start position:0%
over there but
um

01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:46.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
my question is on House Bill 74 can we
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
send it back to the floor with no
 
01:59:55.370 --> 01:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
recommendation because it's really not
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:01.970 --> 02:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
yeah it you ought to have some
 
02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
dispositive thing like either itl or you
 
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
know and I mean I think everybody would
 
02:00:10.250 --> 02:00:10.260 align:start position:0%
just vote the way they voted right I
 
02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:11.410 align:start position:0%
just vote the way they voted right I
mean

02:00:11.410 --> 02:00:11.420 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:00:13.729 --> 02:00:13.739 align:start position:0%
now we could go back to the full
 
02:00:15.890 --> 02:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
committee with a recommendation and it
 
02:00:17.149 --> 02:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
might be
 
02:00:19.370 --> 02:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
if we vote ought to pass we've got to
 
02:00:21.169 --> 02:00:21.179 align:start position:0%
fit into the budget
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
yeah well even if it's four and a half
 
02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:25.250 align:start position:0%
yeah well even if it's four and a half
million

02:00:25.250 --> 02:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:27.830 align:start position:0%
million
okay

02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:00:29.930 --> 02:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
yeah we will vote we'll vote on
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
everything one way or the other you can
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
vote to retain it in hopes that they'll
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
do something like they did two years ago
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
oh we found another 50 million 100
 
02:00:41.510 --> 02:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
million yeah after we did redid it of
 
02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:42.410 align:start position:0%
million yeah after we did redid it of
course

02:00:42.410 --> 02:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
course
 
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
March and April of big months
 
02:00:48.169 --> 02:00:48.179 align:start position:0%
and Senate gets to look at them we don't
 
02:00:51.649 --> 02:00:51.659 align:start position:0%
so if if they suddenly come up and we've
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
also been reading through the newspaper
 
02:00:55.850 --> 02:00:55.860 align:start position:0%
and so on oh the revenues are coming in
 
02:00:57.649 --> 02:00:57.659 align:start position:0%
well there are 80 million or the 50
 
02:01:00.770 --> 02:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
million above above projected
 
02:01:04.430 --> 02:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
which now we're seeing projections that
 
02:01:06.589 --> 02:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
you know like you said with 23 million
 
02:01:10.850 --> 02:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
behind what the governor says for 2023.
 
02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
and even though we're above plan of
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
we're going down yeah we're actually
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
going down
 
02:01:19.550 --> 02:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
yeah and and some of this Revenue that
 
02:01:21.410 --> 02:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
they come up with looks pretty flat
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
going forward as a matter of fact for
 
02:01:26.810 --> 02:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
the hr17
 
02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
they show committee estimate I'm
 
02:01:31.669 --> 02:01:31.679 align:start position:0%
assuming this is billions three billion
 
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
115 million hundred thousand that would
 
02:01:37.790 --> 02:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
be based upon both
 
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
trust fund education trust fund and
 
02:01:42.490 --> 02:01:42.500 align:start position:0%
general fund and then they they go into
 
02:01:45.530 --> 02:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 3 billion one hundred and
 
02:01:48.890 --> 02:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
thirty four thousand 134 million which
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
is you know it's 19
 
02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
million more than 2023 and then they go
 
02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:56.890 align:start position:0%
million more than 2023 and then they go
into

02:01:56.890 --> 02:01:56.900 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:02:01.129 --> 02:02:01.139 align:start position:0%
2025 3 billion 135 already going up a
 
02:02:01.139 --> 02:02:02.510 align:start position:0%
2025 3 billion 135 already going up a
million

02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:02:05.870 --> 02:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
24 to 25 and
 
02:02:09.410 --> 02:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
they're they're going up some in in uh
 
02:02:13.790 --> 02:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
in 23 to 24 but not nearly enough to
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
cover all the things that we've heard
 
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
in our deliberations that's the problem
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
I encounter when
 
02:02:24.290 --> 02:02:24.300 align:start position:0%
we should have had this figure the same
 
02:02:26.450 --> 02:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
day we got the budget we've always had
 
02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
it in the past when you give us this
 
02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:30.420 align:start position:0%
kind of bad news after we sat here and
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
told kind of encouraged people tacitly
 
02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:34.980 align:start position:0%
by not saying no no no
 
02:02:37.129 --> 02:02:37.139 align:start position:0%
kind of tastly so okay how much more do
 
02:02:38.450 --> 02:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
you need and what do you need this for
 
02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
and I know the governor didn't give it
 
02:02:42.109 --> 02:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
to you maybe we can give it to you we
 
02:02:43.609 --> 02:02:43.619 align:start position:0%
can't even give you what the governor
 
02:02:43.619 --> 02:02:44.990 align:start position:0%
can't even give you what the governor
promised

02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
promised
 
02:02:49.370 --> 02:02:49.380 align:start position:0%
so it puts us in a tough position
 
02:02:52.370 --> 02:02:52.380 align:start position:0%
represent Griffin well it helps moving
 
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
forward I'll make a motion that we
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
retain this
 
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh bill
 
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
it's been moved in second and
 
02:03:03.470 --> 02:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
um see no further discussion I'm sorry
 
02:03:05.209 --> 02:03:05.219 align:start position:0%
representative Kayla we're now in our
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
voting stage so because Mr Mr erlinghill
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
said you needn't worry about this as far
 
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
as the budget
 
02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:15.370 align:start position:0%
as the budget
um

02:03:15.370 --> 02:03:15.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:18.109 --> 02:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
when we're behind and what the budget
 
02:03:19.850 --> 02:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
that's been handed to us
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
every nickel counts all right the motion
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
has been made and seconded to retain
 
02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:03:29.810 --> 02:03:29.820 align:start position:0%
um the clerical as their discussion yes
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire yeah I'm I'm
 
02:03:35.390 --> 02:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
actually so I voted against the bill but
 
02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
when it came out but I'm with
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Cahill in the sense that
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
I don't think this bill affects the
 
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
budget all right this up to four and a
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
half million I think up to could be zero
 
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
right so so
 
02:03:54.169 --> 02:03:54.179 align:start position:0%
I I think he's right and and and that
 
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
um Charlie allenhouse said that it's de
 
02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
minimis meaning almost nothing and to me
 
02:04:02.570 --> 02:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
that I think that's correct this is a
 
02:04:05.570 --> 02:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
standard labor bill that really is not
 
02:04:07.370 --> 02:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
about government right it's about
 
02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
everybody else right it's likely not to
 
02:04:12.530 --> 02:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
affect government employees exactly and
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
so therefore my preference would be to
 
02:04:19.370 --> 02:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
have it come out of the finance
 
02:04:21.290 --> 02:04:21.300 align:start position:0%
committee with no recommendation because
 
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
on the basis that it has no budget right
 
02:04:27.070 --> 02:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
aspect so
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's my thing I don't think that the
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
clerk will accept that coming from the
 
02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
second okay well then itl or ought to
 
02:04:36.649 --> 02:04:36.659 align:start position:0%
pass whatever because even when it came
 
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
to the flow with no recommendation yeah
 
02:04:41.089 --> 02:04:41.099 align:start position:0%
they had to be a dispositive motion I
 
02:04:41.099 --> 02:04:43.070 align:start position:0%
they had to be a dispositive motion I
understand

02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
understand
 
02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
ought to pass or Ito yeah I'm going to
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
support representative Griffin's motion
 
02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh this budget you know looking at again
 
02:04:54.010 --> 02:04:54.020 align:start position:0%
our financial
 
02:04:56.930 --> 02:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as a division
 
02:05:00.410 --> 02:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
it's going to at least affect 850 State
 
02:05:03.290 --> 02:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
Employees as a fiscal note says and it
 
02:05:05.930 --> 02:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
could be up to 4.5 million dollars in
 
02:05:08.270 --> 02:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
general funds so I think
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
um again that's my statement on it
 
02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
02:05:14.750 --> 02:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
also support representative Griffin's
 
02:05:17.330 --> 02:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
motion but um
 
02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
I actually would like to hear from uh
 
02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:21.550 align:start position:0%
I actually would like to hear from uh
Das

02:05:21.550 --> 02:05:21.560 align:start position:0%
Das
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
indepen not that I question what you're
 
02:05:26.209 --> 02:05:26.219 align:start position:0%
but it would be nice to have their
 
02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:33.410 align:start position:0%
 
roles

02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
roles
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
I know we're looking at this strictly as
 
02:05:37.070 --> 02:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
a financial thing because it's our job
 
02:05:41.330 --> 02:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
but um I I don't see the Merit of this
 
02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
bill knowing that the type of economy
 
02:05:46.850 --> 02:05:46.860 align:start position:0%
that we're in right now it's just good
 
02:05:48.649 --> 02:05:48.659 align:start position:0%
business to take care of your employees
 
02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:51.300 align:start position:0%
and to pay the vacation pay I think this
 
02:05:54.830 --> 02:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
is needless legislation and I would ask
 
02:05:57.770 --> 02:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
my representative friend to withdraw his
 
02:05:59.810 --> 02:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
motion so that another motion may be
 
02:06:04.609 --> 02:06:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:07.430 --> 02:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
president Griffin comments I'm willing
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
to withdraw on the basis that an Ito
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.729 --> 02:06:15.739 align:start position:0%
okay is there a second to that motion
 
02:06:18.589 --> 02:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
second second by representative McGuire
 
02:06:21.890 --> 02:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
again the motion is to itl
 
02:06:26.810 --> 02:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
uh I was still 74 FN
 
02:06:29.750 --> 02:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no further discussion like the
 
02:06:32.209 --> 02:06:32.219 align:start position:0%
clerk to please call the roll
 
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:06:37.129 --> 02:06:37.139 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate um
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
spill 74.
 
02:06:42.169 --> 02:06:42.179 align:start position:0%
when I call your name multiply the cea
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%

02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits
 
02:08:13.129 --> 02:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
I believe this bill came to us came off
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
was taken off the table at the last
 
02:08:18.050 --> 02:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
session of my memory serves me correctly
 
02:08:25.550 --> 02:08:25.560 align:start position:0%

McWilliams I represent South Concord and

districts so it's a pleasure to host you
 
02:09:00.290 --> 02:09:00.300 align:start position:0%

so I'm going to give you a little bit of
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
a background and overview as to how we
 
02:09:07.490 --> 02:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
got here and then hopefully talk about
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
what we can do for next steps moving
 
02:09:12.050 --> 02:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
forward to resolve the conundrum that we
 
02:09:14.530 --> 02:09:14.540 align:start position:0%
are in right now with the practice of
 
02:09:17.570 --> 02:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credit or wreck
 
02:09:19.970 --> 02:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
sweeping I'm going to do my best to
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
limit the number of acronyms that I use
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
but if I say something and it doesn't
 
02:09:27.169 --> 02:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
make sense please let me know science
 
02:09:28.550 --> 02:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
technology and energy is pretty
 
02:09:29.810 --> 02:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
Technical and we have a lot of
 
02:09:31.250 --> 02:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
abbreviations and I'm going to try to
 
02:09:33.530 --> 02:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
spell it out for you so thank you for
 
02:09:35.930 --> 02:09:35.940 align:start position:0%

and I'm just waiting for the handouts to
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
all right I think we're good enough to
 
02:09:57.960 --> 02:09:58.970 align:start position:0%
all right I think we're good enough to
start

02:09:58.970 --> 02:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
start
 
02:10:01.129 --> 02:10:01.139 align:start position:0%
uh so what I've what I've handed out and
 
02:10:02.450 --> 02:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk to this a little bit
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
after I give a background
 
02:10:08.570 --> 02:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
sorry the annual report from the
 
02:10:12.589 --> 02:10:12.599 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund from the most
 
02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
recent report year but I'm not going to
 
02:10:16.729 --> 02:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
dive into that quite yet it's highly
 
02:10:18.589 --> 02:10:18.599 align:start position:0%
technical document let me just back up
 
02:10:21.070 --> 02:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
and give you just a bit of an overview
 
02:10:25.010 --> 02:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
of what New Hampshire does in regards to
 
02:10:28.430 --> 02:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
our renewable portfolio standard or
 
02:10:31.070 --> 02:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
affectionately known as RPS
 
02:10:33.470 --> 02:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not familiar whether you've
 
02:10:35.689 --> 02:10:35.699 align:start position:0%
been before a division like this before
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
but we try to focus on what the fiscal
 
02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
impact okay on the state versus the
 
02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
policy since the policy vote has already
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
occurred I mean we may get into some of
 
02:10:47.810 --> 02:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
the policy but primarily what the fiscal
 
02:10:49.790 --> 02:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
impact may be on the state's budget
 
02:10:51.649 --> 02:10:51.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so in terms of
 
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard are you
 
02:10:55.490 --> 02:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
familiar with our renewable portfolio
 
02:10:58.129 --> 02:10:58.139 align:start position:0%
standard right now in terms of goals
 
02:11:00.589 --> 02:11:00.599 align:start position:0%
not as well as I should be okay so I'll
 
02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
just give you a little bit so you can
 
02:11:04.010 --> 02:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
understand what it's all about
 
02:11:05.810 --> 02:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
um because this bill impacts the
 
02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard and
 
02:11:10.250 --> 02:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
therefore some Financial impacts
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
um so we have a renewable portfolio
 
02:11:15.530 --> 02:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
standard requirement
 
02:11:16.910 --> 02:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
um it's established four different
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
classes of renewable energy resources
 
02:11:22.250 --> 02:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
this bill 234 really focuses on solar
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
okay so there are other renewable
 
02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
resources things like wind Hydro
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
Etc but really this is all about solar
 
02:11:36.770 --> 02:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
so uh the way this works is
 
02:11:39.530 --> 02:11:39.540 align:start position:0%
we are required as a state
 
02:11:39.540 --> 02:11:40.250 align:start position:0%
we are required as a state
um

02:11:40.250 --> 02:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:43.139 align:start position:0%
to push for certain percentage goals on
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard and the
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission or puc
 
02:11:50.689 --> 02:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
pushes these goals onto the utilities so
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
just as an example eversource is
 
02:11:54.530 --> 02:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
required to hit a certain percentage
 
02:11:57.530 --> 02:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard by either
 
02:12:00.890 --> 02:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
investing in Renewables or making
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments and they
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
have a choice as a business how they
 
02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
want to do that but they are required to
 
02:12:08.810 --> 02:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
meet these goals for the renewable
 
02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard in around 2013
 
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
we had a decision by the legislature to
 
02:12:20.689 --> 02:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
basically cut the way that this is done
 
02:12:22.970 --> 02:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
we enabled Renewable Energy Credit
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
sweeping we created what we call the rec
 
02:12:25.199 --> 02:12:26.750 align:start position:0%
sweeping we created what we call the rec
loophole

02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
02:12:28.250 --> 02:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
um and so what that means is when you
 
02:12:30.109 --> 02:12:30.119 align:start position:0%
have a solar customer who decides they
 
02:12:31.729 --> 02:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
want to put solar on their own rooftop
 
02:12:33.530 --> 02:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
generally this is residential but not
 
02:12:35.649 --> 02:12:35.659 align:start position:0%
always it could be a small business
 
02:12:37.850 --> 02:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
someone in New Hampshire decides they
 
02:12:39.890 --> 02:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
want to put panels on the rooftop and
 
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
they are eligible for renewable energy
 
02:12:43.609 --> 02:12:43.619 align:start position:0%
credits for those panels that they put
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
on the rooftop
 
02:12:47.450 --> 02:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
however the paperwork is kind of a
 
02:12:49.250 --> 02:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
hassle and the amount of money that you
 
02:12:50.689 --> 02:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
make as a small producer is generally
 
02:12:53.089 --> 02:12:53.099 align:start position:0%
between 20 and 40 dollars a year so
 
02:12:55.550 --> 02:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
often renewable energy producers like
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
myself I have panels decide not to do
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
the process and not to apply and so
 
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
those wrecks are not applied they don't
 
02:13:06.470 --> 02:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
go anywhere they aren't able to get the
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
benefit of the value of those wrecks
 
02:13:10.910 --> 02:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
each year as that market and so we
 
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
created a bill wreck sweeping to allow
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
utilities to sweep those racks that
 
02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
don't go claimed within a year and they
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
apply them to their renewable portfolio
 
02:13:23.209 --> 02:13:23.219 align:start position:0%
standard requirement where they have to
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
hit a certain percentage with Renewables
 
02:13:27.410 --> 02:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
generally solar is the one that they're
 
02:13:28.850 --> 02:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
sweeping because that's what this bill
 
02:13:31.550 --> 02:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
is about so we're talking about the
 
02:13:33.410 --> 02:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
value and it really is a financial value
 
02:13:35.689 --> 02:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
of those credits being
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
swept or gifted to our utilities the
 
02:13:42.109 --> 02:13:42.119 align:start position:0%
actual value is somewhat in contest and
 
02:13:43.550 --> 02:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
I think we would have to probably get
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
testimony from the utilities because
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
each one handles it differently they can
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
either do alternative compliance
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
payments or they can purchase renewable
 
02:13:53.089 --> 02:13:53.099 align:start position:0%
energy credits but because they're
 
02:13:54.530 --> 02:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
getting renewable energy credits for
 
02:13:57.950 --> 02:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
free in the latest data it appears that
 
02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
eversource for 2022 will be able to
 
02:14:03.649 --> 02:14:03.659 align:start position:0%
break even and not need to make any
 
02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credit purchases or
 
02:14:08.209 --> 02:14:08.219 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments in order
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
to meet its report renewable portfolio
 
02:14:14.270 --> 02:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
standard for for a mix why is this
 
02:14:15.470 --> 02:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
important and why does it matter to
 
02:14:17.330 --> 02:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
finance well obviously there's a dollar
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
value associated with that in terms of
 
02:14:22.729 --> 02:14:22.739 align:start position:0%
where the money goes and how it's spent
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
so um those those alternative compliance
 
02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
payments that this legislature in you
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
know 2009 when this all was set up we
 
02:14:34.729 --> 02:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
intended as a legislature in 2009 that
 
02:14:37.010 --> 02:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
those alternative compliance payments
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
made by utilities would go into the
 
02:14:41.810 --> 02:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund okay so we have a
 
02:14:43.370 --> 02:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
bucket of money called the renewable
 
02:14:46.370 --> 02:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
energy fund and it goes to various
 
02:14:49.129 --> 02:14:49.139 align:start position:0%
sources and we'll get into the details
 
02:14:51.410 --> 02:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
in the report that I distributed but the
 
02:14:53.209 --> 02:14:53.219 align:start position:0%
intention there is to make sure that a
 
02:14:54.890 --> 02:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
project that wouldn't pencil out without
 
02:14:57.530 --> 02:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
a grant or some support from the
 
02:15:00.109 --> 02:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund does then pencil
 
02:15:01.970 --> 02:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
out with those funds and we've seen that
 
02:15:03.709 --> 02:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
the return on investment is either a
 
02:15:05.810 --> 02:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
three to one or a four to one so it's
 
02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
definitely worthwhile to have the bucket
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
of money in the renewable energy fund
 
02:15:11.569 --> 02:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
and to make those grants available so
 
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
just for an example um let's just say
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
your high school is considering doing
 
02:15:17.569 --> 02:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
biomass for heat and they know that the
 
02:15:19.609 --> 02:15:19.619 align:start position:0%
cost is a hundred thousand dollars
 
02:15:23.569 --> 02:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
approximately 17 of that or 17 000 could
 
02:15:25.370 --> 02:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
be a grant from the renewable energy
 
02:15:27.410 --> 02:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
fund and the remainder would be funded
 
02:15:29.810 --> 02:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
by the town for the high school if that
 
02:15:31.970 --> 02:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
makes sense so it makes it pencil when
 
02:15:33.770 --> 02:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
otherwise it would not pencil to use the
 
02:15:35.810 --> 02:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
money from the renewable energy fund so
 
02:15:37.490 --> 02:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
the conundrum we find ourselves in right
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
now is unfortunately
 
02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
um the renewable energy fund is not
 
02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
receiving those alternative compliance
 
02:15:45.410 --> 02:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
payments from the utilities because
 
02:15:46.970 --> 02:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
they're wreck sweeping and they're
 
02:15:48.890 --> 02:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
getting these free wrecks from people
 
02:15:50.569 --> 02:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
who've decided not to apply for their
 
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
own wrecks and and therefore it has
 
02:15:55.490 --> 02:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
undermined the entire intention of the
 
02:15:57.470 --> 02:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
program because we end up not filling
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
out the renewable energy fund and not
 
02:16:01.850 --> 02:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
being able to make these grants to
 
02:16:03.890 --> 02:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
deserving applicants including our own
 
02:16:06.250 --> 02:16:06.260 align:start position:0%
cities and towns
 
02:16:10.430 --> 02:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
so just to get back to to the basics the
 
02:16:13.790 --> 02:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh the average cost if we were to remove
 
02:16:15.770 --> 02:16:15.780 align:start position:0%
Renewable Energy Credit sweeping wreck
 
02:16:18.410 --> 02:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
sweeping is approximately six cents per
 
02:16:20.569 --> 02:16:20.579 align:start position:0%
month for your average consumers this
 
02:16:22.390 --> 02:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
would be residential electric rate pair
 
02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
I do want to make a note that in 2013
 
02:16:29.209 --> 02:16:29.219 align:start position:0%
when we decided as a legislature to do
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
some wreck sweeping
 
02:16:34.910 --> 02:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
that Sixth Sense went from the um from
 
02:16:38.270 --> 02:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
the rate pair to benefit the utility and
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
therefore it would have been a discount
 
02:16:41.450 --> 02:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
right we should have seen six cents go
 
02:16:43.790 --> 02:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
down in our in our bills but we didn't
 
02:16:45.889 --> 02:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
we didn't see any change at all
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
and so it was kind of all you know
 
02:16:50.810 --> 02:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
pennies here pennies there but big quick
 
02:16:52.669 --> 02:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
picture the question is okay if six
 
02:16:54.290 --> 02:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
cents just kind of disappeared there was
 
02:16:56.990 --> 02:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
no puc rate case open for eversource to
 
02:16:58.910 --> 02:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
say oh yeah I got the benefit of six
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
cents a month per utility payer uh
 
02:17:02.629 --> 02:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
through Rec sweeping so therefore I
 
02:17:04.490 --> 02:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
should reduce their bill didn't happen
 
02:17:07.969 --> 02:17:07.979 align:start position:0%
Okay so all this is to say that um you
 
02:17:10.429 --> 02:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
know it it does add up but the actual
 
02:17:12.349 --> 02:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
value is really a question of what the
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
value is on the rec Market
 
02:17:16.490 --> 02:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
so you may have heard testimony and I
 
02:17:17.870 --> 02:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
just want to rebut the record for some
 
02:17:19.730 --> 02:17:19.740 align:start position:0%
of the testimony you may have heard on
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
the house floor one of them was the
 
02:17:23.209 --> 02:17:23.219 align:start position:0%
claim that this was a three million
 
02:17:25.250 --> 02:17:25.260 align:start position:0%
dollar increase to rate payers every
 
02:17:28.009 --> 02:17:28.019 align:start position:0%
year the three million dollars I
 
02:17:29.810 --> 02:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
question that because it looks like Rex
 
02:17:31.849 --> 02:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
are only selling at fifteen dollars
 
02:17:35.089 --> 02:17:35.099 align:start position:0%
right now if Rex were selling at 55 I
 
02:17:36.410 --> 02:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
think three million would make more
 
02:17:38.330 --> 02:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
sense but because Rex you're selling at
 
02:17:41.089 --> 02:17:41.099 align:start position:0%
15 I would say we're closer to a million
 
02:17:43.490 --> 02:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
and then big picture are the utilities
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
actually going to adjust their rates to
 
02:17:47.450 --> 02:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
address what is considered to be pennies
 
02:17:49.849 --> 02:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
right now I don't think so I don't see
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
that being part of this
 
02:17:52.910 --> 02:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's important to address
 
02:17:55.250 --> 02:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
that piece and then another comment that
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
happened on the house floor during
 
02:17:58.490 --> 02:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
debate was that um the department of
 
02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
energy is actually neutral on this bill
 
02:18:02.209 --> 02:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
and they testified at St that they're
 
02:18:05.209 --> 02:18:05.219 align:start position:0%
neutral so they they have not officially
 
02:18:06.889 --> 02:18:06.899 align:start position:0%
taken a stance as to whether they are
 
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
pro or against removing Wreck sweepings
 
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
All right so now I'm ready to dive into
 
02:18:12.709 --> 02:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
the handouts that you've all received
 
02:18:15.049 --> 02:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
let's start with page nine
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:24.770 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:18:24.770 --> 02:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
and this is in the overall Staples
 
02:18:29.570 --> 02:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
annual report as well as Loosely
 
02:18:31.070 --> 02:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
highlighted I didn't highlight the
 
02:18:33.889 --> 02:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
report for you but here we go so we're
 
02:18:36.110 --> 02:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the chart on the bottom in
 
02:18:38.330 --> 02:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
regards to Alternative compliance
 
02:18:41.450 --> 02:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
payments and we've talked about this in
 
02:18:45.110 --> 02:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
2012 Class 2 which is our solar
 
02:18:48.770 --> 02:18:48.780 align:start position:0%
we were making 168 dollars and 13 cents
 
02:18:51.650 --> 02:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
at an old ACP payment rate
 
02:18:54.169 --> 02:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
we lost two-thirds of that when wreck
 
02:18:56.990 --> 02:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
sweeping happened in 2013 it went down
 
02:19:00.589 --> 02:19:00.599 align:start position:0%
to 55 per
 
02:19:03.410 --> 02:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour and so we lost two-thirds
 
02:19:05.810 --> 02:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
of the value because we no longer had
 
02:19:05.820 --> 02:19:07.009 align:start position:0%
of the value because we no longer had
those

02:19:07.009 --> 02:19:07.019 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:19:09.830 --> 02:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
um those credits available so that's the
 
02:19:12.349 --> 02:19:12.359 align:start position:0%
history okay so I'm gonna have you turn
 
02:19:15.950 --> 02:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
from that one to page 19 in your report
 
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
it looks like this big chart with
 
02:19:22.310 --> 02:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
dollars small pie graph on the bottom
 
02:19:25.610 --> 02:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:25.620 --> 02:19:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
so this is the example where you have a
 
02:19:33.290 --> 02:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
project that may not pencil out without
 
02:19:36.530 --> 02:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund Grant being
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
applied and so when we're looking at a
 
02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
solar project the the pie chart is
 
02:19:42.650 --> 02:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
really what I want to call your
 
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
attention to 87 percent
 
02:19:47.870 --> 02:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
of whatever that project is is going to
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
be paid for either by the city the town
 
02:19:53.090 --> 02:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
or it could be a private investor but
 
02:19:56.330 --> 02:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
that that is not something that we are
 
02:19:58.190 --> 02:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
handling as a legislature of the state
 
02:20:02.090 --> 02:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
that 13 is the renewable energy fund
 
02:20:04.310 --> 02:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
that kicks in as a grant to help get
 
02:20:06.410 --> 02:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
this project across the finish line and
 
02:20:08.570 --> 02:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
we certainly have seen that for example
 
02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:09.170 align:start position:0%
we certainly have seen that for example
um

02:20:09.170 --> 02:20:09.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:11.210 --> 02:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
you know we we have some State nursing
 
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
homes that do use biomass and we're able
 
02:20:15.710 --> 02:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
to get that 13 renewable energy fund
 
02:20:17.570 --> 02:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
investment to get over the finish line
 
02:20:19.730 --> 02:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
and do the project
 
02:20:19.740 --> 02:20:20.630 align:start position:0%
and do the project
um

02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
just want to be super clear on that one
 
02:20:24.349 --> 02:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
all right now finally we're going to
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
turn to page 21
 
02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
um of the renewable energy fund annual
 
02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
report and this looks like chart on the
 
02:20:36.530 --> 02:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
top two pie charts on the bottom
 
02:20:36.540 --> 02:20:38.690 align:start position:0%
top two pie charts on the bottom
okay

02:20:38.690 --> 02:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:20:41.210 --> 02:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
okay so this is really focusing on
 
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
non-residential competitive grants so
 
02:20:45.349 --> 02:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about
 
02:20:45.359 --> 02:20:46.250 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about
um

02:20:46.250 --> 02:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
who benefits from the money in the
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund if you look at the
 
02:20:51.650 --> 02:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
chart that I've highlighted in the lower
 
02:20:54.590 --> 02:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
left corner the pie chart shows that 48
 
02:20:57.590 --> 02:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
percent are private entities and I it's
 
02:20:59.090 --> 02:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
hard to read the printout so I put a
 
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
little color on it but 48 are private
 
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
entities which means that 52 percent
 
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
of those who are benefiting from the
 
02:21:08.450 --> 02:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
residential I'm sorry non-residential
 
02:21:10.849 --> 02:21:10.859 align:start position:0%
competitive grant our our municipalities
 
02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
our schools wastewater treatment
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
facilities and County government so this
 
02:21:16.610 --> 02:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund is really
 
02:21:18.349 --> 02:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
benefiting us and we're able to take it
 
02:21:20.690 --> 02:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
home and bring home the bacon to our own
 
02:21:22.370 --> 02:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
constituents through the renewable
 
02:21:25.130 --> 02:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
energy fund so all of this is really
 
02:21:27.889 --> 02:21:27.899 align:start position:0%
kind of a background to say that we have
 
02:21:29.809 --> 02:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
the vehicle in the renewable energy fund
 
02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we have removed the
 
02:21:34.730 --> 02:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
ability to fund it through alternative
 
02:21:36.349 --> 02:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
compliance payments because we've been
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
giving wrecks to utilities for free and
 
02:21:41.330 --> 02:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
so therefore the dollars that we have
 
02:21:42.889 --> 02:21:42.899 align:start position:0%
right now to deal with are about
 
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
two-thirds less than they would have
 
02:21:47.929 --> 02:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
been if we had not done Rec sweeping and
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of my Dollar's
 
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
description I'll I'll let me go through
 
02:21:53.150 --> 02:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
that one more time
 
02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:54.790 align:start position:0%
that one more time
so

02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:56.809 --> 02:21:56.819 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:21:59.330 --> 02:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
uh what we have is
 
02:22:01.309 --> 02:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
a renewable energy fund that's set up
 
02:22:03.170 --> 02:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
it's about it's a vehicle to receive
 
02:22:04.969 --> 02:22:04.979 align:start position:0%
money from alternative compliance
 
02:22:06.770 --> 02:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
payments that are paid by the utilities
 
02:22:09.889 --> 02:22:09.899 align:start position:0%
or they could also invest in wrecks they
 
02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
could be buying wrecks as well so they
 
02:22:15.230 --> 02:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
have two ways of getting money into the
 
02:22:16.490 --> 02:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
um the fund
 
02:22:19.010 --> 02:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
so that's the intention there is to fund
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
it we set it up so that we could get
 
02:22:23.210 --> 02:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
these benefits for our own cities and
 
02:22:23.220 --> 02:22:24.530 align:start position:0%
these benefits for our own cities and
towns

02:22:24.530 --> 02:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
towns
 
02:22:27.670 --> 02:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
um two-thirds of it has basically been
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
removed from 2012 to 2013 because we got
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
rid of the ability for utilities to make
 
02:22:36.170 --> 02:22:36.180 align:start position:0%
those alternative compliance payments
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
they simply swept the wrecks instead to
 
02:22:40.309 --> 02:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
apply to the renewable portfolio
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
standard and therefore we no longer have
 
02:22:45.530 --> 02:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
that huge benefit that pays off three to
 
02:22:48.290 --> 02:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
one or four to one for our cities and
 
02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
towns because we've basically given free
 
02:22:53.809 --> 02:22:53.819 align:start position:0%
money to utilities and you've probably
 
02:22:55.550 --> 02:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
heard all the other policy arguments but
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
this is just the financial description
 
02:22:58.849 --> 02:22:58.859 align:start position:0%
of what's happening right now with the
 
02:23:01.370 --> 02:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard being met
 
02:23:03.770 --> 02:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
through Rex sweeping and therefore
 
02:23:05.929 --> 02:23:05.939 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments and Rex
 
02:23:07.730 --> 02:23:07.740 align:start position:0%
not being purchased and therefore
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund being completely
 
02:23:12.110 --> 02:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
depleted thank you representative
 
02:23:14.210 --> 02:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
McGuire has a question yes thank you
 
02:23:14.220 --> 02:23:15.889 align:start position:0%
McGuire has a question yes thank you
representative

02:23:15.889 --> 02:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:23:15.899 --> 02:23:16.610 align:start position:0%
representative
um

02:23:16.610 --> 02:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
you said that racks are now at fifteen
 
02:23:22.250 --> 02:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
dollars but the alternative compliance
 
02:23:25.190 --> 02:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
payment on this chart is more like 60 or
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
something right excellent point okay so
 
02:23:31.090 --> 02:23:31.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:34.370 --> 02:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
would there be any why are there any
 
02:23:36.349 --> 02:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments wouldn't
 
02:23:38.389 --> 02:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the utility just go by the
 
02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
wreck for fifteen dollars instead of 60.
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
you know that's really an Ever Source
 
02:23:44.630 --> 02:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
question because that's exactly what
 
02:23:46.309 --> 02:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
they're doing right now they're a very
 
02:23:48.770 --> 02:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
large utility they manage portfolios in
 
02:23:50.929 --> 02:23:50.939 align:start position:0%
multiple States so the easiest and
 
02:23:52.969 --> 02:23:52.979 align:start position:0%
simplest thing to do and by the way that
 
02:23:55.490 --> 02:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
55 is set in statute so that's a puc
 
02:23:57.650 --> 02:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
decision to make it 55 but the actual
 
02:24:00.110 --> 02:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
Market is 15. so eversources made the
 
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
decision because they're big and I'll
 
02:24:03.530 --> 02:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
let them speak for themselves if they're
 
02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
here but they're big so they've decided
 
02:24:08.090 --> 02:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
it's easier for us to just do this and
 
02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
make the payment and move on rather than
 
02:24:12.889 --> 02:24:12.899 align:start position:0%
hunting for renewable energy credits to
 
02:24:15.530 --> 02:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
make the purchase from local energy
 
02:24:19.969 --> 02:24:19.979 align:start position:0%
suppliers so they could but they're not
 
02:24:22.429 --> 02:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
oh I see so you're saying they do make
 
02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments well
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
they're they're making a very small
 
02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:27.170 align:start position:0%
they're they're making a very small
amount

02:24:27.170 --> 02:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
amount
 
02:24:30.170 --> 02:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
um as of 2021 whatever as of 2022
 
02:24:31.730 --> 02:24:31.740 align:start position:0%
they'll have swept everything so they
 
02:24:33.650 --> 02:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
don't need to make those ACP payments
 
02:24:37.130 --> 02:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
anymore right let me make so is the only
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
source of money to the renewable energy
 
02:24:41.270 --> 02:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
fund these alternative compliance
 
02:24:43.370 --> 02:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
payments or are there other places other
 
02:24:46.670 --> 02:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
things that yes that's it okay and so
 
02:24:49.429 --> 02:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
your main goal is more money in the
 
02:24:52.910 --> 02:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund right if if the
 
02:24:56.809 --> 02:24:56.819 align:start position:0%
wreck value went back to people like
 
02:24:56.819 --> 02:24:57.910 align:start position:0%
wreck value went back to people like
yourself

02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
instead of going to eversource
 
02:25:04.969 --> 02:25:04.979 align:start position:0%
right so you there are people that that
 
02:25:06.710 --> 02:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
get their wrecked value because they
 
02:25:08.270 --> 02:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
apply for it and they get it they get
 
02:25:10.490 --> 02:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
twenty to forty dollars but but if all
 
02:25:12.530 --> 02:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
the people who are getting swept If
 
02:25:15.230 --> 02:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
instead they actually got the value of
 
02:25:18.469 --> 02:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
their racks that would not satisfy you
 
02:25:20.330 --> 02:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
because your main goal is to get more
 
02:25:23.450 --> 02:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
money into this fund is that right
 
02:25:25.969 --> 02:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a two-pronged problem okay
 
02:25:28.370 --> 02:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
as an attorney
 
02:25:30.710 --> 02:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
I am concerned about
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
robbing Peter to pay Paul right the
 
02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
people who these wrecks belong to it's a
 
02:25:38.990 --> 02:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
taking they don't have notice so that's
 
02:25:41.389 --> 02:25:41.399 align:start position:0%
its own issue in terms of making them
 
02:25:42.830 --> 02:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
whole and allowing them to have their
 
02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
wrecks or making it an opt-out rather an
 
02:25:46.849 --> 02:25:46.859 align:start position:0%
opt-in there's things you could do there
 
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
but it's a problem right now the way
 
02:25:50.809 --> 02:25:50.819 align:start position:0%
it's being administered it's right per
 
02:25:53.389 --> 02:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
class action lawsuit leaving that aside
 
02:25:56.210 --> 02:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
the intention of the renewable energy
 
02:25:58.910 --> 02:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
fund the whole purpose was to create a
 
02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
bucket to to then collect these monies
 
02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
from the utilities and benefit our
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
cities and towns and our constituents
 
02:26:10.730 --> 02:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
who need additional Grant funds to
 
02:26:13.070 --> 02:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
pencil a project but let's back up for a
 
02:26:14.929 --> 02:26:14.939 align:start position:0%
second let's take take a quick look at
 
02:26:16.969 --> 02:26:16.979 align:start position:0%
what we're doing as a state when we talk
 
02:26:19.070 --> 02:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
about our renewable portfolio standard
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
okay we've set percentage goals that
 
02:26:24.050 --> 02:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
through the pcpuc our utilities need to
 
02:26:26.090 --> 02:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
hit those renewable portfolio standard
 
02:26:28.429 --> 02:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
goals economically I think you're all in
 
02:26:29.929 --> 02:26:29.939 align:start position:0%
this room because you understand the
 
02:26:32.990 --> 02:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
finances of Economics we do not want to
 
02:26:35.389 --> 02:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
have just one or two different types of
 
02:26:37.610 --> 02:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
energy in our pool that we're using for
 
02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because it subjects us to
 
02:26:41.929 --> 02:26:41.939 align:start position:0%
Market volatility right so that's kind
 
02:26:43.309 --> 02:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
of the situation we've unfortunately
 
02:26:45.530 --> 02:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
ended up in right now due to
 
02:26:48.349 --> 02:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
International demand for natural gas and
 
02:26:50.389 --> 02:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
of course the situation in Ukraine okay
 
02:26:53.150 --> 02:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
so we have this portfolio that is made
 
02:26:55.790 --> 02:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
up of mostly natural gas with you know
 
02:26:58.010 --> 02:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
some nuclear and some other small hydro
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
and very small solar but our portfolio
 
02:27:02.030 --> 02:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
is really heavily natural gas right now
 
02:27:04.250 --> 02:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard was
 
02:27:07.490 --> 02:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
intended to diversify our mix and so by
 
02:27:10.010 --> 02:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
allowing Rec sweeping and undermining
 
02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
the intention of the renewable portfolio
 
02:27:14.450 --> 02:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
standard where you could either do buy
 
02:27:16.250 --> 02:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
more wrecks purchase more wrecks or make
 
02:27:18.770 --> 02:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments that was
 
02:27:20.929 --> 02:27:20.939 align:start position:0%
to incentivize utilities to mix it up
 
02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
and get more Renewables in the mix so
 
02:27:25.610 --> 02:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
we're not so dependent on fossil fuels
 
02:27:28.490 --> 02:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
just because financially it hurts us as
 
02:27:31.790 --> 02:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
a state and so undermining the renewable
 
02:27:34.010 --> 02:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard by continuing to
 
02:27:36.290 --> 02:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
allow Rec sweeping is actually hurting
 
02:27:39.170 --> 02:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
our our investment mix
 
02:27:43.370 --> 02:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
let me let me ask it this way so is the
 
02:27:45.290 --> 02:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
amount being swept
 
02:27:49.730 --> 02:27:49.740 align:start position:0%
that actually is solar power right or do
 
02:27:52.849 --> 02:27:52.859 align:start position:0%
you argue that that's that's wrong that
 
02:27:54.830 --> 02:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
the amount being swept
 
02:27:57.710 --> 02:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't really exist oh it certainly
 
02:27:59.809 --> 02:27:59.819 align:start position:0%
exists it's a dollar value because it's
 
02:28:01.610 --> 02:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
cost avoided on the utilities what I'm
 
02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
saying is it represents actual solar
 
02:28:07.070 --> 02:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
power right like yours you said yours is
 
02:28:08.690 --> 02:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
being swept right mine is not actually
 
02:28:10.910 --> 02:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
being swept oh okay for work and I get
 
02:28:12.429 --> 02:28:12.439 align:start position:0%
my twenty dollars
 
02:28:12.439 --> 02:28:14.110 align:start position:0%
my twenty dollars
so

02:28:14.110 --> 02:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
some other person Mr Jones or there's
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
somebody there's this being swept right
 
02:28:23.270 --> 02:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
so that's actual solar power
 
02:28:25.690 --> 02:28:25.700 align:start position:0%
it's the value of the renewable energy
 
02:28:29.570 --> 02:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
certificates right so so at the time the
 
02:28:31.610 --> 02:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
solar turns into electricity you have
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
your wreck as soon as it converts yeah
 
02:28:37.849 --> 02:28:37.859 align:start position:0%
so but my point is it's not that
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
you're you're saying that the the
 
02:28:42.410 --> 02:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
purpose of the program is being uh
 
02:28:45.050 --> 02:28:45.060 align:start position:0%
compromised but not really right because
 
02:28:48.410 --> 02:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
the amount being swept is actual solar
 
02:28:51.410 --> 02:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
power and so we are producing from solar
 
02:28:55.490 --> 02:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
yes or or no okay so I think when when
 
02:28:57.290 --> 02:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
you say it's not being compromised
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
because there is some solar applied to
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
unitils RPS requirement right there is
 
02:29:03.410 --> 02:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
some solar it is being applied to
 
02:29:05.690 --> 02:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
unitil's RPS requirement right but it's
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
not their solar they haven't gone out
 
02:29:09.290 --> 02:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
and found a local supplier to support
 
02:29:11.210 --> 02:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
and they certainly haven't paid the
 
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
puc's 55 for an alternative compliance
 
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
payment so they found a loophole
 
02:29:19.849 --> 02:29:19.859 align:start position:0%
we've created a loophole so what's
 
02:29:22.969 --> 02:29:22.979 align:start position:0%
happening here is it doesn't belong to
 
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
Unitil but we've allowed them to kind of
 
02:29:27.170 --> 02:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
reach in and grab it and then they have
 
02:29:29.210 --> 02:29:29.220 align:start position:0%
cost avoided by doing that but they also
 
02:29:31.010 --> 02:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
don't meet the goals not really because
 
02:29:32.570 --> 02:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
they're not doing what we set them up to
 
02:29:32.580 --> 02:29:34.330 align:start position:0%
they're not doing what we set them up to
do

02:29:34.330 --> 02:29:34.340 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:29:36.410 --> 02:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative Ebel followed by
 
02:29:38.990 --> 02:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
02:29:41.090 --> 02:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:29:43.010 --> 02:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
all your explanations so now I'm going
 
02:29:44.809 --> 02:29:44.819 align:start position:0%
to ask a question which may indicate
 
02:29:48.349 --> 02:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
that I don't really understand but
 
02:29:50.990 --> 02:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to a lot of what we're
 
02:29:53.330 --> 02:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
talking about here seems like a policy
 
02:29:55.849 --> 02:29:55.859 align:start position:0%
discussion and so what I'm trying to
 
02:29:58.490 --> 02:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
figure out is you know we're supposed to
 
02:30:01.010 --> 02:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
be assessing the fiscal effect on the
 
02:30:02.929 --> 02:30:02.939 align:start position:0%
budget so
 
02:30:05.690 --> 02:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
could you explain that
 
02:30:08.210 --> 02:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
because I don't
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
I don't see a lot but that's what I I
 
02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
mean it says here it wouldn't impact
 
02:30:15.650 --> 02:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
revenues and it says expenditures are
 
02:30:19.849 --> 02:30:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:22.250 --> 02:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
I can't see where the expenditure is
 
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
here unless I I don't
 
02:30:30.530 --> 02:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
I questioned why this was an FN bill
 
02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
I haven't received a really good
 
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
explanation as to why this is an FN bill
 
02:30:38.090 --> 02:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
I imagine there might be a slightly
 
02:30:40.910 --> 02:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
reduced administrative cost of the
 
02:30:40.920 --> 02:30:42.290 align:start position:0%
reduced administrative cost of the
actual

02:30:42.290 --> 02:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
actual
 
02:30:44.450 --> 02:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
um fund
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
possibly but the actual wreck sweeping
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
process of taking certificates from
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
residential solar producers who do not
 
02:30:55.010 --> 02:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
fill out the paperwork and applying it
 
02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
to utilities there may be some saved
 
02:30:59.929 --> 02:30:59.939 align:start position:0%
administrative cost on that through this
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill possibly
 
02:31:07.790 --> 02:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:10.429 --> 02:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
likable State counties and and local
 
02:31:13.010 --> 02:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
governments might see their electricity
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
increase by an indeterminable amount but
 
02:31:16.319 --> 02:31:17.090 align:start position:0%
increase by an indeterminable amount but
I

02:31:17.090 --> 02:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:31:18.889 --> 02:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
I mean that's
 
02:31:21.410 --> 02:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
feels to me really
 
02:31:24.590 --> 02:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
stretching the possibility of
 
02:31:28.969 --> 02:31:28.979 align:start position:0%
anyway to me I don't see a big effect on
 
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
the budget and certainly nothing that we
 
02:31:33.410 --> 02:31:33.420 align:start position:0%
would pencil in anywhere
 
02:31:35.389 --> 02:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ebel for the
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
comment slash question
 
02:31:39.710 --> 02:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
um I would say that once again when we
 
02:31:42.770 --> 02:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
when this took effect in 2013 we didn't
 
02:31:45.050 --> 02:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
see any evidence of lowering rates from
 
02:31:46.969 --> 02:31:46.979 align:start position:0%
the utilities there was no puc case open
 
02:31:48.770 --> 02:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
to say we need to save our ratepayers
 
02:31:50.330 --> 02:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
and funds because we've decided to do
 
02:31:53.210 --> 02:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
wreck sweeping and likewise if we were
 
02:31:55.130 --> 02:31:55.140 align:start position:0%
to remove sweat wreck sweeping I do not
 
02:31:57.230 --> 02:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
expect to see a puc case open to say
 
02:31:58.730 --> 02:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
this is going to increase because it's
 
02:32:03.230 --> 02:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
de minimis it's six cents per per um per
 
02:32:09.170 --> 02:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:11.150 --> 02:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:32:14.450 --> 02:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
so you have solar on your roof
 
02:32:16.130 --> 02:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
it's Grandma but okay
 
02:32:17.929 --> 02:32:17.939 align:start position:0%
how do you get paid for that did they
 
02:32:20.770 --> 02:32:20.780 align:start position:0%
deduct it off your electric bill
 
02:32:23.929 --> 02:32:23.939 align:start position:0%
for my residential solar I have a
 
02:32:26.510 --> 02:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
ground-mounted solar system solar array
 
02:32:28.490 --> 02:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
and each month I have a negative
 
02:32:31.730 --> 02:32:31.740 align:start position:0%
electric bill from Unitil so it's and
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
once a year I have an opportunity to
 
02:32:37.309 --> 02:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
contact Unitil and say I'd like that
 
02:32:39.770 --> 02:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
negative credit applied to a different
 
02:32:39.780 --> 02:32:40.849 align:start position:0%
negative credit applied to a different
bill

02:32:40.849 --> 02:32:40.859 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:32:44.389 --> 02:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
but I don't ever see a check
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
so with that negative credit they in
 
02:32:49.010 --> 02:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
effect are buying electricity they are
 
02:32:51.050 --> 02:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
buying solar generated electricity from
 
02:32:54.170 --> 02:32:54.180 align:start position:0%
you which is a renewable
 
02:32:58.010 --> 02:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
yes so when they sweep it
 
02:32:59.870 --> 02:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
they're taking the credit for that same
 
02:33:02.270 --> 02:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
as they would for any other
 
02:33:05.090 --> 02:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
so I've generated that that was a
 
02:33:08.030 --> 02:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
renewable so I don't see why that's the
 
02:33:10.429 --> 02:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
wrong thing to do they have paid you
 
02:33:12.889 --> 02:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
for that electricity so they are taking
 
02:33:16.490 --> 02:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
credit for a renewable thing so I don't
 
02:33:19.090 --> 02:33:19.100 align:start position:0%
see why you object to that because
 
02:33:22.730 --> 02:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
overall it's it's helping us all plus
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
02:33:26.809 --> 02:33:26.819 align:start position:0%
they go to the Public Utilities
 
02:33:29.510 --> 02:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
Commission on a regular basis for rate
 
02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:30.950 align:start position:0%
Commission on a regular basis for rate
adjustments

02:33:30.950 --> 02:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
02:33:32.570 --> 02:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
and they're allowed a return on
 
02:33:34.190 --> 02:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
investment or they would just go out of
 
02:33:36.050 --> 02:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
business so even though there are Public
 
02:33:37.969 --> 02:33:37.979 align:start position:0%
Utilities they're very controlled they
 
02:33:39.610 --> 02:33:39.620 align:start position:0%
have to show all their expenses
 
02:33:42.590 --> 02:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
including all the ice storms and all the
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
outages and all the things they've had
 
02:33:47.210 --> 02:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
to be to be repaired so every year
 
02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
they're trying for every last dollar
 
02:33:52.610 --> 02:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
so if if your bill passes they're going
 
02:33:54.410 --> 02:33:54.420 align:start position:0%
to have to give you some money and it's
 
02:33:55.730 --> 02:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
going to come out of all the other rate
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
payers it's my only conclusion in this
 
02:34:00.290 --> 02:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
in this Bill thank you
 
02:34:02.270 --> 02:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
can I respond to that
 
02:34:04.250 --> 02:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
okay um first I just want to explain how
 
02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
the process works so yes I'm a solar
 
02:34:09.170 --> 02:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
producer at my house and there are times
 
02:34:11.090 --> 02:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
when I get a credit for producing more
 
02:34:13.429 --> 02:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
solar than I use but I don't ever get a
 
02:34:15.830 --> 02:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
check for it it's just a a negative
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
balance there is a bright line between
 
02:34:18.479 --> 02:34:19.730 align:start position:0%
balance there is a bright line between
that

02:34:19.730 --> 02:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:34:21.889 --> 02:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
and actually applying for doing the
 
02:34:24.410 --> 02:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
paperwork and getting renewable energy
 
02:34:27.410 --> 02:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
certificate for what I'm producing which
 
02:34:30.410 --> 02:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
is then sold at auction four times a
 
02:34:32.750 --> 02:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
year and the value that comes back at
 
02:34:34.429 --> 02:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
auction can come to me in the form of a
 
02:34:36.950 --> 02:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
check where I actually receive funds but
 
02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
if I fail to fill out the paperwork then
 
02:34:43.010 --> 02:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
that value gets swept by Unitil my
 
02:34:45.290 --> 02:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
utility and they get the dollar value so
 
02:34:47.330 --> 02:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a strong difference
 
02:34:50.330 --> 02:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
between actually what I'm doing with my
 
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
bill which never turns into any real
 
02:34:54.530 --> 02:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
dollars and the certificates which are
 
02:34:57.410 --> 02:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
solid dollars and that's the piece that
 
02:34:59.870 --> 02:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
the utilities are able to sweep and
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
apply to their own benefit okay so I
 
02:35:04.429 --> 02:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
want to be really clear that
 
02:35:04.439 --> 02:35:05.450 align:start position:0%
want to be really clear that
um

02:35:05.450 --> 02:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:07.309 --> 02:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
there are two different pieces to it
 
02:35:09.170 --> 02:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
okay then you had you had a comment
 
02:35:09.180 --> 02:35:10.130 align:start position:0%
okay then you had you had a comment
about

02:35:10.130 --> 02:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:35:12.410 --> 02:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
um cost shifting which
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
is not actually what's happening cost
 
02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
shifting is when other people are paying
 
02:35:19.250 --> 02:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
the bill for someone who has something
 
02:35:22.010 --> 02:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
that we consider to be new novel or in
 
02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
this case we started doing solar and
 
02:35:26.330 --> 02:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
there were questions about whether when
 
02:35:27.950 --> 02:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
people put solar on their own house is
 
02:35:29.270 --> 02:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
there cost shifting to their neighbors
 
02:35:31.429 --> 02:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
who don't have solar so I have really
 
02:35:34.790 --> 02:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
great news that we had a long-awaited
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
report from the Department of energy
 
02:35:37.790 --> 02:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
that came out about a month and a half
 
02:35:40.370 --> 02:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
ago where it was determined that in the
 
02:35:43.550 --> 02:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
absolute most conservative case this
 
02:35:46.130 --> 02:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
this study was done before the right
 
02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
rate spikes with natural gas so this is
 
02:35:52.250 --> 02:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
you know based on about 2020 cost of
 
02:35:54.170 --> 02:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
electricity in the most conservative
 
02:35:57.889 --> 02:35:57.899 align:start position:0%
case if there is cost shifting it's 1.5
 
02:36:00.290 --> 02:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
percent which is once again considered
 
02:36:03.889 --> 02:36:03.899 align:start position:0%
to be de minimis very small amount not
 
02:36:05.809 --> 02:36:05.819 align:start position:0%
something a conservative case not
 
02:36:07.130 --> 02:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
something that we need to be concerned
 
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
about when it comes to making policy for
 
02:36:13.070 --> 02:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
future Solar Development in the state so
 
02:36:15.710 --> 02:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
we have the data on that and it was a
 
02:36:17.809 --> 02:36:17.819 align:start position:0%
concern and which is why we waited to do
 
02:36:19.730 --> 02:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
major solar bills until after we got the
 
02:36:25.030 --> 02:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:29.330 --> 02:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
so my question is are rates are based on
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
or what the utilities are allowed to
 
02:36:35.330 --> 02:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
rate US at allowed against their income
 
02:36:37.910 --> 02:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
and their expenses and they have a
 
02:36:41.389 --> 02:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
bottom line so when these are swept by
 
02:36:43.250 --> 02:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
the utilities are you saying that
 
02:36:44.210 --> 02:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
02:36:48.050 --> 02:36:48.060 align:start position:0%
blended into that formula or are they do
 
02:36:50.690 --> 02:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
they uh are they applied as income for
 
02:36:54.170 --> 02:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
the utility or not is it an equal value
 
02:36:55.550 --> 02:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
or not
 
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a question for the
 
02:36:59.870 --> 02:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
utilities as to how they actually handle
 
02:37:02.570 --> 02:37:02.580 align:start position:0%
the value of the wrecks that they sweep
 
02:37:05.929 --> 02:37:05.939 align:start position:0%
but my point was there was no puc case
 
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
opened at the time that they got the
 
02:37:10.010 --> 02:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
benefit of those wrecks which would have
 
02:37:12.889 --> 02:37:12.899 align:start position:0%
meant Sixth Sense increase or I'm sorry
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
six seven decrease at the time 2013 it
 
02:37:16.969 --> 02:37:16.979 align:start position:0%
would have been meant about six cent
 
02:37:20.929 --> 02:37:20.939 align:start position:0%
decrease on average to all ratepayers so
 
02:37:23.570 --> 02:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to say that absence of
 
02:37:27.770 --> 02:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
evidence is the conclusion here but also
 
02:37:29.990 --> 02:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's a question as to how the utilities
 
02:37:33.290 --> 02:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
determine the value of avoided Rec
 
02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
purchases or alternative compliance
 
02:37:37.610 --> 02:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
payments so when you're doing your
 
02:37:39.830 --> 02:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
bookkeeping how do you put a value on
 
02:37:42.110 --> 02:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
that avoided cost I'm not sure that's
 
02:37:45.410 --> 02:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
really a utility question so if I may in
 
02:37:47.690 --> 02:37:47.700 align:start position:0%
other words the consumers not seeing any
 
02:37:51.230 --> 02:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh discernible value from the credits
 
02:37:52.730 --> 02:37:52.740 align:start position:0%
that they're sweeping the utilities
 
02:37:55.490 --> 02:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
there's there's not a tangible rate
 
02:37:58.670 --> 02:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
decrease to the consumers that where
 
02:38:02.270 --> 02:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
they would be if it was a normal income
 
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
accounted item agree yes thank you agree
 
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
I've been in business most of my life I
 
02:38:15.650 --> 02:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
kind of agree with the the chair
 
02:38:18.110 --> 02:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
representative Wyler that
 
02:38:20.809 --> 02:38:20.819 align:start position:0%
when you take when you take income away
 
02:38:22.670 --> 02:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
from a business
 
02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
they work hard to replace it and we know
 
02:38:28.010 --> 02:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
02:38:30.170 --> 02:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
that one of the things that holds us
 
02:38:32.150 --> 02:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
back and holds back the growth of
 
02:38:36.010 --> 02:38:36.020 align:start position:0%
industry is high electrical rates
 
02:38:40.070 --> 02:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
and it's a penny here and a penny there
 
02:38:42.290 --> 02:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
it's like Everett Dirksen said a
 
02:38:44.929 --> 02:38:44.939 align:start position:0%
millionaire a million there pretty soon
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about big money
 
02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:48.650 align:start position:0%
you're talking about big money
and

02:38:48.650 --> 02:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:38:51.290 --> 02:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
it's just inevitable that when you take
 
02:38:54.410 --> 02:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
something away from the utility they're
 
02:38:58.370 --> 02:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
going to figure out how to get it back
 
02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
so in response to that I would say we
 
02:39:03.050 --> 02:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
have short-term and long-term thinking
 
02:39:04.910 --> 02:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
on how the utilities manage their
 
02:39:06.650 --> 02:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
business and they are controlled you're
 
02:39:08.330 --> 02:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
absolutely right they're a monopoly and
 
02:39:10.130 --> 02:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
they have tight constraints because we
 
02:39:11.330 --> 02:39:11.340 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that they aren't
 
02:39:14.270 --> 02:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
hurting rate payers that being said when
 
02:39:17.450 --> 02:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
we're talking about six cents plus or
 
02:39:21.469 --> 02:39:21.479 align:start position:0%
minus pre-2013 post 2013. we're talking
 
02:39:23.630 --> 02:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
about Sixth Sense
 
02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
and then we're talking about the
 
02:39:27.590 --> 02:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
long-term goal of the renewable
 
02:39:29.929 --> 02:39:29.939 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard was to require
 
02:39:33.170 --> 02:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
utilities to start purchasing renewable
 
02:39:35.389 --> 02:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
energy credits and to diversify their
 
02:39:37.730 --> 02:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
mix therefore get us off of this
 
02:39:40.429 --> 02:39:40.439 align:start position:0%
International volatile rate situation so
 
02:39:43.010 --> 02:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
the long-term goal here 10 years out is
 
02:39:45.590 --> 02:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
to not be so reliant on only two major
 
02:39:47.570 --> 02:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
energy sources in New Hampshire that's
 
02:39:49.250 --> 02:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
why we set up the renewable portfolio
 
02:39:51.349 --> 02:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
standard and that's why we told the
 
02:39:52.730 --> 02:39:52.740 align:start position:0%
utilities they had to meet those
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
percentage requirements and they had you
 
02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
know the carrot and the stick the stick
 
02:39:58.490 --> 02:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
was if you don't do it you're going to
 
02:40:00.290 --> 02:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
have to buy rex or you're going to have
 
02:40:02.090 --> 02:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
to make alternative compliance payments
 
02:40:05.630 --> 02:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
so by giving them this free pass
 
02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
we went back to short-term thinking and
 
02:40:09.170 --> 02:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
we said okay now it's just about the
 
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
pennies it's just about getting by year
 
02:40:12.590 --> 02:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
to year and we're not looking at the big
 
02:40:14.510 --> 02:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
picture long-term goal which is really
 
02:40:16.190 --> 02:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
10 years from now we don't want our
 
02:40:19.429 --> 02:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
Energy Mix as a state to just be two two
 
02:40:21.230 --> 02:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
major sources we want it to be diverse
 
02:40:24.590 --> 02:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
any more questions for representative
 
02:40:30.410 --> 02:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
McWilliams seeing one represent people I
 
02:40:32.150 --> 02:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
mean isn't the concept that you just
 
02:40:34.370 --> 02:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
described that ultimately our overall
 
02:40:36.590 --> 02:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
electricity rates should be going down
 
02:40:40.090 --> 02:40:40.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:44.690 --> 02:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
expanding the pie the pie
 
02:40:46.130 --> 02:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
um I mean
 
02:40:48.889 --> 02:40:48.899 align:start position:0%
I guess again I would just ask
 
02:40:51.170 --> 02:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
this has a fiscal note I'm just not
 
02:40:53.950 --> 02:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
seeing other than the policy discussion
 
02:40:57.950 --> 02:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
what effect this has on the budget so I
 
02:41:01.309 --> 02:41:01.319 align:start position:0%
have a I have a problem
 
02:41:04.429 --> 02:41:04.439 align:start position:0%
voting on it other than the way the
 
02:41:09.410 --> 02:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:11.750 --> 02:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
I'm free we're not going to take any
 
02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
more questions on this so we're well
 
02:41:18.530 --> 02:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
past our time the policy committee what
 
02:41:20.570 --> 02:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
speaking of the policy I know was taken
 
02:41:22.550 --> 02:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
off the table last week
 
02:41:25.309 --> 02:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
was it without recommendation or was it
 
02:41:27.650 --> 02:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
itl ought to pass out of Science and
 
02:41:29.929 --> 02:41:29.939 align:start position:0%
Technology do you recall it was evenly
 
02:41:34.190 --> 02:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
split evenly split thanks you're welcome
 
02:41:36.770 --> 02:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh seeing more no more questions from
 
02:41:38.630 --> 02:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
the division
 
02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:39.650 align:start position:0%
the division
um

02:41:39.650 --> 02:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:43.490 --> 02:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
is there a motion or thought what the
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
division would like to do representative
 
02:41:48.110 --> 02:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
evil I'll just go ahead and make make a
 
02:41:50.270 --> 02:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
motion and then we can talk about it I
 
02:41:53.210 --> 02:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
think I've already expressed my concern
 
02:41:55.969 --> 02:41:55.979 align:start position:0%
that we're really focused on the policy
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
here and I think there's Divergent
 
02:42:01.370 --> 02:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
opinions but if we're here to talk about
 
02:42:03.290 --> 02:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
the effect on the budget I don't really
 
02:42:07.250 --> 02:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
see one so on that basis and adhering to
 
02:42:09.410 --> 02:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
the reason that we're here
 
02:42:12.110 --> 02:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
um the the house voted ought to pass and
 
02:42:14.809 --> 02:42:14.819 align:start position:0%
I would make a motion about to pass I
 
02:42:16.969 --> 02:42:16.979 align:start position:0%
second that motion the motion's been
 
02:42:19.010 --> 02:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
made and seconded by representative
 
02:42:22.849 --> 02:42:22.859 align:start position:0%
hatch to pass this uh
 
02:42:25.790 --> 02:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
due to its uh
 
02:42:28.610 --> 02:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
apparent lack of impact on the state's
 
02:42:32.570 --> 02:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
budget then I mean and yes I do support
 
02:42:35.210 --> 02:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
the policy but I'm what I'm really doing
 
02:42:37.910 --> 02:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
is supporting them the
 
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
um house vote in favor of this
 
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
all right is there more discussion
 
02:42:44.990 --> 02:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
representing camberells yes thank you Mr
 
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
chair well having come from sdne last
 
02:42:50.210 --> 02:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
session I'm well versed on this subject
 
02:42:52.010 --> 02:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
matter and
 
02:42:54.830 --> 02:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
um there's no doubt in my mind that
 
02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
although it may not affect the state
 
02:43:00.050 --> 02:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
budget this affects the rate payers and
 
02:43:01.790 --> 02:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
I know we're not here again not here to
 
02:43:04.010 --> 02:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
discuss policy we'll discuss uh you're
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
here to discuss the financial impact but
 
02:43:08.389 --> 02:43:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that when you impact our
 
02:43:11.330 --> 02:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
rate payers uh you're impacting the
 
02:43:16.070 --> 02:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
state and uh the again the these swept
 
02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
wrecks serve no per the people that are
 
02:43:23.450 --> 02:43:23.460 align:start position:0%
voluntarily not signed up to get credit
 
02:43:26.210 --> 02:43:26.220 align:start position:0%
for their wrecks it's just wasted it
 
02:43:29.210 --> 02:43:29.220 align:start position:0%
just just sits there I see no problem
 
02:43:31.490 --> 02:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
with the utilities sweeping them and
 
02:43:33.110 --> 02:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
then returning that back to the
 
02:43:35.809 --> 02:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
ratepayers in the form of a rebate
 
02:43:38.929 --> 02:43:38.939 align:start position:0%
whether it's six cents or six dollars
 
02:43:40.610 --> 02:43:40.620 align:start position:0%
um it there's no doubt that it goes back
 
02:43:42.490 --> 02:43:42.500 align:start position:0%
to the rape payer
 
02:43:44.450 --> 02:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:43:47.210 --> 02:43:47.220 align:start position:0%
I I would I would personally have made
 
02:43:49.670 --> 02:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
an itl motion but I know where we have
 
02:43:52.849 --> 02:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
another motion on the table right now
 
02:43:56.090 --> 02:43:56.100 align:start position:0%
represent Griffin I would second the
 
02:43:58.150 --> 02:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
comments that were just made
 
02:44:01.090 --> 02:44:01.100 align:start position:0%
inevitably it's going to affect the rate
 
02:44:04.490 --> 02:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
and that means it's going to affect the
 
02:44:04.500 --> 02:44:05.510 align:start position:0%
and that means it's going to affect the
town

02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:07.250 align:start position:0%
town
City

02:44:07.250 --> 02:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
City
 
02:44:10.190 --> 02:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
the county and the state
 
02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
and most importantly all our
 
02:44:13.560 --> 02:44:18.550 align:start position:0%
and most importantly all our
constituents

02:44:18.550 --> 02:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
maybe represent Maguire thank you well
 
02:44:24.410 --> 02:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
let me tell you the idea I came in here
 
02:44:27.170 --> 02:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
with today which is that representative
 
02:44:29.630 --> 02:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
evil is is completely correct this is it
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the budget but we
 
02:44:33.650 --> 02:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
have to pass do something with it right
 
02:44:37.429 --> 02:44:37.439 align:start position:0%
you know put in our lap so I personally
 
02:44:40.429 --> 02:44:40.439 align:start position:0%
my personal prediction is that assuming
 
02:44:43.309 --> 02:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
this Bill gets as it is to the Senate
 
02:44:44.750 --> 02:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
and or governor
 
02:44:46.670 --> 02:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the end they're not
 
02:44:49.370 --> 02:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
going to go for it okay so I had an idea
 
02:44:53.410 --> 02:44:53.420 align:start position:0%
to to change it in the following way
 
02:44:57.410 --> 02:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
instead of the swept money going to the
 
02:45:00.110 --> 02:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
rate payer or to the utility however you
 
02:45:03.170 --> 02:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
think it goes what if we send it back to
 
02:45:05.809 --> 02:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
the people being swept namely the
 
02:45:08.809 --> 02:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
generators right so if you're you know
 
02:45:10.790 --> 02:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
if you're a little piece of this money
 
02:45:13.730 --> 02:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
is ten dollars then you get the ten
 
02:45:17.090 --> 02:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
dollars okay and so
 
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
um it would still be swept so you don't
 
02:45:21.230 --> 02:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
have to bother with the paperwork but
 
02:45:23.690 --> 02:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
your utility knows who you are so why
 
02:45:27.469 --> 02:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
not send you back that value right and
 
02:45:27.479 --> 02:45:28.910 align:start position:0%
not send you back that value right and
so

02:45:28.910 --> 02:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:45:31.790 --> 02:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
um that was my idea for a change and I
 
02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:32.570 align:start position:0%
um that was my idea for a change and I
think

02:45:32.570 --> 02:45:32.580 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:45:34.250 --> 02:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:45:36.950 --> 02:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
that has a possibility of at the end of
 
02:45:39.590 --> 02:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
the day becoming law so
 
02:45:43.370 --> 02:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
but if if you know maybe that's a bill
 
02:45:45.290 --> 02:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
for next year rather than this year I
 
02:45:47.210 --> 02:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
don't know I think your latter comment
 
02:45:49.309 --> 02:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
would be correct representative required
 
02:45:53.630 --> 02:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Griffin
 
02:45:58.809 --> 02:45:58.819 align:start position:0%
I just say one thing about uh
 
02:46:02.570 --> 02:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's idea I had
 
02:46:05.450 --> 02:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
thought about the same thing why in fact
 
02:46:09.410 --> 02:46:09.420 align:start position:0%
I almost asked the person testifying why
 
02:46:11.330 --> 02:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
hasn't this bill just give it to
 
02:46:13.250 --> 02:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
everybody who's earning it
 
02:46:15.950 --> 02:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
but I think again what's going to happen
 
02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:17.030 align:start position:0%
but I think again what's going to happen
is

02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:46:18.830 --> 02:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some shifting
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some shifting of
 
02:46:22.550 --> 02:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
cost because
 
02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:24.050 align:start position:0%
cost because
the

02:46:24.050 --> 02:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:46:26.090 --> 02:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
the rate is going to go up as a result
 
02:46:29.630 --> 02:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
of that but the electric rate
 
02:46:38.330 --> 02:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:42.950 --> 02:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative evil is it not true that
 
02:46:45.290 --> 02:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
um this regardless of what we do here
 
02:46:46.910 --> 02:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to go to full finance and
 
02:46:48.650 --> 02:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
then it's going to go back to the floor
 
02:46:50.750 --> 02:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
again that's correct
 
02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
so we'll just make a recommendation one
 
02:46:55.330 --> 02:46:55.340 align:start position:0%
way or the other
 
02:46:57.889 --> 02:46:57.899 align:start position:0%
support your emotions motion and just
 
02:46:59.690 --> 02:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
let it pull yeah we could support your
 
02:47:01.610 --> 02:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
motion and let the full committee debate
 
02:47:04.610 --> 02:47:04.620 align:start position:0%
it next week or the week after
 
02:47:07.190 --> 02:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
I mean it is a philosophically pure
 
02:47:10.550 --> 02:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
emotion I would argue you are correct
 
02:47:11.690 --> 02:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:47:13.969 --> 02:47:13.979 align:start position:0%
I'm ready to call about
 
02:47:16.070 --> 02:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
the clerk is ready to call represent
 
02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:30.170 align:start position:0%
 
no

02:47:30.170 --> 02:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:30.180 --> 02:47:41.410 align:start position:0%
 
nay

02:47:41.410 --> 02:47:41.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:46.730 --> 02:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:46.740 --> 02:48:30.110 align:start position:0%
 
nay

02:48:30.110 --> 02:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.790 --> 02:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:54.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:48:54.010 --> 02:48:54.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:56.570 --> 02:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
we're going to start going over the
 
02:48:59.330 --> 02:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
budget Page by Page and line by line and
 
02:49:02.389 --> 02:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
and there's a list of things that in hb2
 
02:49:05.030 --> 02:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
that we finally have that are strictly
 
02:49:06.410 --> 02:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
in division one
 
02:49:09.650 --> 02:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
now with this news we have of not having
 
02:49:11.510 --> 02:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere near the revenue that the
 
02:49:14.590 --> 02:49:14.600 align:start position:0%
governor has projected and spent
 
02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:16.150 align:start position:0%
governor has projected and spent
and

02:49:16.150 --> 02:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:20.990 --> 02:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
our our LBA people our LBA people can
 
02:49:22.730 --> 02:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
steer you to the
 
02:49:22.740 --> 02:49:23.950 align:start position:0%
steer you to the
the

02:49:23.950 --> 02:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:49:26.150 --> 02:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
pages you'll have that you can go
 
02:49:28.010 --> 02:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
through quickly
 
02:49:32.510 --> 02:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
banking insurance no general fund yes
 
02:49:33.770 --> 02:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
they're they're going to get the money
 
02:49:35.570 --> 02:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
wherever they have to get it we don't
 
02:49:37.670 --> 02:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
have to worry about it but we want to
 
02:49:39.530 --> 02:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
concentrate on getting through those as
 
02:49:42.230 --> 02:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can and Mike will tell you
 
02:49:45.349 --> 02:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
which pages that you can do away with
 
02:49:46.670 --> 02:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
because they don't depend on general
 
02:49:53.389 --> 02:49:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:53.399 --> 02:49:54.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:49:54.830 --> 02:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:56.630 --> 02:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
get through those so you can sit down
 
02:49:57.889 --> 02:49:57.899 align:start position:0%
and see
 
02:50:00.349 --> 02:50:00.359 align:start position:0%
my estimate is we're going to have to be
 
02:50:02.450 --> 02:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
making some Cuts now I'm going to rely
 
02:50:05.929 --> 02:50:05.939 align:start position:0%
on going to division two and what I did
 
02:50:09.410 --> 02:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
see in hb2 that I liked was
 
02:50:11.690 --> 02:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
we give so much money to the education
 
02:50:14.150 --> 02:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
trust fund that now we don't know what
 
02:50:15.650 --> 02:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
to do with all that money we're going to
 
02:50:17.450 --> 02:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
use it where we used to put general fund
 
02:50:20.750 --> 02:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
into building Aid and and special ed and
 
02:50:22.010 --> 02:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
all those things they say well you can
 
02:50:24.290 --> 02:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
use that out of the education trust fund
 
02:50:26.030 --> 02:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's too much money going into the
 
02:50:27.710 --> 02:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
education trust fund that needs to go
 
02:50:30.230 --> 02:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
elsewhere where all the other demands
 
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
are so one of the things that was in
 
02:50:34.910 --> 02:50:34.920 align:start position:0%
there was the governor's taken business
 
02:50:36.770 --> 02:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax business profits tax
 
02:50:39.110 --> 02:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
where 50 of it used to go to the
 
02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
education trust fund he's changed it to
 
02:50:43.610 --> 02:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
35 percent and I think meals and rooms
 
02:50:45.650 --> 02:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
he's done the same instead of giving as
 
02:50:47.990 --> 02:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
much it's going to 35 percent we'll take
 
02:50:49.790 --> 02:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
a look at that and I know the LBA will
 
02:50:52.730 --> 02:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
will advise us what those effects will
 
02:50:55.010 --> 02:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
be we don't need as much money going to
 
02:50:57.770 --> 02:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund last last
 
02:51:00.410 --> 02:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
session we gave away 100 million it's a
 
02:51:02.330 --> 02:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
swept which none of us have yet seen on
 
02:51:04.849 --> 02:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
our property tax bills it should have
 
02:51:06.230 --> 02:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
reduced them all a couple hundred bucks
 
02:51:08.929 --> 02:51:08.939 align:start position:0%
a piece never happens as long as the
 
02:51:10.429 --> 02:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
schoolers they're spending all they can
 
02:51:13.550 --> 02:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
see in sight so
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna I'm gonna go to division two
 
02:51:17.090 --> 02:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
and try to get the education trust fund
 
02:51:20.210 --> 02:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
changed so that more money is left in
 
02:51:22.190 --> 02:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
the general fund because we need it and
 
02:51:24.650 --> 02:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
all these other things and especially if
 
02:51:26.809 --> 02:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
we're going from division to division
 
02:51:28.429 --> 02:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to have trouble balancing
 
02:51:30.230 --> 02:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
the budget they'll have more money left
 
02:51:33.010 --> 02:51:33.020 align:start position:0%
plus they don't have to worry about Dot
 
02:51:36.349 --> 02:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
and safety get they're not going to get
 
02:51:38.270 --> 02:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
money as much money from General funds
 
02:51:40.550 --> 02:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
as they might thought they were and
 
02:51:42.050 --> 02:51:42.060 align:start position:0%
they're all planning on buying more
 
02:51:44.270 --> 02:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
cruises and all this other stuff the
 
02:51:46.010 --> 02:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
money isn't there
 
02:51:48.170 --> 02:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
unless unless more money comes in the
 
02:51:49.550 --> 02:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
highway fund and as long as people keep
 
02:51:52.070 --> 02:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
buying electric cars and getting 30
 
02:51:54.469 --> 02:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
miles a gallon it's a whole other it's
 
02:51:57.650 --> 02:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
going to keep going down so is it your
 
02:52:02.349 --> 02:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
job to give us a total for our section
 
02:52:05.150 --> 02:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
yes yes with a lot of help from the
 
02:52:05.160 --> 02:52:08.389 align:start position:0%
yes yes with a lot of help from the
experts

02:52:08.389 --> 02:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:14.710 --> 02:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:17.630 --> 02:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
you know which is last time you might
 
02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
remember because some some of us were
 
02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:20.330 align:start position:0%
remember because some some of us were
here

02:52:20.330 --> 02:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:52:23.210 --> 02:52:23.220 align:start position:0%
we had to cut 70 million
 
02:52:25.370 --> 02:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
and we took a look at the fact that the
 
02:52:27.110 --> 02:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
previous budget there was a hundred
 
02:52:28.250 --> 02:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
million which should have gone for
 
02:52:31.429 --> 02:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
one-time projects but instead they put
 
02:52:34.550 --> 02:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
it all into HHS HHS couldn't hire enough
 
02:52:36.230 --> 02:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
people to find enough space to put them
 
02:52:39.469 --> 02:52:39.479 align:start position:0%
to work so that hundred million is 80
 
02:52:41.630 --> 02:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
million of it still left in HHS and
 
02:52:44.389 --> 02:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
we've got to cut 70 million there it is
 
02:52:45.590 --> 02:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
they had
 
02:52:48.349 --> 02:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
listed for 3 600 employees they had
 
02:52:48.359 --> 02:52:49.969 align:start position:0%
listed for 3 600 employees they had
2300.

02:52:49.969 --> 02:52:49.979 align:start position:0%
2300.
 
02:52:52.010 --> 02:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
once you take away all those employees
 
02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
they didn't hire
 
02:52:55.490 --> 02:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
we've balanced the budget I don't know
 
02:52:57.050 --> 02:52:57.060 align:start position:0%
as we'll have something that easy again
 
02:52:59.690 --> 02:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to be looking
 
02:53:02.030 --> 02:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
so you'll find it
 
02:53:04.429 --> 02:53:04.439 align:start position:0%
I'll do my best
 
02:53:09.050 --> 02:53:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:11.450 --> 02:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
well you you have so many different
 
02:53:14.870 --> 02:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
plots and you only have a few that have
 
02:53:17.210 --> 02:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
funded other than general fund
 
02:53:17.220 --> 02:53:18.530 align:start position:0%
funded other than general fund
yeah so

02:53:18.530 --> 02:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
02:53:25.969 --> 02:53:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:28.130 --> 02:53:28.140 align:start position:0%
well I just I haven't thought of it that
 
02:53:41.570 --> 02:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:41.580 --> 03:37:27.130 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:37:27.130 --> 03:37:27.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:29.690 --> 03:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
03:37:32.870 --> 03:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
I I move retained
 
03:37:45.710 --> 03:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:54.290 --> 03:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:59.870 --> 03:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:59.880 --> 03:38:01.490 align:start position:0%
 
technically

03:38:01.490 --> 03:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
technically
 
03:38:06.050 --> 03:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:08.389 --> 03:38:08.399 align:start position:0%
well they'll have to go be the official
 
03:38:09.830 --> 03:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
thing that was always done in the past
 
03:38:12.349 --> 03:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
that they failed to do this year was
 
03:38:14.929 --> 03:38:14.939 align:start position:0%
prior to February 15th they would come
 
03:38:17.030 --> 03:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
before the house they would make a
 
03:38:19.490 --> 03:38:19.500 align:start position:0%
presentation and they would pass a
 
03:38:22.849 --> 03:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
resolution this time it's H.R 17. okay
 
03:38:26.389 --> 03:38:26.399 align:start position:0%
that's finding upon us that's law upon
 
03:38:26.399 --> 03:38:27.050 align:start position:0%
that's finding upon us that's law upon
us

03:38:27.050 --> 03:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:38:30.110 --> 03:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
we can't go over that
 
03:38:32.210 --> 03:38:32.220 align:start position:0%
so we sit down with a budget and two
 
03:38:34.250 --> 03:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
years ago it was a 70 million dollar
 
03:38:34.260 --> 03:38:37.550 align:start position:0%
years ago it was a 70 million dollar
difference

03:38:37.550 --> 03:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:41.389 --> 03:38:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:43.550 --> 03:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's better than the 250 million I
 
03:38:46.190 --> 03:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
first looked at it yeah that would give
 
03:38:48.170 --> 03:38:48.180 align:start position:0%
you gray hair well we're talking about
 
03:38:48.180 --> 03:38:50.540 align:start position:0%
you gray hair well we're talking about
here
