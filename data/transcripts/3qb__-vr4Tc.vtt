session on HB
 
00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:34.230 align:start position:0%
session on HB
1492

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:36.919 align:start position:0%
and uh representative Aly I I assume you
 
00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:50.110 align:start position:0%
 
two

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
two yes um HB
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
1492 um thank you gets us back a lot of
 
00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:03.639 align:start position:0%
money that is it's about 6% of the
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
revenue from LA from last year from
 
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:10.840 align:start position:0%
FY uh
 
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
23 um and we really can't afford to lose
 
00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:20.039 align:start position:0%
any more Revenue uh because we're not
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
going to have uh the Surplus money
 
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
coming in from the feds anymore and
 
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
we've been spending that Surplus money
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
at a very fast rate it seems to me so
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't be available to fall
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
back on a lot of it is also going to I
 
00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
saw a graphic the other day that says
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
that of the um money from the
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
um the third stimulus package
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
on we are about a year Year from closure
 
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
of being able to use that money a third
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
of it has not been appropriated at all a
 
00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
third of it has been appropriated and
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
not been spent
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
yet so we're not doing very well on
 
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
keeping that Surplus somehow to to use
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
in in
 
00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
future uh times on the other thing that
 
00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:31.399 align:start position:0%
I think is really important is that I
 
00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
don't know yet I don't know if Keen
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
knows uh
 
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
when the
 
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh the exemptions for the interest in
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
dividends tax were last
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
changed it's more than 30 years at this
 
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
point and on the inflation has been
 
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839 align:start position:0%
quite significant since then uh we have
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of people paying who are paying
 
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
teeny amounts that give us almost no
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
money and uh um really can't afford that
 
00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:12.839 align:start position:0%
teeny amount so um the bill also triples
 
00:10:12.839 --> 00:10:13.949 align:start position:0%
teeny amount so um the bill also triples
the

00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:13.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
exemptions um to restore it to something
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
like what it was for a very long
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
time u a tax on unearned
 
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
income that
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
uh is mostly paid by extremely wealthy
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
people and Wealthy
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
businesses and um a number a fair number
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
of those wealthy people are not paying
 
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.670 align:start position:0%
of those wealthy people are not paying
any

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
other uh tax in our state except for uh
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
consumption of meals rooms and
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.670 align:start position:0%
consumption of meals rooms and
tobacco

00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
tobacco
 
00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:01.959 align:start position:0%
and buying
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
you comments questions
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
PL yes representative Aly wasn't here
 
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.200 align:start position:0%
yesterday when I uh discussed the omnus
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
tax cut Bill and said this is not the
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
year to discuss any tax cuts so should
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
be done during a budget year we brought
 
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
a $100 million in Surplus but that could
 
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
disappear in a hurry uh and the quidd
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
proquo in my mind was we don't talk
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
about tax increases either and and uh so
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
maybe all of this could be deferred till
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
next year and uh we we the other point
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
arguing politely against you
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative Aly is that we say we're
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
an income tax free and that's clearly an
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:11:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
elderly

00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
elderly
 
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
represent elme yes uh it is a tax on
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
unearned income at the risk of
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
encouraging some
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
Republicans uh to do something about it
 
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
we have a capital gains tax inside the
 
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
BPT and we have a Earned Income Tax in
 
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.150 align:start position:0%
BPT and we have a Earned Income Tax in
the

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
bet they're just a little bit more in
 
00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:33.750 align:start position:0%
bet they're just a little bit more in
direct

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
direct
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
indirect but there is a reason that
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
um a lot of states and uh the country
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
went to an income tax in the early 20th
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
century which is still um in effect that
 
00:12:52.829 --> 00:12:52.839 align:start position:0%
it is pretty
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
impossible to run a modern government
 
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
with the services that are most of our
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
population insists we need to
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
have without something like that and
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
was the interest in dividends tax and
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
the BET and the
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
um they are perhaps less efficient at
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
um discriminating how much uh each
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
person can afford to pay which is what
 
00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
is in the
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh that those all of us who
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
can afford to pay something should be
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
paying something and all of us who can
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
afford to pay more should be paying more
 
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
burden uh
 
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.949 align:start position:0%
burden uh
so

00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:55.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
um we depend a great deal in this this
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
state as do other states uh
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
on the labor from people who are towards
 
00:14:11.749 --> 00:14:11.759 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the income scale and the
 
00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:13.829 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the income scale and the
more

00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:14:17.749 --> 00:14:17.759 align:start position:0%
we keep them
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
from Health Access the more we keep them
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
from Child Care access or we keep them
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
from housing
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
access uh the less of them we're going
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
to have in this state to keep
 
00:14:34.399 --> 00:14:37.230 align:start position:0%
to have in this state to keep
our

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
um our state as healthy and as beautiful
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
so comments questions
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative spillsbury
 
00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:57.160 align:start position:0%
yes excuse me thank you Mr chairman now
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
preface my comment by saying I do not
 
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
pay the interest in dividends tax but I
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
think one of its flaws and it becomes
 
00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
accentuated when you raise the
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
minimum is that it rests on a very small
 
00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:14.839 align:start position:0%
percentage of our
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
population and so much so as you narrow
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
that pool that I think it even raises
 
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues of uh being
 
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.590 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues of uh being
equitably

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:31.959 align:start position:0%
applied representative Aly thank you um
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
this is something I've been looking at
 
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:36.920 align:start position:0%
very carefully with the business taxes
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
too as we rais the exemptions that they
 
00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:43.150 align:start position:0%
too as we rais the exemptions that they
not

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
become a larger part of the tax taxing
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
population taxed population than um they
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
were over the long term
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
before and actually when this tax was
 
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
created it was a wealth
 
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
tax that the state put in because it was
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
on interest and from
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
banking from your bank
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
accounts and very few people in
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
accounts so it was pretty it was pretty
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
much a wealth tax and it has migrated
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:34.759 align:start position:0%
to the range of investment results that
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
people have and the range of of
 
00:16:43.949 --> 00:16:43.959 align:start position:0%
uh um people that were paying it and
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
when we do
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
not move with inflation on
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
exemptions and I'm one of the ones
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for not moving over the last
 
00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
25 years uh
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
because the then head of Dr told us that
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh half of the money was coming from
 
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:13.720 align:start position:0%
poor elderly people so we were afraid to
 
00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:14.669 align:start position:0%
poor elderly people so we were afraid to
do

00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
anything to the tax uh as we know now
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
that is not true we have the
 
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.789 align:start position:0%
that is not true we have the
triangles

00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
triangles
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
um but as we
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
if we when we do not move with
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
inflation we are
 
00:17:34.919 --> 00:17:38.750 align:start position:0%
inflation we are
taxing

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh less uh more people than we were
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
taxing before we are bringing bringing
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
the the tax down to levels where people
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
really can't afford it by the way I do
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
tax

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative Southworth uh
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I do think this is
 
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
a reasonable way to uh collect Revenue I
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
have paid it a couple of times and my
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
mom pays it I think you need to
 
00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
contribute to your state for all the
 
00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
different services and things that a
 
00:18:20.909 --> 00:18:20.919 align:start position:0%
state needs um to succeed and do well in
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
the future I think for someone with a
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
100,000 in interest and dividends which
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
probably is a multi-million
 
00:18:32.909 --> 00:18:32.919 align:start position:0%
um 4,000 to the state is not um
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
unreasonable and I think for a
 
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
billionaire to pay 40,000 to the state
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
uh again uh it's not an unreasonable
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
opinion uh representative ORS thank you
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so uh just a couple thoughts
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
one you mentioned the tax uh that
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
started in the early 20th century that
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
originally was set at I think 34,000 and
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
and my concern is what we've seen in
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
history is that that 34,000 where the
 
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
tax started to avoid the poor paying tax
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
eventually came down to where everybody
 
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
paid the
 
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
tax and with the in and D tax I don't
 
00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.870 align:start position:0%
tax and with the in and D tax I don't
know

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
that if we eliminate it would we bring
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
big money people into the state to
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
invest maybe maybe not uh but one thing
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
one thing for sure and you said it is
 
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
that if if it were to stay I think the
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
bar should be raised so as Tom said it's
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
high enough so that people that aren't
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
millionaires or billionaires aren't
 
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
tax yes representa
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate all the
 
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
comments that have been made um
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury
 
00:20:06.549 --> 00:20:06.559 align:start position:0%
raised the question of inequity and I
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
feel I'm 49 I think I'm by far the
 
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.230 align:start position:0%
feel I'm 49 I think I'm by far the
second

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
youngest um at the table so I've grown
 
00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:17.559 align:start position:0%
up in an economy that is different um
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
than people who are you know 20 or 30
 
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
years older than me so the economy that
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
I'm living in and that I've been working
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
in and trying to raise money in is
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
different than
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
that of people who are now in
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
retirement and so I think that we need
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
to think about the generations who are
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
not maybe represented at this table and
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
when we talk about
 
00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
inequity it I think we've we've gone so
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
far that now we're wondering if we're
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
inequitably taxing the rich and the
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
reason that there's so much wealthier is
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
because of inequity so I feel like we're
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're like we've created this huge gap
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
between the and have not and then we're
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
asking ourselves if it's fair to tax the
 
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:05.559 align:start position:0%
rich so we've gone to this point where
 
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's a bit illogical so yes wealthy
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
people should pay taxes I don't think
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
that they should not have to pay taxes I
 
00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:17.590 align:start position:0%
that they should not have to pay taxes I
pay

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
taxes uh so if people want to move to
 
00:21:20.159 --> 00:21:21.190 align:start position:0%
taxes uh so if people want to move to
the

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
state they should assume they have to
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
pay taxes otherwise it's just a race to
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
the bottom right and I feel like we're
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
doing that internationally we're doing
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
it state to state people have to pay
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
taxes otherwise we have no State
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
services and I hear um friends and
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
neighbors complain because they can't
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
hire a carpenter right and it's like
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
well we need to have policies in the
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
state where families can't afford to
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
live here and we should legislate for
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
families who live in New
 
00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and not just for rich people
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
that we hope one day will move to New
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of our policies so I
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
hope that we will consider not only rich
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
people we would like to invite to move
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire but the families that
 
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
live here now and frankly that every
 
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
year if they have the means ask
 
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
themselves like my family does can we
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
stay here or does is this state telling
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
us to move away cuz when we cut taxes on
 
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:31.720 align:start position:0%
indd and there is no relief in sight for
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers it is the message
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
seems crystal clear to me who do we want
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
to invite to our state I understand it
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
would be great to have a bunch of rich
 
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
people live here but they're not going
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
to be your Carpenters right they're not
 
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
going to be your nurses they're not
 
00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
going to be your caretakers as we
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
continue to get older in the state we're
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
going to need more of those workers so I
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
hope that we will think about ways to
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
make everyone pay their Fair share
 
00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
because I feel like this bill is not
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
responding to why our constituents sent
 
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
us here they want everyone to contribute
 
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
their fair share and this is frankly I
 
00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
feel like it's asking the wealthy to
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
contribute too little frankly thank
 
00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
you yes represent elberger thank you Mr
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
chairman I would like to agree with my
 
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
colleague from namester despite the fact
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm the generation above you
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh the percentage of taxes that the
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
wealthy have paid has dropped hugely for
 
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.039 align:start position:0%
the last 100 years or so uh I represent
 
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
nasua we I have spoken to people who are
 
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
leaving the state because they can't
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
afford to live here the people that we
 
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
want to do our Lawns to be the
 
00:23:56.909 --> 00:23:56.919 align:start position:0%
caregivers to be the weight staff in
 
00:23:59.549 --> 00:23:59.559 align:start position:0%
restaurants to be our mechanics they
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
can't afford to live here and if the
 
00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:05.919 align:start position:0%
services that we provide diminish and
 
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
the tax burden falls disproportionately
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
on them which I believe it does then we
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
can have all our
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
wealthy in
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
migrants but there's not going to be
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
anybody to help take care of them I a
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
society needs to have a broad range of
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
people in it to function well that's
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
genders that's ethnicities that's
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
religions all of those bits and economic
 
00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:38.919 align:start position:0%
status and if we are catering only to
 
00:24:41.909 --> 00:24:41.919 align:start position:0%
the wealthy then we're not going to
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
state representative Aly yeah just one
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
more thing about these investors moving
 
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
in investors move in with investment
 
00:24:59.470 --> 00:24:59.480 align:start position:0%
portfolios that uh are are very widely
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
based usually
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
across um locations across uh
 
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
regions uh cross
 
00:25:12.389 --> 00:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
countries and
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
um the when you're moving in I
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
spent um about eight years while both my
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
both of my parents were were still able
 
00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh and an all Rich old folks home in
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
north of of hover uh that
 
00:25:39.149 --> 00:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
contained uh and eating dinner with
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
quite a few people that had moved into
 
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.230 align:start position:0%
quite a few people that had moved into
the

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.789 align:start position:0%
the
state

00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
and none of them were setting up new
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
firms or setting up new firms or
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
investing in something local in
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
particular they are coming coming in
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
because and one of them actually um was
 
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
surprised at dinner when I pointed out
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
that we had a 5% income tax interest and
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
dividends tax that is and she hadn't
 
00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:16.360 align:start position:0%
heard about that yet because they hadn't
 
00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
been didn't have a program at that point
 
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
to tell people moving in by the
 
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
way but
 
00:26:30.029 --> 00:26:30.039 align:start position:0%
on I don't believe that that um this is
 
00:26:33.549 --> 00:26:33.559 align:start position:0%
really an important impact because there
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
are a lot of places around us that
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
have higher tax loads than we do and
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
charge them to the upper class as well
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
as everybody else um and
 
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.510 align:start position:0%
as everybody else um and
they

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
um Bill
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
hatch informed me of of this he was on
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
finance until recently uh but he used to
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh put to put C curtains and rugs and
 
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
carpets uh and uh other things into um
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
major houses and major um hotels in the
 
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:22.789 align:start position:0%
major houses and major um hotels in the
North

00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
North
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
country and he had clients that built uh
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
homes in the unincorporated territories
 
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
where there was no tax of any kind going
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
going on on that lived in New York
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
City and they came once a year to New
 
00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to say here I am and they said
 
00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:46.519 align:start position:0%
they were citizens of New Hampshire to
 
00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:47.389 align:start position:0%
they were citizens of New Hampshire to
New

00:27:47.389 --> 00:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
York and paid our uh interest in
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
dividends tax he was a little worried
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
that the interest in dividends tax would
 
00:27:57.039 --> 00:28:00.110 align:start position:0%
that the interest in dividends tax would
uh

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
would uh go down if this scam was
 
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:09.640 align:start position:0%
discovered he didn't have any strong
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
evidence of this by the way but this was
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
not what he was thinking um but they
 
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
were happy to come to New Hampshire for
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
one day a year they weren't investing
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
anything except you were paying for our
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
yes um representative Malloy thank you
 
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.269 align:start position:0%
yes um representative Malloy thank you
Mr

00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
chairman this just occurred to me as I'm
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
today uh I moved here from Iowa 20 some
 
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.350 align:start position:0%
today uh I moved here from Iowa 20 some
years

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:44.360 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
ago and then that
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
state obviously paid a federal income
 
00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:54.919 align:start position:0%
tax we also paid a state income tax and
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
property taxes and sales taxes I moved
 
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
out here and I thought how do we run
 
00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.870 align:start position:0%
out here and I thought how do we run
this

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
Iowa the first form we filled out was
 
00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:12.799 align:start position:0%
our state income tax form that was more
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
complicated and with that state income
 
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:18.039 align:start position:0%
tax form the result of that you could
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
deduct that state your state income
 
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
taxes off the
 
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:25.720 align:start position:0%
fit uh I don't know if that's we've
 
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
talked about that even discuss that or
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
see an option here to um do something
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
like that to if somebody's paying an
 
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax is there a way
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
to deduct that from the uh your federal
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
your federal
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
form thank
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
Ames well um I'm glad we're having this
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
discussion um my
 
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
of of um New Hampshire's tax
 
00:30:13.389 --> 00:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
system is first that it has historically
 
00:30:13.399 --> 00:30:15.430 align:start position:0%
system is first that it has historically
been

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.669 align:start position:0%
been
um

00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
reliable because it has had it has drawn
 
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
from many different tax revenue sources
 
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
not just taxes uh Lottery and uh liquor
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
are examples of how it's uh um how the
 
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:36.559 align:start position:0%
bucket is filled up is not just taxes
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
but uh that diversity of uh source of
 
00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue has been a strength of New
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so Point number one is taking
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
away a major Revenue Source um
 
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
weakens the state's ability to weather
 
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
the various storms that
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
come our way um so I think it's a
 
00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:05.799 align:start position:0%
serious mistake to undo this tax and I
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
should have said that I do pay indd tax
 
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
or at least have until this change goes
 
00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
through I'm one of the small taxpayers
 
00:31:21.629 --> 00:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
that would benefit from this um I'm I'm
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
getting I well I'll say it I'm
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
old um I'm not just getting old but I'm
 
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.430 align:start position:0%
old um I'm not just getting old but I'm
old

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
old
 
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
and U and thus uh certainly more on the
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
fixed income side than anything else and
 
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
so um this uh uh tax is relevant to my
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
situation um but uh I believe in it I
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
believe that we all should pay according
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
to our ability that's in the
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution um we also should have a
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
tax structure that's reasonable and
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
proportional that too is in the
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution and as we uh peel away
 
00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
taxes that reach those at the upper end
 
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
of uh both wealth and
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
income um we
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
um we peel away
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
our adherence to that concept of
 
00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable and proportional when we look
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
at the whole and I think we should start
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the whole is this whole thing
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
reasonable and proportional and if you
 
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
do do that then we've got many studies
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
that say no no the whole is not
 
00:32:40.269 --> 00:32:40.279 align:start position:0%
reasonable and proportional it's far
 
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
from it in fact we are one of the um
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
most regressive states in the country on
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh how we on the results of our various
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
taxes and their impact on people the uh
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
it is the
 
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
people at the lowest end that are paying
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
the highest proportion of
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
their income and it's the people at the
 
00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:09.559 align:start position:0%
well it's really resources and income
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
property tax is part of that and uh then
 
00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
it's the people at the highest end who
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
are paying the lowest proportion so it's
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
exactly opposite of where we ought to be
 
00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
but um and taking away this tax just
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
undermines that um so I I wel welcome
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative aly's effort to
 
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
resurrect this tax in a better form with
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
increased exemptions making it uh
 
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.430 align:start position:0%
increased exemptions making it uh
more

00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.710 align:start position:0%
more
um

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
more responsive to the situation of the
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
lowincome low interest and dividend
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
income um
 
00:33:58.629 --> 00:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and so I I wish we could go
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
forward with this I'm a realist and uh I
 
00:34:05.629 --> 00:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
I know that uh there are various
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
barriers to that so if uh if we can't go
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
forward with it I deeply regret that uh
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
we can't as a legislature or as a
 
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
committee um reach a consensus to go
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
forward I can understand the argument
 
00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.430 align:start position:0%
forward I can understand the argument
representative

00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
flet has made PL sorry has made um
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
and uh that uh this is not a tax year
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
I've made that argument myself in other
 
00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
contexts and uh and maybe that's what we
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
have to do it just means uh uh kicking
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
the can down the road and and and
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
placing the state in a situation which
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
in which it will be very vulnerable to
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
abrupt changes or unexpected changes in
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
the state or national
 
00:34:55.879 --> 00:35:00.030 align:start position:0%
the state or national
economy

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.829 --> 00:35:02.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um anybody yes
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
represent elberger one more quick piece
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
of information as we talk about low
 
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
taxes here people generally avoid adding
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
property taxes into the tax burden so I
 
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
did my totally unscientific research
 
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
just now um house that I lived in in L
 
00:35:23.069 --> 00:35:23.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is currently valued at
 
00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:24.589 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is currently valued at
$7,000

00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:24.599 align:start position:0%
$7,000
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
$700,000 and the taxes are $4,000
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
a year my house in nashwa is uh
 
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
currently valued at about
 
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
5.7 five
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
$570,000 and the taxes are
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
8.2 $8,200 so more than twice the taxes
 
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
on my current house which is about
 
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:53.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh 20% lower in
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
value I mean to that point it is true
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has High property
 
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
taxes however the to study after study
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
the total tax burden were one of the
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
lowest tax burden States um we can
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
certainly we certainly have
 
00:36:08.309 --> 00:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
disagreements on how that tax burden
 
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
should be distributed but in in general
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't dispute your numbers
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
but I think in general um you look at
 
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
study after study New Hampshire is one
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
of the lowest tax burden States and and
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
that may be the point is that the
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
property tax is a regressive tax it is
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
flat rate regard regard less of your
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
income and folks who are not living in
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
large houses and not making a lot of
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
money are paying the same rate on their
 
00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
salaries uh represent erery thank you Mr
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
chair and to the comment that was just
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
made um yes it's a flat rate our
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
constitution calls for an equitable and
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
proportional which means that everyone
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
pays at the same rate within the same
 
00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
class if you're a property owner you pay
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
the same rate across the board within
 
00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
your class of property be it a um single
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
family or a multiple family or
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
commercial property depending upon how
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
that goes
 
00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
which to address the issue of being
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
regressive a property tax is the only
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
tax that every person in the state pays
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
whether you're a property owner or
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
you're a
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
rental you were paying into that
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
property tax B it burden it is the only
 
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
tax that everybody participates
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
in which makes it one of the most
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
egalitarian taxing
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
systems ever devised because everyone
 
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
happens to that I would comment that
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
taking from some to give to others
 
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
sounds suspiciously like uh a 19th
 
00:37:56.119 --> 00:37:57.270 align:start position:0%
sounds suspiciously like uh a 19th
century

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
century
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
German uh economic theorist that has
 
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
be more damaging to people of lower
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
circumstance uh Revenue circumstance
 
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
than to people of higher circumstance
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
and to penalize someone for being
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
successful is
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
not a policy which in governmental
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
entity should engage in which any
 
00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.160 align:start position:0%
governmental agency should
 
00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
engage all that does is suggest to
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
successful or
 
00:38:48.630 --> 00:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
cheat so I would suggest
 
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.270 align:start position:0%
cheat so I would suggest
that

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
reinstituting the indd tax which is a
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
passive tax based upon wealth that's
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
already been taxed and set aside
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
into um a Development Fund is a form of
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
double taxation because it's money
 
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's profit it's already been paid
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
you've already paid a tax on it and now
 
00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
you're being paid a tax
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
on the work that that money is being is
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
doing and when it's put into an
 
00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:21.710 align:start position:0%
doing and when it's put into an
investment

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
investment
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
account to earn extra dividends or
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
interest it's actually being used by
 
00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
either a bank in the case of Interest or
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
in the dividends by an investment firm
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
to create jobs and business
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities and to fund uh
 
00:39:42.510 --> 00:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
developmental projects elsewhere
 
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
so it just seems to
 
00:39:50.309 --> 00:39:50.319 align:start position:0%
me that of the regressive taxes talked
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
about this is part the indd is
 
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps worse than
 
00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.150 align:start position:0%
perhaps worse than
most

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:01.720 align:start position:0%
others thank you Mr
 
00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
chair okay before we go down a hole of
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
too much um
 
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:11.960 align:start position:0%
uh partisan Theory and and eat up too
 
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
much time I just want to um we can I
 
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
mean I'll take a couple more comments
 
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
but uh I you know we we've got to be
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
efficient with this discussion um I
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
think to representative pl's point in
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
the beginning um you know we have had a
 
00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
bunch of changes over the past year um
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
and it may be time to let things settle
 
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to um you know M making
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
any new changes I think on as he pointed
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
out on the tax uh side um you know we're
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
we're kind of trying to let things
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
settle see how things go and this may be
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
another one in a non-budget year um to
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
to do the same so with that that last
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
comment I'll I'll take for the chair
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
just point of order yeah um are we
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
thinking um these may go to interim
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
study as an
 
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
option it's it's a possible option it
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
just seems like when we're this far
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
apart um that that might be a good
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
solution for both types of bills so
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
because we could do this discussion
 
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
really a long long time right so I just
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
want make sure cuz it hadn't really been
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned what we were going to vote on
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
but you know that seems to be a nice
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
Middle Ground between OTP and itl the
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
interim study it also would give us time
 
00:41:34.349 --> 00:41:34.359 align:start position:0%
to see what's going on around us and I
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
with these different lawsuits and so on
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
right I just a thought I just wasn't
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
clear so that's thank you for thank you
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
for bringing that up I I'm not going to
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
commit to that right this minute because
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
the coxes have to meet um during our uh
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
at lunchtime we'll have a little bit
 
00:41:51.069 --> 00:41:51.079 align:start position:0%
longer lunch so that you can have lunch
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
and and caucus and uh but I think that's
 
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
something that could be on the table
 
00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:57.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for that comment comment yes
 
00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.910 align:start position:0%
thank you for that comment comment yes
representative

00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
lley thank you Mr chair I appreciate the
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
efforts to slow down too much change at
 
00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
once just want to make a comment that
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
the change has been in One Direction um
 
00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
that what we have the work that we have
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
done uh as a house has been in the
 
00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
direction of cutting taxes in
 
00:42:23.589 --> 00:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
unpredictable and I would dare say
 
00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:26.559 align:start position:0%
drastic and across the across the board
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
ways right it's not just indd tax that's
 
00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
been cut um so I would say that if if
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
we're arguing for a middle ground um
 
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
let's be honest with what is middle and
 
00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
what is going in One Direction so I feel
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
like the proposal on the table is
 
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
actually to
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
moderate um some of the changes that
 
00:42:50.549 --> 00:42:50.559 align:start position:0%
have been made so I just want to remind
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
us you know to kind of when people are
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
um speaking from ideology and not from
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
math that there is a mathematical middle
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
ground that exists that we can all look
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
at the math and see okay we've cut this
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
much tax we can predict that you know
 
00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:14.319 align:start position:0%
this has been the change so let's just
 
00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
keep in mind what is what moderate or
 
00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
what middle of the road is thank
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
you representative fellows just one
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
really small comment on a little just
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
one little section of it is when there
 
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
were discussions about repealing the
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax one of the
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
arguments made was that seniors living
 
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
on a fixed income and a little bit of uh
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
money from dividends and interest were
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
impacted but this bill while it's
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
probably 95% the same as the old
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax this one has
 
00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
much higher thresholds so I believe the
 
00:43:59.069 --> 00:43:59.079 align:start position:0%
threshold here is um
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
7,500 but for seniors it could be um um
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
whatever 50% more than that is and I
 
00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:11.240 align:start position:0%
believe correct me if I'm wrong that um
 
00:44:13.549 --> 00:44:13.559 align:start position:0%
the in interest in dividends tax Port
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
the threshold was 2,000
 
00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
2400 thank
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
you okay um unless someone has some burn
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
um okay represent Aly will yeah I just
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to do a little history lesson uh
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
before my time on before World War II uh
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
the state was having great difficulty
 
00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
figuring out how to fund the
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
basic uh necessities of government and
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
depending uh quite heavily I don't think
 
00:44:51.309 --> 00:44:51.319 align:start position:0%
any more heavily than we are now frankly
 
00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
uh on a property tax because that was
 
00:44:57.549 --> 00:44:57.559 align:start position:0%
what the people who set up the
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution did but in their case the
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
property tax was a tax on productive
 
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
property it was not a tax on
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
unproductive property which included
 
00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.470 align:start position:0%
unproductive property which included
people's

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
people's
 
00:45:13.549 --> 00:45:13.559 align:start position:0%
residences um and I'm not sure when it
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
got transferred over but um what the
 
00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court did was to take apart the
 
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
Constitutional requirement that
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
everything be reasonable not Equitable
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable and
 
00:45:35.069 --> 00:45:35.079 align:start position:0%
proportional uh on in addressing the
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
burden taxable tax burden of the
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
individuals and SE and say that we could
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
apply that to
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
entities and apply that to
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh to uh different
 
00:46:04.549 --> 00:46:04.559 align:start position:0%
kinds of of uh tax Target so we had we
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
got at that point we only had for this
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
we only had the road toll and it's
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
called a road toll because it couldn't
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
be a tax um they ruled that we could
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
have the tobacco tax they ruled that we
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
could have the um the interest in
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
dividends tax was was already there but
 
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
it was is about the only one I believe
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
on repres representative Aly um I
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the work that you've done on
 
00:46:34.829 --> 00:46:34.839 align:start position:0%
this bill I know you did a lot of work
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of detail here but but I
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
don't think at this hour right now
 
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:41.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to I appreciate what you're
 
00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:44.839 align:start position:0%
trying to do um but I I want to end this
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh work session could I just finish that
 
00:46:48.549 --> 00:46:48.559 align:start position:0%
sentence could you you can finish the
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
sentence thank you on they separated out
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
a general Tech General taxes to specific
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
things that we were consuming and
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
specific things that uh that we owned
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
and in doing that they created an
 
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.030 align:start position:0%
and in doing that they created an
unequal

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
unequal
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
burden across our
 
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
state and um it was necessary to keep
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
things going but uh that's how we got
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
where we are Mr chair could I have 20
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
seconds I would just like like to say
 
00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
that I like Tom's idea about an interim
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
study we got taxes coming down here
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
taxes wanted to
 
00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
stay leave it all alone for now approach
 
00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
it all next year put it all in interim
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
study and let's see how it plays out
 
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you okay I'm going to
 
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
1492 okay we'll open up on HB 1563
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
relative to the education property tax
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
subdivisions yes representative um
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
Ames and this one I I wonder if we could
 
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
set this aside and and uh I think more
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
work is being done on this uh by the
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative uh fellows
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
and um uh so the work to be done and
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
we'll be better off uh hearing a
 
00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:33.400 align:start position:0%
discussion of it once that work is done
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
and that uh would lead us I think to uh
 
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
a U coming together and and uh talking
 
00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
through this bill working on this bill
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
um as soon as can be done but probably
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh the mon the Tuesday or Wednesday
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
after this coming week something like
 
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
that so that's my request defer s now
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
next week have a work session on it we
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
could do that you'd be ready wouldn't
 
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
you yeah represented fellows um yes that
 
00:49:05.309 --> 00:49:05.319 align:start position:0%
that would be useful it would uh give me
 
00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:09.200 align:start position:0%
more time um Dr wanted some really
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
technical details about how to implement
 
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
some of it and I uh have drafted
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
something but they'd like to move the
 
00:49:20.829 --> 00:49:20.839 align:start position:0%
words to a different line and I think it
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
would also be an opportunity to get um
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
mark galello from the Department of
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
Education who does the adequacy Aid
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
distribution because when you when you
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
look at this bill it you know the it
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
repeals the Statewide property tax way
 
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
down at the end of the bill the
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
beginning of it reads like like a school
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
funding bill so I think that that would
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
give people the opportunity to ask
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
questions about how how this interfaces
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.789 align:start position:0%
 
funding

00:49:56.789 --> 00:49:56.799 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury did you want
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
to yeah I would uh concur um even
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
without the further work that may be
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
done on the
 
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:10.400 align:start position:0%
drafting uh we have two bills here 1514
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
coming up next education committee has a
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
couple of bills uh they will have
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
executive session on February
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
14th and those bills will hit the house
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
floor on February 22nd
 
00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:28.799 align:start position:0%
since these uh bills aren't under a
 
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
deadline until uh
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
mid-march I think we should take our
 
00:50:34.829 --> 00:50:34.839 align:start position:0%
time and at least understand where the
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
education committee is before we really
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
dig into these two bills very
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
hard okay so pushing this off to next
 
00:50:45.549 --> 00:50:45.559 align:start position:0%
week is too soon then I I think next I
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
would suggest that we revisit doesn't
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
mean we can't work on it progressively
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
but I would say we not attempt a
 
00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:56.799 align:start position:0%
decision or an outcome on till after the
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
house has seen the education committee
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
all right then we will do a another work
 
00:51:35.470 --> 00:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.589 --> 00:51:38.599 align:start position:0%
63 yes you you haven't called this bill
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
but there's a second swep bill on our
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
list here and I would say what has just
 
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
been said applies to it as well it's
 
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:47.960 align:start position:0%
it's uh Senate it's representative
 
00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.190 align:start position:0%
it's uh Senate it's representative
Bickford's

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
Bickford's
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
bill um 154 I
 
00:51:57.069 --> 00:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
think oh I'm sorry did you mention
 
00:51:59.470 --> 00:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
that uh I no I was going to open that as
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
a separate the same same idea okay if
 
00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing else then we'll close uh
 
00:52:10.789 --> 00:52:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.799 --> 00:52:12.630 align:start position:0%
 
1563

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
1563
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay I didn't expect to move through
 
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:18.559 align:start position:0%
that that quickly so um now we just now
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
we just well I don't know if we caught
 
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
up or not we good um okay we'll open the
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh work session
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
hb514 representative PL I think this
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
bill has Merit because uh I'm I'm not
 
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
sure that our current method of letting
 
00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:38.870 align:start position:0%
sure that our current method of letting
people

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
keep excess over o o over their
 
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
education needs is entirely
 
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional but uh in the light of
 
00:52:51.549 --> 00:52:51.559 align:start position:0%
the fact that there is a committee to to
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
look at education funding in Toto wonder
 
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
what whether this could be pushed off uh
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
interim studied or something until until
 
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
such time that the committee comes back
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation makes sense uh represent
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah representative SP spillsbury
 
00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
would make the same point the uh of the
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
bills that uh that he spoke of that are
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
in education one is a bill that takes us
 
00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:26.799 align:start position:0%
does the same thing as the title of this
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
bill says this bill does um it moves
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
excess funds excess
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
swept it moves excess swept um
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
to um the uh
 
00:53:44.829 --> 00:53:44.839 align:start position:0%
State uh education trust fund uh both
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
bills do that so I again the argument is
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
the point is that we should defer and
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
hold back um as we um
 
00:53:58.349 --> 00:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
um I think more or less agreed to but it
 
00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:00.799 align:start position:0%
was it's just a work session on the
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
previous Bill
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
1563 representative spillsbury do you
 
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
agree that we should hold this uh the
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
same amount of time as uh 1563 yes very
 
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:13.240 align:start position:0%
much for the same reasons and in
 
00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
sequence with the education committee's
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
work in mind if I could i' just very
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
briefly add um I am persuaded personally
 
00:54:25.789 --> 00:54:25.799 align:start position:0%
that the Constitutional issue issue is
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
genuine I do believe that as to that
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
particular claim uh that the uh trial
 
00:54:35.789 --> 00:54:35.799 align:start position:0%
Court's uh Position will probably be
 
00:54:37.789 --> 00:54:37.799 align:start position:0%
sustained by the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
Court um so I think that uh there's an
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
obligation that's facing us whether it's
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
this year or next year we may want we
 
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
may want to wait for the New Hampshire
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to opine but I do think
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to do something about this
 
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm a co-sponsor on
 
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
1686 which is March Smith's bill before
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
the education committee and it does the
 
00:55:05.349 --> 00:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
same thing here with the excess swept
 
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
but in a different way actually like
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford's bill it's very
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
clean simple straightforward so that's
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
as much as we need to say now I I I
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
think what I'm trying to
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
broadcast is that after February 22nd we
 
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:23.240 align:start position:0%
have a genuine work session to wrestle
 
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:25.720 align:start position:0%
with what we need to do and not just be
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
sort of you know um pushing it off and
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
how sure are you that those uh other
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
education bills are taken up on the 22nd
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
is that pretty Stone I would hesitate to
 
00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:40.119 align:start position:0%
to have they were on the docket for
 
00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
tomorrow they've been postponed they are
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
second committee bills so they must meet
 
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
the deadline for the 22nd so that will
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
happen on the 14th uh the question that
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
I can't answer is uh whether six whether
 
00:55:57.309 --> 00:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
the the education committee um will
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
reach a OTP an itl or interim study
 
00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
conclusion and that's part of what we
 
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:05.240 align:start position:0%
need to wait and find out oh that's fine
 
00:56:07.029 --> 00:56:07.039 align:start position:0%
I I don't yeah we're not worried about
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
what that is I just just that they've
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
taken them up so that if we have a work
 
00:56:12.349 --> 00:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
session there's something there's
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
something those are on deadline to hit
 
00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
the floor the 22nd okay good so we'll
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
we'll schedule I'll schedule work
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
session for 1563 and 1514 after February
 
00:56:25.029 --> 00:56:25.039 align:start position:0%
22nd yes representa Ames yeah I just i'
 
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
like to add one other point I I agree
 
00:56:31.789 --> 00:56:31.799 align:start position:0%
that with representative
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
spilsbury's uh belief that this is uh
 
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
the swept law is likely to be found with
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
its allowance for the retention of
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
revenues of of excess revenues uh to be
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
when they reach this and that's my my
 
00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
point is it's just something to think of
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
about it is quite possible that the
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court will reach this
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
issue um in the
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
fall it may be later than that but if
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
they reach this issue they could uh and
 
00:57:12.549 --> 00:57:12.559 align:start position:0%
if they are wise like representative
 
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
spillsbury and me and agree with us
 
00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:18.190 align:start position:0%
spillsbury and me and agree with us
um

00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:18.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
then um they could issue an order and
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
unlike school
 
00:57:23.799 --> 00:57:25.309 align:start position:0%
unlike school
funding

00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
they the order in a in in this kind of
 
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
situation which concerns a tax that is
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
found to be
 
00:57:36.589 --> 00:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional they can simply order
 
00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
that the tax not be collected it's uh
 
00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
it's very straightforward they issue an
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
injunction uh in joining the uh Dr
 
00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:51.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner from um issuing the
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
warrant uh so we could all of a sudden
 
00:57:56.069 --> 00:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
find ourselves in a in
 
00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
a in a uh crisis and um um I hope that
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
won't happen I wanted people be aware of
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
that possibility and um in spite of that
 
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
we might decide that it's better you
 
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
know we through this process we've just
 
00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:15.039 align:start position:0%
been talking about going through might
 
00:58:17.029 --> 00:58:17.039 align:start position:0%
decide that still there are too many
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
questions and the whole thing needs to
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
be resolved at once school funding and
 
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:24.920 align:start position:0%
excess swept and all that um and we're
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
going to delay even though there is that
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
danger that
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
will be up against it because of action
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme Court on exus we so I
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
just putting that out there you know
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
with all the uncertainties um uh it's
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
context to think
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
about thank
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
you okay any else any other
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
comments all right seeing none we'll
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on HB
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:57.750 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on HB
1514

00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:00.029 --> 00:59:00.039 align:start position:0%
I'll open the work session on hp1
 
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
1558 and this is going to be a very easy
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
one uh representative PL I recommend itl
 
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
because the fish and game Department's
 
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:10.839 align:start position:0%
already instituted those fees and the
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
the SP sponsor came out with a letter
 
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.630 align:start position:0%
the SP sponsor came out with a letter
saying

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
such I got the right Bill
 
00:59:22.109 --> 00:59:22.119 align:start position:0%
yes you do
 
00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:25.400 align:start position:0%
um so this one um yeah this one's pretty
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
straightforward I think we all got the
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
email from representative Spain um
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
explaining that and that you didn't get
 
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
it um anyways it's
 
00:59:40.029 --> 00:59:40.039 align:start position:0%
uh yeah he's recommending to kill it so
 
00:59:41.069 --> 00:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's a whole lot of
 
00:59:43.549 --> 00:59:43.559 align:start position:0%
discussion there um does anyone have
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
anything they want to say seeing none
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:56.150 align:start position:0%
 
1558

00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
1558
 
00:59:58.589 --> 00:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
um now we'll open the uh work session on
 
01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
hb1 1484 relative to the current use
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:13.960 align:start position:0%
lands comments
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
first well let's see if there's anyone
 
01:00:17.789 --> 01:00:17.799 align:start position:0%
else there isn't representative
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
PL this bill I don't think has Merit I I
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
believe that the uh current use uh uh
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
tax is working quite well and the
 
01:00:32.109 --> 01:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
concern uh when the sponsor found out
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
after the fact that some land up there
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
was uh being not uh was being a
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
conservation land for the purpose of uh
 
01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
Mitigation Of clim for climate change
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
concern about drop in tax revenue
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
apparently that land will have a slower
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
Cut Rate than other land around it so I
 
01:00:54.029 --> 01:00:54.039 align:start position:0%
understand the concern but that land
 
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
will event eventually have to the timber
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
will eventually have to be cut or it'll
 
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
fall over and so it may a be a timing
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
issue and that's it and we had a lot of
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
change yes representa Le
 
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
please I just want to add that it may
 
01:01:15.390 --> 01:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
have some Merit in the sense that the
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
concern I think is valid the question
 
01:01:20.589 --> 01:01:20.599 align:start position:0%
asked I think it's valid um but I don't
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%
think that this solution is the right
 
01:01:23.839 --> 01:01:25.710 align:start position:0%
think that this solution is the right
solution

01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
so I would agree with representative PL
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative ORS uh thank you Mr
 
01:01:35.549 --> 01:01:35.559 align:start position:0%
chair yeah I just wanted to say if we
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
don't manage that Forest it's going to
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
be detrimental to the habitat and the
 
01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
wildlife and so yeah I'm not for this
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows I I
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
think that the carbon credit thing is
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
such a new issue that um it might be
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate to rethink the um current
 
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
use categories to make something that
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
would fit with this but that wouldn't be
 
01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
our job to do
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative
 
01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
elme thank you um this probably should
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
have gone
 
01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
to a environment and agriculture first
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
or resources and Recreation but
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
um the situation at the moment is that
 
01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
we really have no idea whether the
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
concern that was voiced is likely to
 
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.750 align:start position:0%
concern that was voiced is likely to
start

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:34.760 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
coming and it's very probable in New
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
for how many years about a hundred years
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
has been helped by the New Hampshire
 
01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
Society for the protection of forests uh
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
to manage the lands
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
on is not going to
 
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
see this problem in a large way so I
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
think that at the moment it's perfectly
 
01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.589 align:start position:0%
think that at the moment it's perfectly
proper

01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
proper
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
to just file the warning away as a
 
01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.390 align:start position:0%
to just file the warning away as a
possibility

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um it it seems like
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
everyone pretty much thinks this this
 
01:03:23.789 --> 01:03:23.799 align:start position:0%
bill is um not ready for prime time um
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take a quick straw poll how
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
itl I assuming represent duet
 
01:03:33.319 --> 01:03:36.349 align:start position:0%
itl I assuming represent duet
agrees

01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
itl okay um
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
so is there anything anyone else wants
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
to say I think it's pretty clear where
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
we're headed on this one all right great
 
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
we'll end the work session for 1484 I
 
01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:50.839 align:start position:0%
never expected we would be moving this
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
fast uh what about
 
01:03:53.279 --> 01:03:54.910 align:start position:0%
fast uh what about
1551

01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
1551
 
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
yeah that's next that's
 
01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:00.279 align:start position:0%
next so we're on our we're on our last
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
bill for uh for the work session which
 
01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
is hb1 1551 so I'll open the work
 
01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:08.559 align:start position:0%
session on hb1
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
1551 relative to distinguishing between
 
01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
C corporations and S corporations for
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
the purpose of calculating the business
 
01:04:15.359 --> 01:04:16.430 align:start position:0%
the purpose of calculating the business
profits

01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
profits
 
01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:21.710 align:start position:0%
profits
tax

01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
um who would like to make the uh first
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
one

01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.870 align:start position:0%
one
oh

01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:31.880 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
representative all good idea additional
 
01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
done could you elaborate no I'm just
 
01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:45.910 align:start position:0%
done could you elaborate no I'm just
kidding

01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
kidding
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
cinct yes I think that the bill amends
 
01:04:52.349 --> 01:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
the wrong part of law the testimony we
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
heard that it affected directly the
 
01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:55.480 align:start position:0%
business profits
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
tax and and the sponsor was surprised at
 
01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact uh and that's because
 
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
uh it was uh amening the wrong part of
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
law so I think this just is not ready
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
time okay representative spillsbury
 
01:05:19.510 --> 01:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
the hearing was extremely
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
murky and uh I think what it revealed is
 
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
that questions of how you delineate a C
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
Corp from a sub chapter as from an LLC
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
permeate across many different
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
provisions of law so that flaw was
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
evident immediately when we realized it
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
only amends BPT and not bet as
 
01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
representative PL just said but I
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
suspect that's only the tip of the
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
iceberg so if somebody thinks that this
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be sorted out it needs to be
 
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
sorted out in a fairly comprehensive way
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
um finally I think that as long as the
 
01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.029 align:start position:0%
um finally I think that as long as the
indd

01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:55.039 align:start position:0%
indd
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh tax is on its way to fa phase out
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
then I think that the sponsor's concern
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
is effectively moot or or soon to be and
 
01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:05.799 align:start position:0%
as representative Aly said in the
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
hearing we can Rectify that problem if
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
indd is reinstated but until then it's
 
01:06:16.750 --> 01:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
else okay so again straw pole on on 1551
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
itl okay
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
unanimous no it's not no what happened
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
you didn't raise your hand no I didn't
 
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor I'm not gonna
 
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.510 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor I'm not gonna
vote

01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
okay unanimous among non-
 
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors all right
 
01:06:55.630 --> 01:06:55.640 align:start position:0%
um that is I'll close hp15 51 I never
 
01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
expected we're going to get through all
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
those in an hour I apologize uh
 
01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
represent Aly for ending your testimony
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
I thought we were way
 
01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
behind but that's that's the beauty of
 
01:07:08.589 --> 01:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
this uh you never know that sometimes
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
the shortest things can take the longest
 
01:07:13.470 --> 01:07:13.480 align:start position:0%
and the longest can be short so it's
 
01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
always a always a challenge all right so
 
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
at this point um you all know we have an
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
exe executive session starting at 1 um
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
this effectively gives us two hours I
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
know both caucuses want a caucus um and
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
um and also have lunch so we have two
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%

Aly
 
03:08:06.630 --> 03:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
discussion representative plat the
 
03:08:09.229 --> 03:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
reason I'm moving to itl is since our
 
03:08:12.469 --> 03:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
country was founded we've uh given tax
 
03:08:12.479 --> 03:08:13.590 align:start position:0%
country was founded we've uh given tax
exemption

03:08:13.590 --> 03:08:13.600 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
03:08:17.590 --> 03:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
to churches um and uh they they provide
 
03:08:21.309 --> 03:08:21.319 align:start position:0%
a very useful uh service in in uh
 
03:08:23.710 --> 03:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
welfare and and taking care of the uh
 
03:08:27.110 --> 03:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
people who needed poor and indent um and
 
03:08:29.389 --> 03:08:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh regardless of denomination they're
 
03:08:31.150 --> 03:08:31.160 align:start position:0%
all doing that benefit this could kill
 
03:08:33.870 --> 03:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
them a lot we're already the least CH
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
state in the nation and this would uh
 
03:08:39.150 --> 03:08:39.160 align:start position:0%
drive a lot of out of existence and the
 
03:08:40.590 --> 03:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
government would have to pick up that
 
03:08:42.990 --> 03:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
cost eventually and if some people
 
03:08:45.190 --> 03:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
people quote well this refer to the
 
03:08:47.070 --> 03:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
separat of church and state there is no
 
03:08:50.150 --> 03:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
such thing the first amendment gives the
 
03:08:53.030 --> 03:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
churches the freedom of religion but
 
03:08:55.950 --> 03:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
does not so government stays the heck
 
03:08:58.950 --> 03:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
out of it but that but uh the church is
 
03:09:01.550 --> 03:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
are free to do uh what what they wish
 
03:09:03.150 --> 03:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
and they are providing a very useful
 
03:09:05.349 --> 03:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
service that's it thank
 
03:09:09.030 --> 03:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
you represent Alman I'd like to add to
 
03:09:12.429 --> 03:09:12.439 align:start position:0%
that that we give tax exemptions to an
 
03:09:15.469 --> 03:09:15.479 align:start position:0%
awful lot of other nonprofits and that
 
03:09:17.229 --> 03:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
would bring this into
 
03:09:19.910 --> 03:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
question you couldn't hear me you got to
 
03:09:21.309 --> 03:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
get closer to the
 
03:09:23.750 --> 03:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
mic I'm too
 
03:09:28.389 --> 03:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
short we we give tax exemptions to an
 
03:09:31.469 --> 03:09:31.479 align:start position:0%
awful lot of nonprofits that are not
 
03:09:34.030 --> 03:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
churches and this would raise the
 
03:09:36.030 --> 03:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
question of whether anybody should have
 
03:09:40.150 --> 03:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:43.710 --> 03:09:43.720 align:start position:0%

speak to your motion yes I have to catch
 
03:11:27.670 --> 03:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
up with this
 
03:11:27.680 --> 03:11:30.389 align:start position:0%
up with this
paperwork

03:11:30.389 --> 03:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
03:11:34.030 --> 03:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh this is a wash to the state uh this
 
03:11:36.670 --> 03:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
meels and wheels program it now works so
 
03:11:40.630 --> 03:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
that uh the restaurant uh bills
 
03:11:44.870 --> 03:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
$13 uh to the state that includes a tax
 
03:11:49.910 --> 03:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
and uh the the recipient older folk I'm
 
03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
one of them uh pays a the T tip there uh
 
03:11:56.910 --> 03:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
three or $ four do tip and they're
 
03:12:00.030 --> 03:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to put in $4 to the state uh as
 
03:12:00.040 --> 03:12:00.830 align:start position:0%
supposed to put in $4 to the state uh as
a

03:12:00.830 --> 03:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:12:03.870 --> 03:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
contribution uh but uh the the uh this
 
03:12:05.469 --> 03:12:05.479 align:start position:0%
would change the
 
03:12:09.150 --> 03:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
$13 uh be to $12 because it would
 
03:12:11.630 --> 03:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
eliminate the interested dividends tax
 
03:12:13.870 --> 03:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh that Ms and wheels picks up but on
 
03:12:15.429 --> 03:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
the other hand Ms and wheels turns
 
03:12:18.190 --> 03:12:18.200 align:start position:0%
around and builds the state for for this
 
03:12:21.229 --> 03:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
money um and so they'll be building $12
 
03:12:23.990 --> 03:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
instead of $13 so the dollar loss by the
 
03:12:26.710 --> 03:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
state is made up by the state so it's a
 
03:12:29.710 --> 03:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
it's a wash and it helps the
 
03:12:33.030 --> 03:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
program thank you representative fellows
 
03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm just want to say that I'm not
 
03:12:41.429 --> 03:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
sure that's accurate about um a cost um
 
03:12:44.070 --> 03:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
wash for the state because I believe
 
03:12:47.070 --> 03:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
that this money is all federal
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
money or ex except for it's Federal
 
03:12:55.070 --> 03:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
money except for the um the tax
 
03:12:57.790 --> 03:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
part M&amp;R tax you're talking about I
 
03:13:00.229 --> 03:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
think I think no you know I think the

that this makes a difference that this
 
03:13:20.269 --> 03:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
makes a difference to her objection but
 
03:13:22.830 --> 03:13:22.840 align:start position:0%
I looked into it and there is a small
 
03:13:27.150 --> 03:13:27.160 align:start position:0%

ORS thank you Mr chair I make a motion
 
03:15:35.150 --> 03:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
that we itl this
 
03:15:36.950 --> 03:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
legislation I think the bill
 
03:15:39.070 --> 03:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
inappropriately delegates taxing
 
03:15:41.389 --> 03:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
Authority away from the
 
03:15:41.399 --> 03:15:43.429 align:start position:0%
Authority away from the
states

03:15:43.429 --> 03:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:15:44.950 --> 03:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
do I have a
 
03:15:48.590 --> 03:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
second second
 
03:15:48.600 --> 03:15:50.510 align:start position:0%
second second
okay

03:15:50.510 --> 03:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:15:54.870 --> 03:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:00.750 --> 03:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
Aly um the municipalities already have
 
03:16:02.269 --> 03:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
the right to
 
03:16:06.070 --> 03:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
collect um fees for
 
03:16:06.080 --> 03:16:08.150 align:start position:0%
collect um fees for
automobiles

03:16:08.150 --> 03:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
automobiles
 
03:16:08.160 --> 03:16:09.950 align:start position:0%
automobiles
um

03:16:09.950 --> 03:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:13.229 --> 03:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
and and they
 
03:16:16.630 --> 03:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
keep proportions of various other fees
 
03:16:18.469 --> 03:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
for their
 
03:16:21.710 --> 03:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
expenses and I don't see that this would
 
03:16:28.630 --> 03:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:34.630 --> 03:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:37.710 --> 03:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
discussion uh representative Southworth
 
03:16:41.110 --> 03:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
yes I think um this bill does still need
 
03:16:43.150 --> 03:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
a little more work and probably an
 
03:16:46.990 --> 03:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
amendment um so I'm not sure I'm you
 
03:16:48.910 --> 03:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
know ready to do an up or down vote on
 
03:16:50.670 --> 03:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
it because I I think it needs a little
 
03:16:52.710 --> 03:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
more from the information we got at the
 
03:16:55.269 --> 03:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
hearings um there are some changes that
 
03:16:57.670 --> 03:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
need to be made but I'm not sure I'm
 
03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
ready to itl it thank
 
03:17:03.189 --> 03:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
you represent El me and I would just
 
03:17:05.710 --> 03:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
like to add to that that when we left
 
03:17:08.229 --> 03:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
this morning the idea is that we would
 
03:17:29.269 --> 03:17:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:32.150 --> 03:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
particularly the questions of what is a
 
03:17:35.070 --> 03:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
hotel and
 
03:17:38.790 --> 03:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
um and the amendment that was brought in
 
03:17:44.349 --> 03:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
already on saying what the Caps would be
 
03:17:49.550 --> 03:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:51.630 --> 03:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
this I don't believe that was this
 
03:17:53.110 --> 03:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
morning that was uh yesterday we
 
03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
discussed 1254 representative
 
03:17:59.870 --> 03:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I just want to add my voice to
 
03:17:59.880 --> 03:18:01.189 align:start position:0%
Ames yeah I just want to add my voice to
the

03:18:01.189 --> 03:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:18:04.150 --> 03:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh belief that I had that we'd have time
 
03:18:08.429 --> 03:18:08.439 align:start position:0%
to consider amending this and uh
 
03:18:10.750 --> 03:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
improving it I think we all felt there
 
03:18:13.189 --> 03:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
were uh parts of it that needed
 
03:18:17.710 --> 03:18:17.720 align:start position:0%
Improvement and um we didn't I F I
 
03:18:19.389 --> 03:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
understood we hadn't finished with that
 
03:18:23.070 --> 03:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
discussion and um would much prefer that
 
03:18:27.070 --> 03:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
we defer rather than uh go into a
 
03:18:30.710 --> 03:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
definitive vote at this time if that's
 
03:18:30.720 --> 03:18:35.429 align:start position:0%
definitive vote at this time if that's
possible

03:18:35.429 --> 03:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:37.910 --> 03:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't yeah I don't remember that
 
03:18:40.309 --> 03:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
specifically does um does anyone
 
03:18:43.710 --> 03:18:43.720 align:start position:0%
remember um anyone else 1254 I don't
 
03:18:47.189 --> 03:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
remember what whether we were going to
 
03:18:51.030 --> 03:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh defer that or not representative ORS
 
03:18:53.830 --> 03:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
yes I have in my notes here that it
 
03:18:57.070 --> 03:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
needed work as has been stated by uh
 
03:19:00.790 --> 03:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative ases and that uh maybe we
 
03:19:03.349 --> 03:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
would bring this forward again in fy2
 
03:19:06.790 --> 03:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:09.269 --> 03:19:09.279 align:start position:0%
notes I I think I thought my
 
03:19:11.150 --> 03:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
understanding also was that this might
 
03:19:13.830 --> 03:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
be something for the future but it w
 
03:19:17.349 --> 03:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of uh there was
 
03:19:19.150 --> 03:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
discussion on how it was a fairly
 
03:19:21.670 --> 03:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
complex to figure out how best to do
 
03:19:23.910 --> 03:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
this without uh
 
03:19:23.920 --> 03:19:25.830 align:start position:0%
this without uh
causing

03:19:25.830 --> 03:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
causing
 
03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
um issues between local and and state
 
03:19:32.469 --> 03:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
taxation um that was my understanding
 
03:19:34.590 --> 03:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
that was more like let's bring it up
 
03:19:36.590 --> 03:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
next year as opposed to let's talk about
 
03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
it again here but I may be mistaken
 
03:19:44.510 --> 03:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative Aly yes I'm I I uh
 
03:19:47.510 --> 03:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
Perhaps it is that it was how it was
 
03:19:50.429 --> 03:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
reported to me I thought that I remember
 
03:19:52.469 --> 03:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
discussing that this
 
03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
morning and the conclusion being but
 
03:19:59.110 --> 03:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
since I couldn't be here yesterday um I
 
03:20:01.229 --> 03:20:01.239 align:start position:0%
may have
 
03:20:05.790 --> 03:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
um uh I may be representing something
 
03:20:09.229 --> 03:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
that I thought was said
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
today or or yesterday actually uh yeah
 
03:20:15.349 --> 03:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
representative PL I remember it the way
 
03:20:18.389 --> 03:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
representative ORS does but having said
 
03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
that uh it wouldn't bother me at all if
 
03:20:22.750 --> 03:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
representative ORS changed to an interim
 
03:20:24.990 --> 03:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
study from an itl so it could come up
 
03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:26.269 align:start position:0%
study from an itl so it could come up
next

03:20:26.269 --> 03:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
next
 
03:20:28.469 --> 03:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
year I'm I'm not sure that's what they
 
03:20:28.479 --> 03:20:29.309 align:start position:0%
year I'm I'm not sure that's what they
were

03:20:29.309 --> 03:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:20:33.309 --> 03:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:36.229 --> 03:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
next right there's no effect on next
 
03:20:39.750 --> 03:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
year right representative rord yes thank
 
03:20:43.070 --> 03:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker and I I um so I I have
 
03:20:46.349 --> 03:20:46.359 align:start position:0%
some notes that I made too as well and I
 
03:20:48.150 --> 03:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
think it goes back to the issue and I
 
03:20:49.870 --> 03:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
think it's a valid issue I me the Val
 
03:20:53.070 --> 03:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
the issue is that some towns are being
 
03:20:55.870 --> 03:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
uh under being strained more than others
 
03:20:58.229 --> 03:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
yet they're not getting their fair share
 
03:21:00.510 --> 03:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
of in my opinion the meals and rooms tax
 
03:21:02.189 --> 03:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
and and I think that the issue is far
 
03:21:05.229 --> 03:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
more complex than
 
03:21:09.150 --> 03:21:09.160 align:start position:0%
um than the the rather simple approach
 
03:21:12.150 --> 03:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
that 1254 has so you know BAS on the
 
03:21:13.469 --> 03:21:13.479 align:start position:0%
notes that I had I I thought I was on
 
03:21:14.950 --> 03:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
the understanding that you know there
 
03:21:17.469 --> 03:21:17.479 align:start position:0%
was some consensus here that we believe
 
03:21:19.229 --> 03:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
that there is an issue here that there
 
03:21:22.309 --> 03:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
is some some meet here but perhaps next
 
03:21:23.790 --> 03:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
year being a budget year would be the
 
03:21:27.469 --> 03:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
more appropriate time to discuss that
 
03:21:29.550 --> 03:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
and and and you know that being said
 
03:21:31.469 --> 03:21:31.479 align:start position:0%
just I mean I I believe there there
 
03:21:33.910 --> 03:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be a solution to this um but I
 
03:21:35.670 --> 03:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
don't think 1254 does it and I don't
 
03:21:37.950 --> 03:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
think this is the right time to do it so
 
03:21:39.670 --> 03:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
um that's that's the recollection that I
 
03:21:41.469 --> 03:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
had and I wasn't here I was running in
 
03:21:43.269 --> 03:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
between meetings this morning but unless
 
03:21:44.469 --> 03:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
something was said otherwise this
 
03:21:47.710 --> 03:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
morning that's where I'd left it in my
 
03:21:51.670 --> 03:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
notes um well 12:54 we discussed on um
 
03:21:53.189 --> 03:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
yesterday not
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
today so so you were yeah we didn't yeah
 
03:21:59.030 --> 03:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
we didn't say anything else about it um
 
03:22:02.750 --> 03:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
I we also did a straw poll and of the 14
 
03:22:04.030 --> 03:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
members that were here yesterday it was
 
03:22:05.550 --> 03:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
seven to seven and it crossed party
 
03:22:08.950 --> 03:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
lines there was no um distinction there
 
03:22:12.830 --> 03:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
so I I I do remember it is this is
 
03:22:16.469 --> 03:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
something that needs work and perhaps in
 
03:22:19.110 --> 03:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
the next legislature but I could be
 
03:22:21.870 --> 03:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
wrong yes represent fellows um yes I I
 
03:22:23.349 --> 03:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
remember part of the discussion for
 
03:22:25.389 --> 03:22:25.399 align:start position:0%
yesterday and one of the things point
 
03:22:28.269 --> 03:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
that I made yesterday is that this bill
 
03:22:32.349 --> 03:22:32.359 align:start position:0%
has appeared before but um not at at
 
03:22:34.990 --> 03:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means I heard it heard this
 
03:22:37.670 --> 03:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
bill presented maybe it was two years
 
03:22:41.030 --> 03:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
ago at Municipal and County and that
 
03:22:41.040 --> 03:22:42.269 align:start position:0%
ago at Municipal and County and that
they

03:22:42.269 --> 03:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:22:45.269 --> 03:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
my recollection is it was not well
 
03:22:49.469 --> 03:22:49.479 align:start position:0%
received and it obviously didn't pass so
 
03:22:53.429 --> 03:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
I think that's another part
 
03:22:58.389 --> 03:22:58.399 align:start position:0%
of maybe why it needs to just go interim
 
03:23:01.349 --> 03:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
study and get some input from Municipal
 
03:23:03.630 --> 03:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
and County because it's not an issue
 
03:23:07.830 --> 03:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's related just to Ways and Means
 
03:23:10.189 --> 03:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
and it's really it's it's ways it's
 
03:23:13.309 --> 03:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
money for for the um the towns not the
 
03:23:15.510 --> 03:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
state anyway so I think Municipal and
 
03:23:19.030 --> 03:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
County really needs to have some kind of
 
03:23:23.950 --> 03:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:23.960 --> 03:23:27.349 align:start position:0%
 
bill

03:23:27.349 --> 03:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:30.950 --> 03:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
um so we yeah let's see our motion our
 
03:23:35.710 --> 03:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
that that straw poll was on um itl I
 
03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
believe but um certainly we could
 
03:23:43.150 --> 03:23:43.160 align:start position:0%
um uh represent or your your motion was
 
03:23:47.910 --> 03:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
itl yes represent Ames I think the sto
 
03:23:47.920 --> 03:23:49.870 align:start position:0%
itl yes represent Ames I think the sto
was

03:23:49.870 --> 03:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
whether one would support an
 
03:23:56.389 --> 03:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
OTP that's my my my note on that and I
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
agree with you it was 7 to S to s 7 to
 
03:24:02.229 --> 03:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
seven yeah yeah let me just I don't know
 
03:24:05.670 --> 03:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
we're all bad note takers chairman we
 
03:24:06.990 --> 03:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
seem to be all over the place on this
 
03:24:08.990 --> 03:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
particular one
 
03:24:11.229 --> 03:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
uh yeah and I just wrote straw Paul I
 
03:24:15.070 --> 03:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
didn't write the the motion so yes so I
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
don't I don't want to be repetitive but
 
03:24:19.309 --> 03:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
in our discussion yesterday I was
 
03:24:23.309 --> 03:24:23.319 align:start position:0%
certainly trying to tie this issue which
 
03:24:23.319 --> 03:24:24.550 align:start position:0%
certainly trying to tie this issue which
is

03:24:24.550 --> 03:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:24:28.510 --> 03:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
genuine to the meals and rooms um
 
03:24:31.870 --> 03:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
discussion and suggesting that uh there
 
03:24:34.710 --> 03:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
is a different approach with a local
 
03:24:37.189 --> 03:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
search charge that could be fashioned
 
03:24:37.199 --> 03:24:38.990 align:start position:0%
search charge that could be fashioned
for

03:24:38.990 --> 03:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
2025 in the context of meals and rooms I
 
03:24:44.189 --> 03:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
don't see a solution that we can drive
 
03:24:48.189 --> 03:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
to this year in the context of the fee
 
03:24:51.229 --> 03:24:51.239 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is drafted I agree with
 
03:24:53.990 --> 03:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative fellows I don't think
 
03:24:56.150 --> 03:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
that this committee should take any
 
03:24:59.070 --> 03:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
further action on this bill as
 
03:24:59.080 --> 03:25:01.469 align:start position:0%
further action on this bill as
drafted

03:25:01.469 --> 03:25:01.479 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
03:25:05.389 --> 03:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:05.399 --> 03:25:07.389 align:start position:0%
 
comment

03:25:07.389 --> 03:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
comment
 
03:25:07.399 --> 03:25:09.030 align:start position:0%
comment
representative

03:25:09.030 --> 03:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:25:12.630 --> 03:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
Aly yes I am really sorry that I was
 
03:25:15.429 --> 03:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
totally incapable of being here
 
03:25:15.439 --> 03:25:17.309 align:start position:0%
totally incapable of being here
yesterday

03:25:17.309 --> 03:25:17.319 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
03:25:20.429 --> 03:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
um because I think that there might have
 
03:25:24.550 --> 03:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
been more added to the discussion but
 
03:25:29.309 --> 03:25:29.319 align:start position:0%
um this I agree that the bill as it came
 
03:25:29.319 --> 03:25:30.830 align:start position:0%
um this I agree that the bill as it came
out

03:25:30.830 --> 03:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:25:34.550 --> 03:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
um because of the four days that we were
 
03:25:37.910 --> 03:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
given to submit bills uh there was a lot
 
03:25:40.990 --> 03:25:41.000 align:start position:0%
of cases where people got away with
 
03:25:44.030 --> 03:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
putting in alternate versions of a
 
03:25:48.670 --> 03:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
bill on that were almost the same and
 
03:25:51.590 --> 03:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
people got together as in the case of
 
03:25:56.269 --> 03:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
this bill and decided that um one person
 
03:25:59.269 --> 03:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
was going to have the bill and that
 
03:26:00.910 --> 03:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
person was someone who hasn't dealt with
 
03:26:04.269 --> 03:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
this over the 15 20 years it's been
 
03:26:04.279 --> 03:26:06.030 align:start position:0%
this over the 15 20 years it's been
discussed

03:26:06.030 --> 03:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
03:26:09.910 --> 03:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh and um there's
 
03:26:15.030 --> 03:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
definitely an issue isue in terms of of
 
03:26:15.040 --> 03:26:16.429 align:start position:0%
definitely an issue isue in terms of of
fairness

03:26:16.429 --> 03:26:16.439 align:start position:0%
fairness
 
03:26:19.910 --> 03:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
to to um different kinds of
 
03:26:23.590 --> 03:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities in this state about this
 
03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
I would hate to see the rooms and meals
 
03:26:30.309 --> 03:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
tax um done any other way it would
 
03:26:35.229 --> 03:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
really mess up a bunch of small towns um
 
03:26:39.830 --> 03:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
but uh this provides another option for
 
03:26:44.670 --> 03:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
it on we were going to provide a final
 
03:26:48.870 --> 03:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
amendment by next week but um if you
 
03:26:52.750 --> 03:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
want to do it today then I'll just I'll
 
03:26:54.870 --> 03:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
just be voting
 
03:26:57.229 --> 03:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
against thank
 
03:26:59.349 --> 03:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:27:01.510 --> 03:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
Edwards just just a question of
 
03:27:04.429 --> 03:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
clarification I think uh representative
 
03:27:06.950 --> 03:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
omy didn't wasn't there a very similar
 
03:27:09.229 --> 03:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
Bill to this four years ago in ways and
 
03:27:11.469 --> 03:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
means and and kind of the second
 
03:27:13.429 --> 03:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
question is if there was a suggestion
 
03:27:15.990 --> 03:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
this went that this committee kept it an
 
03:27:18.469 --> 03:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
interim study wouldn't you still need to
 
03:27:20.750 --> 03:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
get all your work done and completed
 
03:27:24.710 --> 03:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:27.870 --> 03:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
Senate no if we go in if we go interim
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
study it's we're moving it on it's going
 
03:27:33.229 --> 03:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
to move
 
03:27:37.150 --> 03:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
on okay yes representative
 
03:27:41.389 --> 03:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
ering yes if I think I have the
 
03:27:43.790 --> 03:27:43.800 align:start position:0%
parliamentary positioning correct you
 
03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
have a motion on the floor so we need to
 
03:27:49.269 --> 03:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
discuss the motion or the motion needs
 
03:27:52.229 --> 03:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
to be withdrawn to take any other action
 
03:27:55.309 --> 03:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
so it goes over to uh whether or not we
 
03:27:57.550 --> 03:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
want to hold this a week or not hold us
 
03:28:00.349 --> 03:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
a week um
 
03:28:03.750 --> 03:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
and I think as part of the discussion we
 
03:28:05.189 --> 03:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
can ask that
 
03:28:07.630 --> 03:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
question okay yes I'm I'm willing to
 
03:28:10.229 --> 03:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
withdraw my motion and make a a new
 
03:28:10.239 --> 03:28:14.309 align:start position:0%
withdraw my motion and make a a new
motion

03:28:14.309 --> 03:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:15.950 --> 03:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's two there's two things
 
03:28:18.670 --> 03:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
we can either make a new motion
 
03:28:22.950 --> 03:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
is or we can hold this a week because
 
03:28:22.960 --> 03:28:24.229 align:start position:0%
is or we can hold this a week because
the

03:28:24.229 --> 03:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:29.269 --> 03:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
um um minority member has suggested that
 
03:28:31.389 --> 03:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
uh there's an amendment that may or may
 
03:28:33.830 --> 03:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
not be
 
03:28:37.429 --> 03:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate okay
 
03:28:40.349 --> 03:28:40.359 align:start position:0%
um and you believe that your Amendment
 
03:28:41.710 --> 03:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
solves the
 
03:28:45.910 --> 03:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
problem of fairness between
 
03:28:49.469 --> 03:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
towns this is a as someone else said
 
03:28:53.229 --> 03:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
this is a partial solution of that
 
03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
problem which is a lot bigger that we've
 
03:29:03.750 --> 03:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
got uh municipalities that act as Urban
 
03:29:06.870 --> 03:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
hubs for all the municipalities around
 
03:29:10.630 --> 03:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
them and provide the social services
 
03:29:13.229 --> 03:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
nonprofit profit not taxed with the
 
03:29:18.670 --> 03:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
property tax uh and the um and take care
 
03:29:20.750 --> 03:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
of the traffic
 
03:29:25.950 --> 03:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
and and the criminal aspects of uh huge
 
03:29:28.110 --> 03:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
numbers of people
 
03:29:31.870 --> 03:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
concentrating into that town every day
 
03:29:34.670 --> 03:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
um but what is it solving what what
 
03:29:38.630 --> 03:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
which do not uh which only have except
 
03:29:41.750 --> 03:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
for a little bit of car tax uh
 
03:29:47.790 --> 03:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
we do not have uh the property tax
 
03:29:52.590 --> 03:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
for for 35,000 in Lebanon we have the
 
03:29:56.790 --> 03:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
property tax for 14,000 or 15,000
 
03:30:00.150 --> 03:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
whichever we are now uh in
 
03:30:02.910 --> 03:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
Lebanon representative
 
03:30:05.630 --> 03:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
ellerie it appears as though in out of
 
03:30:08.269 --> 03:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
Comedy I would suggest that uh this
 
03:30:11.189 --> 03:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
particular motion be tabled until the
 
03:30:13.870 --> 03:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
next executive session and be taken up
 
03:30:18.070 --> 03:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
at that point at the point we're at now
 
03:30:20.389 --> 03:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
which then would allow the minority uh
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
leader to present her Amendment and we
 
03:30:25.990 --> 03:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
can continue the discussion in that
 
03:30:28.429 --> 03:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
fashion if that would be acceptable to
 
03:30:31.830 --> 03:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
the uh membership of the committee yes
 
03:30:35.670 --> 03:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
represent Aly perhaps I could say that I
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
sent an amendment of the hotel language
 
03:30:44.590 --> 03:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
off to the three sponsors last night and
 
03:30:46.830 --> 03:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
I've only got word back from one of them
 
03:30:52.349 --> 03:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
so far okay uh yeah well you do have a
 
03:30:53.389 --> 03:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
question over there well I don't know if
 
03:30:55.349 --> 03:30:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's a followup to this I was going to
 
03:30:57.910 --> 03:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
ask if it was appropriate to Second um
 
03:31:00.550 --> 03:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative oler's motion to table
 
03:31:03.389 --> 03:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
yeah I I that would that was my I would
 
03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
a motion to table this until the next
 
03:31:08.269 --> 03:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
next executive meeting well we we don't
 
03:31:09.910 --> 03:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have to table we don't have to
 
03:31:11.630 --> 03:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
table representa
 
03:31:14.550 --> 03:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
um ORS can just withdraw his motion and
 
03:31:16.870 --> 03:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
then we'll bring it up another time but
 
03:31:20.189 --> 03:31:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:21.990 --> 03:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
go all
 
03:31:25.550 --> 03:31:25.560 align:start position:0%

03:37:37.309 --> 03:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
representative Aly uh uh said in in the
 
03:37:39.990 --> 03:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
previous bill this is not a budget year
 
03:37:42.990 --> 03:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
we we're $100 million roughly in Surplus
 
03:37:45.510 --> 03:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
but that could disappear it's too early
 
03:37:46.750 --> 03:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
and so next year when we're going
 
03:37:48.630 --> 03:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
through budget we have a firm handle and
 
03:37:50.110 --> 03:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
what happened with revenues the last
 
03:37:52.950 --> 03:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
couple of years we can talk tax changes
 
03:37:57.309 --> 03:37:57.319 align:start position:0%
at that time U up or down and uh of
 
03:38:00.990 --> 03:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
course uh any changes we we we should
 
03:38:03.550 --> 03:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
make or should be incremental to see
 
03:38:05.550 --> 03:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
what the impact is over time when
 
03:38:07.790 --> 03:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
revenues you don't want to be drastic
 
03:38:10.750 --> 03:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
either way in my view so that but bu
 
03:38:12.630 --> 03:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
budget year is much better than

03:41:06.910 --> 03:41:06.920 align:start position:0%

business profit tax allows a safe harbor
 
03:43:12.870 --> 03:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh for substantiating the value of um
 
03:43:16.429 --> 03:43:16.439 align:start position:0%

03:43:20.960 --> 03:43:21.990 align:start position:0%
members and an automatic Safe Harbor up
to

03:43:21.990 --> 03:43:22.000 align:start position:0%

2011 so um this bill changes that to
 
03:43:34.870 --> 03:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
$100,000 but more importantly it links
 
03:43:37.349 --> 03:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
the safe harbor to the Consumer Price
 
03:43:39.550 --> 03:43:39.560 align:start position:0%

03:46:04.110 --> 03:46:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:08.030 --> 03:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
2015 no it would go to affect the next
 
03:46:10.309 --> 03:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
the next year it wouldn't be it's not a
 
03:46:14.790 --> 03:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
appropo to 2024 January 1st 2025 2025
 
03:46:17.349 --> 03:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
correct um and it and it brings it more
 
03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
in line with the IRS code um which is
 
03:46:24.309 --> 03:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
represent spilsbury you may remember it
 
03:46:26.830 --> 03:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
was I know we keep asking it was 1 point
 
03:46:31.070 --> 03:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
for 2023 adjusted to a million 160
 
03:46:33.910 --> 03:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
million 160 okay um and we will be at a
 
03:46:35.229 --> 03:46:35.239 align:start position:0%
million which will be a little bit lower
 
03:46:38.349 --> 03:46:38.359 align:start position:0%
than that but closer uh in alignment to
 
03:46:40.149 --> 03:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
03:46:45.429 --> 03:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
uh Aly I think I'm going to be
 
03:46:47.910 --> 03:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh one vote against this
 
03:46:56.030 --> 03:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
but this was put into a the
 
03:47:00.110 --> 03:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
500,000 was put into effect and it was
 
03:47:03.229 --> 03:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
increased at that point from 100,000
 
03:47:05.349 --> 03:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
which had been in
 
03:47:10.950 --> 03:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
2010 I think it is no 20 um
 
03:47:14.110 --> 03:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
before that um
 
03:47:17.110 --> 03:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
and on
 
03:47:20.030 --> 03:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
it we've only got inflation up to the
 
03:47:28.269 --> 03:47:28.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:32.429 --> 03:47:32.439 align:start position:0%
69,000 in in today's
 
03:47:32.439 --> 03:47:33.950 align:start position:0%
69,000 in in today's
money

03:47:33.950 --> 03:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:47:38.469 --> 03:47:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh and it it just seems like it's quite
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
a large leap and we always have been
 
03:47:43.429 --> 03:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
below the federal government on these
 
03:47:46.469 --> 03:47:46.479 align:start position:0%
things and I see no justification in
 
03:47:49.429 --> 03:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
bringing us up to them when we're facing
 
03:47:53.389 --> 03:47:53.399 align:start position:0%
an uncertain Revenue future and expenses
 
03:47:59.110 --> 03:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:04.030 --> 03:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
year okay any um any other
 
03:48:07.030 --> 03:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
comments uh I guess I'll just say um in
 
03:48:08.790 --> 03:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
answer to that represent Al me I know we
 
03:48:11.469 --> 03:48:11.479 align:start position:0%
talked about this um at another time but
 
03:48:13.309 --> 03:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
the question is if if you're just
 
03:48:15.189 --> 03:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
looking at pure inflation I would agree
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
with you but the question is whether the
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
limit was correctly identified in the
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
first place and now you know being
 
03:48:25.429 --> 03:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
closer to the federal but still staying
 
03:48:27.429 --> 03:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
below it and reset it so the federal
 
03:48:29.590 --> 03:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
bounce is higher we're not a
 
03:48:31.070 --> 03:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
automatically being pulled higher we're
 
03:48:35.269 --> 03:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
at least uh staying in one spot
 
03:48:37.550 --> 03:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
um did you want to say anything else or
 
03:48:37.560 --> 03:48:38.389 align:start position:0%
um did you want to say anything else or
anyone

03:48:38.389 --> 03:48:38.399 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
03:48:40.910 --> 03:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
else I would like to know who made the
 
03:48:43.229 --> 03:48:43.239 align:start position:0%
motion I was doing something else the
 
03:48:45.229 --> 03:48:45.239 align:start position:0%

in the Northern woods it's so good it's
 
03:54:35.790 --> 03:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
copied by other states and I see no
 
03:54:37.950 --> 03:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
reason to take this forward as an itl
 
03:54:44.229 --> 03:54:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:46.149 --> 03:54:46.159 align:start position:0%
did you say did I misunder what did you
 
03:54:47.950 --> 03:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
just say do I you don't see a need to
 
03:54:50.870 --> 03:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
take I'm saying I I I don't I want to
 
03:54:53.590 --> 03:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
itl this yes okay yeah I think the way
 
03:54:55.110 --> 03:54:55.120 align:start position:0%
you said it it was like a double
 
03:54:57.550 --> 03:54:57.560 align:start position:0%
negative okay uh representative PL I
 
03:54:59.309 --> 03:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
would add that the concern from the
 
03:55:02.269 --> 03:55:02.279 align:start position:0%
author was lack uh because of a Slowdown
 
03:55:05.750 --> 03:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
in cutting lack of a loss of Timber tax
 
03:55:07.870 --> 03:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
I think that's simply timing not to loss
 
03:55:09.870 --> 03:55:09.880 align:start position:0%
through the life of the because they'd
 
03:55:12.229 --> 03:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
have to come down or rot so they will be
 
03:55:15.070 --> 03:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
cut the revenue will be there just on a
 
03:55:19.870 --> 03:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:22.990 --> 03:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
anticipated anybody
 
03:55:27.429 --> 03:55:27.439 align:start position:0%

form did you yeah not the roll
 
03:56:57.469 --> 03:56:57.479 align:start position:0%
call all right so he he figured out how
 
03:56:59.469 --> 03:56:59.479 align:start position:0%
to get himself a break but running out
 
03:56:59.479 --> 03:57:00.469 align:start position:0%
to get himself a break but running out
of

03:57:00.469 --> 03:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:34.710 align:start position:0%
 
often

03:57:34.710 --> 03:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:34.720 --> 03:57:37.590 align:start position:0%
 
that's

03:57:37.590 --> 03:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:37.600 --> 03:57:41.990 align:start position:0%
 
true

03:57:41.990 --> 03:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:44.870 --> 03:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
I have a question yes um so when we get
 
03:57:46.750 --> 03:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
into March do you think we're going to
 
03:57:50.710 --> 03:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:50.720 --> 03:57:52.389 align:start position:0%
 
Tuesdays

03:57:52.389 --> 03:57:52.399 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays
 
03:57:56.429 --> 03:57:56.439 align:start position:0%
um I don't know yet do you have a
 
03:57:59.510 --> 03:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
preference no I just in terms of trying
 
03:58:01.469 --> 03:58:01.479 align:start position:0%
to coordinate to get somebody from the
 
03:58:04.309 --> 03:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to come in um
 
03:58:05.990 --> 03:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
when we're doing the two bills about
 
03:58:09.469 --> 03:58:09.479 align:start position:0%
this Statewide property tax just to kind
 
03:58:10.870 --> 03:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
of give them you know I know it's not in
 
03:58:12.710 --> 03:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
the calendar yet but just to give them
 
03:58:16.590 --> 03:58:16.600 align:start position:0%
some kind of idea of when that will that
 
03:58:18.309 --> 03:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
will be in March for sure because we
 
03:58:20.910 --> 03:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
want to get past the 22nd uh and then
 
03:58:24.149 --> 03:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
the final the week of the 26th we're um
 
03:58:25.670 --> 03:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
going to observe the school vacation
 
03:58:27.830 --> 03:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
week and not have anything so it's going
 
03:58:33.229 --> 03:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
to be the March um I believe actually uh
 
03:58:35.349 --> 03:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that I think March 4th we
 
03:58:40.670 --> 03:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:43.309 --> 03:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm unavail I have conflicting
 
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
commission meeting and some other stuff
 
03:58:47.309 --> 03:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
happening on Monday the 4th so we will
 
03:58:50.469 --> 03:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
meet March 5th and 6th I just can't tell
 
03:58:52.790 --> 03:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
you what just just to you know try to
 
03:58:54.910 --> 03:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
coordinate with them you think so we
 
03:58:56.590 --> 03:58:56.600 align:start position:0%
probably would I mean I guess we would
 
03:58:59.110 --> 03:58:59.120 align:start position:0%
probably do the education bills on on
 
03:59:02.269 --> 03:59:02.279 align:start position:0%
the 5th probably five or six March five
 
03:59:03.870 --> 03:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
or sixth it's definitely probably fifth
 
03:59:07.070 --> 03:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
or sixth and we probably could do it on
 
03:59:09.030 --> 03:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
the 5th
 
03:59:11.110 --> 03:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
let me make a note though so if you're
 
03:59:12.710 --> 03:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
gonna are you GNA be telling them that
 
03:59:14.189 --> 03:59:14.199 align:start position:0%
now or Cas you know the person from
 
03:59:16.790 --> 03:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
education might be not available and
 
03:59:18.870 --> 03:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
plus he he spends a lot of time with the
 
03:59:21.469 --> 03:59:21.479 align:start position:0%
education committee so okay then why
 
03:59:23.349 --> 03:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
don't why don't you the thing I know
 
03:59:24.510 --> 03:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
right now is it's going to be the fifth
 
03:59:28.189 --> 03:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
or the 6th so you could yeah okay thank
 
03:59:33.189 --> 03:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
you yes representa leapley excuse me um
 
03:59:36.349 --> 03:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
just to clarify that's a Wednesday yes
 
03:59:40.110 --> 03:59:40.120 align:start position:0%
because I cancelled an appointment I had
 
03:59:43.510 --> 03:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
before I rescheduled for that day March
 
03:59:47.110 --> 03:59:47.120 align:start position:0%
6 is a Wednesday right yeah and we are
 
03:59:50.269 --> 03:59:50.279 align:start position:0%
meeting that day yeah okay thank you
 
03:59:52.830 --> 03:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
most likely meeting that day I mean
 
03:59:52.840 --> 03:59:55.349 align:start position:0%
most likely meeting that day I mean
because

03:59:55.349 --> 03:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:59:58.510 --> 03:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
well we're not going to meet Monday um
 
04:00:02.590 --> 04:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
March 4th um it's going to I mean I
 
04:00:05.510 --> 04:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
would think yes there's a
 
04:00:08.070 --> 04:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
strong possibility it would be the fifth
 
04:00:12.070 --> 04:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
in the six CU I we generally would need
 
04:00:14.469 --> 04:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
both those days so I think you can be
 
04:00:14.479 --> 04:00:17.269 align:start position:0%
both those days so I think you can be
pretty

04:00:17.269 --> 04:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:19.510 --> 04:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
sure and I'll try to when I have the
 
04:00:21.030 --> 04:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
schedule worked out just like I did with
 
04:00:23.110 --> 04:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
February uh last week I gave you the
 
04:00:25.030 --> 04:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much the rundown for February
 
04:00:26.630 --> 04:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
I'll try to do the same with March as
 
04:00:29.710 --> 04:00:29.720 align:start position:0%
best I can
 
04:00:31.630 --> 04:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
so I
 
04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
guess I should say that I think everyone
 
04:00:38.550 --> 04:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
here appreciates your efforts to make
 
04:00:41.710 --> 04:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
the schedule work for as many people as
 
04:00:43.910 --> 04:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
possible in a thank you you know
 
04:00:49.429 --> 04:00:49.439 align:start position:0%

getting so good at it we might as
 
04:01:17.429 --> 04:01:17.439 align:start position:0%
well and uh representative spillsbury
 
04:01:18.990 --> 04:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your
 
04:01:23.910 --> 04:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you um the sponsor was
 
04:01:29.790 --> 04:01:29.800 align:start position:0%
trying to address a um past problem with
 
04:01:31.590 --> 04:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
the potential of double
 
04:01:35.309 --> 04:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
taxation uh regarding sub chapter S
 
04:01:39.550 --> 04:01:39.560 align:start position:0%
corporations and uh yet
 
04:01:42.349 --> 04:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that the um interest in
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
dividends tax is being phased out and
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
will soon disappear would moot that
 
04:01:48.120 --> 04:01:49.670 align:start position:0%
will soon disappear would moot that
problem

04:01:49.670 --> 04:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:01:52.110 --> 04:01:52.120 align:start position:0%
furthermore we it became apparent that
 
04:01:54.030 --> 04:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
the bill had addressed only the business
 
04:01:55.750 --> 04:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
profits tax and not the business
 
04:01:58.550 --> 04:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax so it wouldn't actually
 
04:02:01.070 --> 04:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
solve the problem without some Amendment
 
04:02:03.429 --> 04:02:03.439 align:start position:0%
and it further revealed that there are
 
04:02:06.469 --> 04:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
maybe deeper uh issues in review that
 
04:02:09.349 --> 04:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
could be done about how we distinguish
 
04:02:13.870 --> 04:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh C corpse from sub chapter S so the
 
04:02:16.670 --> 04:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
bill is not needed at this time and a
 
04:02:18.790 --> 04:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
further review could be done at the in a
 
04:02:18.800 --> 04:02:20.070 align:start position:0%
further review could be done at the in a
future

04:02:20.070 --> 04:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
future

like to get these if we can into the
 
04:04:20.070 --> 04:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
upcoming calendar which means that I
 
04:04:22.510 --> 04:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
would need them
 
04:04:25.990 --> 04:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
by by noon well no the the the speaker
 
04:04:28.110 --> 04:04:28.120 align:start position:0%
the other day may maybe you missed the
 
04:04:31.349 --> 04:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
that meeting but uh the speaker was
 
04:04:34.229 --> 04:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
truly insisting that the people writing
 
04:04:36.550 --> 04:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
reports not leave the room until they've
 
04:04:39.189 --> 04:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
written their report yeah
 
04:04:41.750 --> 04:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
well he's trying just just to let you
 
04:04:44.670 --> 04:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
know okay yeah I did miss that meeting
 
04:04:47.030 --> 04:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
what's that he's trying to he wants to
 
04:04:50.790 --> 04:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
get as many in as possible so um given
 
04:04:52.389 --> 04:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
that the speaker wants as many of these
 
04:04:56.349 --> 04:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
in as possible I probably need I mean if
 
04:04:59.429 --> 04:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
you if you it's only 2 o'clock we did
 
04:05:02.070 --> 04:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
very well so if you can stay and write
 
04:05:07.550 --> 04:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
it now I will stay and wait for it um do
 
04:05:09.309 --> 04:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
we need to write a report if it's going
 
04:05:13.229 --> 04:05:13.239 align:start position:0%
on consent yes okay still needs a report
 
04:05:16.630 --> 04:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
I still need to review it um so I guess
 
04:05:18.070 --> 04:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
I would ask people who are writing
 
04:05:20.149 --> 04:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
reports to stay and write them now and
 
04:05:22.429 --> 04:05:22.439 align:start position:0%
