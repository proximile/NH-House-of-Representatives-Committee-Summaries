juvenile offenses States if the court
 
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
finds that a minor is delinquent the
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
court shall order the least restrictive
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
of the following dispositions which the
 
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
court finds is the most appropriate to
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
emphasize the court shall order the
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
least restrictive which is most
 
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.690 align:start position:0%
least restrictive which is most
appropriate

00:17:59.690 --> 00:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
there are two types of incarceration
 
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
impacted by this bill the first is
 
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.870 align:start position:0%
impacted by this bill the first is
commitment

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
commitment is what occurs after the
 
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory hearing or trial at which
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
the miners found guilty or after a plea
 
00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:15.049 align:start position:0%
the miners found guilty or after a plea
agreement

00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
the second type of incarceration is
 
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.529 align:start position:0%
the second type of incarceration is
detention

00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:18.539 align:start position:0%
detention
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
detention is analogous to an adult being
 
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
held without bail after arrest one of
 
00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
the goals of this amendment was to
 
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of children being held
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
without bail for offenses that typically
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
would not result in an adult being held
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
without bail as concur occur under the
 
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
existing law one aspect of this bill is
 
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
the Limitless offenses for which a child
 
00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:45.539 align:start position:0%
may be held without bail in the absence
 
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
of extenuating circumstances to Serious
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
holding children in jail is not the best
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
way to help them towards a better path
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has spent tens of millions
 
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
of dollars now into the hundreds of
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars over the past four
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
years on a system of care for children
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
we lead the nation in developing these
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
wrap-around service that provides a
 
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
child and their family with 24 hour a
 
00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:16.940 align:start position:0%
day seven day a week real-time support
 
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
that support ideally comes at the
 
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
child's home setting but as that becomes
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
unworkable New Hampshire has built a
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
network of residential facilities
 
00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
dealing with the increasing level of
 
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.169 align:start position:0%
dealing with the increasing level of
support

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
so the committee Amendment focuses on
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
keeping these children accused of
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
low-level offenses in these types of
 
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
facilities these provide a better
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
in trauma-informed care to help the
 
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
children at the same time they provide a
 
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
less costly alternative to the state
 
00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:54.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
we have heard about in the about in
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
committee about the building during this
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
process how we must rush to get this
 
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
bill to complete construction we
 
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
appropriated funding to secure a
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
forensic Hospital four years ago with
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
the same urgent need we still haven't
 
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
broken ground on the construction of
 
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
that facility today the reality is the
 
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
current environment it will take time to
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
build a replacement in the meantime
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
we'll focus on the culture of the
 
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
facility where the children will be held
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
part of this amendment puts forth
 
00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:30.539 align:start position:0%
guidelines that the director of the
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
facility will have a background in
 
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
Psychology nursing social work or
 
00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:36.919 align:start position:0%

trauma-informed care in congregate
 
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
settings with juveniles
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
but in light of the fact that the
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
current operating costs in the facility
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
can exceed one million dollars per child
 
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.549 align:start position:0%
can exceed one million dollars per child
year

00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
the guidelines are included to provide
 
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
that the new facility be designed with
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
operating costs in mind and that these
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
costs be reviewed at least biannually
 
00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:03.299 align:start position:0%
Banning allele thank you the committee
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:07.020 align:start position:0%

the understanding of the desired
 
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:10.820 align:start position:0%
cultural change
 
00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:13.460 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care means a program
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
organization or system that realizes the
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%

other individuals involved with the

by fully integrating knowledge about

our committee Amendment provides for
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
additional information in the quarterly
 
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:45.260 align:start position:0%
report provided to the legislature
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%

excluding any personal information this

is not currently available making it
 
00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
difficult to analyze what is bringing
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
children into the facility and the
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
breakdown of those being detained or

chair recognize representative Edwards
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Speaker I I wasn't
 
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
prepared to do this I had been led to
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
believe that there wasn't going to be
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
any opposition to the floor Amendment
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
because of the extremely strong support
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
of the advocacy community and so I I
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
understood that we had all agreed to
 
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
agree and speaking of agreeing to
 
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.350 align:start position:0%
agree and speaking of agreeing to
agreeing

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
agreeing
 
00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
everything that you just heard from the
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
well is the exact same thing as as what
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
is in the uh alternative amendment that
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see in a bit but there are a
 
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:42.140 align:start position:0%
couple of exceptions for it
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
the word was used that there are
 
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards yes your Fuller
 
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
Amendment isn't up yet so no I know I'm
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
now I'm speaking to the remarks of the
 
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
so so like I said the the goal stated by
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker the words in the
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
Preamble about uh
 
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
trying to find the path to the least
 
00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:13.220 align:start position:0%
restrictive care for the uh the the
 
00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
juvenile involved in the system all of
 
00:24:18.649 --> 00:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
that is the same There's no distinction
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
the term Limitless reasons why somebody
 
00:24:23.529 --> 00:24:23.539 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
placed in the facility is just false
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's not Limitless they're they're
 
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
specified they're enumerated they've
 
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:34.860 align:start position:0%
been reviewed by the judicial system
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
there's a worksheet on it where you have
 
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
to tick off specific things it's
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
extremely well-bounded extremely well
 
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
disciplined it is not at all Limitless
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
and and I propose that we should not be
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
changing that on the Fly what do I mean
 
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:00.620 align:start position:0%
the most onerous most objectionable
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
aspects of this current finance
 
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
committee amendment is that it was all
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
done in a non-germaine amendment in a
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
crisis time when Finance is supposed to
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
be focusing on closing in on the budget
 
00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
and although children and family law had
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
HB 120 and although the members of
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
division three had been invited in
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
January to sit in with the children and
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
family law back in January
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
this these proposals to change the
 
00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
Public Safety Code and to add some
 
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
budgetary restrictions these all came
 
00:25:42.649 --> 00:25:42.659 align:start position:0%
in the last week where Finance is
 
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
supposed to be focusing on a 13 billion
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
dollar two-year budget this was not the
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
time to bring it to finance nor was it
 
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
the correct committee to to bring it to
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
the committee of jurisdiction in this
 
00:25:59.690 --> 00:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
case is children and family law and we
 
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
had the chairman of Children and Family
 
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
Law come to us during that non-germaine
 
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
Amendment hearing and specifically ask
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
us to not pass those
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
um restrictions those Provisions to let
 
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
them with as the committee of
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction review them so so why is
 
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
there a need to move forward with this
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
we have to build a facility to build a
 
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:29.940 align:start position:0%
facility we need money we are attempting
 
00:26:33.289 --> 00:26:33.299 align:start position:0%
to lock in the federal money so it
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
minimizes the state general funds
 
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
expenditure every time we delay this and
 
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
has been delayed successfully way too
 
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
many times every time we delay this we
 
00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
put at risk the the use of the federal
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
funds so we got to stop the delay and we
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
got to move forward if the if this
 
00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
finance bill gets to the Senate it's
 
00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:57.419 align:start position:0%
going to be rejected excuse me the other
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
body it's going to just be rejected and
 
00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:01.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to end up going into another
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference or maybe a
 
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
committee of chaos we should not do what
 
00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:09.020 align:start position:0%
we know will fail
 
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
and it's not just me saying that the
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
finance Amendment will fail we have The
 
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.620 align:start position:0%

this so if you will vote in opposition

of the finance Amendment then we can
 
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
introduce a another amendment that has
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
tremendous Broad and deep support by our
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%

Mr speaker thank you as always for your
 
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
courtesy and agreeing to change how this
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
debate would proceed and I would like to
 
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
welcome the people who are in in the
 
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
gallery who over the years I have worked
 
00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:49.740 align:start position:0%
with very closely on so many issues
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
where we share the same concerns
 
00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
I rise today in support
 
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
of the amendment to House Bill 49 that
 
00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:06.620 align:start position:0%
passed the committee with a 23 to 2 vote
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
15 years ago I was privileged to serve a
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
chair of house finance and was
 
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
introduced to the synonym Youth
 
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
Development Center
 
00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
what I learned has been on my conscience
 
00:29:25.669 --> 00:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
ever since
 
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
if we were to be judged by how we treat
 
00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:30.539 align:start position:0%
our children
 
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
indeed our children most in need of help
 
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
we would be found wanting
 
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
the juvenile system was created more
 
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
than a hundred years ago as research
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that children are not
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
miniature adults
 
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
and in each succeeding decade we have
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
learned more about how human brains
 
00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.169 align:start position:0%
learned more about how human brains
develop

00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
develop
 
00:30:00.169 --> 00:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
putting young people who have not
 
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
behaved according to acceptable
 
00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
Community standards in prison is
 
00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:07.490 align:start position:0%
Community standards in prison is
guaranteeing

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
that it will be almost impossible for
 
00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
them to function successfully in society
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
but that is what we have done and are
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
still doing at the sununa center
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
I will not address in any detail today
 
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
the appalling Behavior by some dcyf
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
employees that has come to light
 
00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
but I will address the culture the
 
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
culture of the institution young people
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
were kept in isolation violating the
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
most Elementary understanding we have of
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
human growth and development they were
 
00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:48.539 align:start position:0%
kept in restraints
 
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
violating our own state law when a
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
federal agency confronted them they
 
00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
replied that they were working on how to
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
comply with state law not at all
 
00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
concerned that they were in violation
 
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
just this week
 
00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
three days ago the individual
 
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
responsible for the agency confirmed
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
that children at sysc are strip searched
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
they are strip searched every time they
 
00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:24.539 align:start position:0%
leave and return to the facility going
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
to court
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
to medical appointment or a family visit
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
can you imagine how that traumatizes
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
already vulnerable young people
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
the committee amendment that passed 23-2
 
00:31:44.289 --> 00:31:44.299 align:start position:0%
was supported by
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
two former Finance chairs one Republican
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
and one Democrat
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
a former Republican chair
 
00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:56.220 align:start position:0%
of children and family a former chair of
 
00:31:58.730 --> 00:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
Finance who is still serving on finance
 
00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:03.020 align:start position:0%
and in fact the current chair of Finance
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
what this amendment addresses and what
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
opponents seem to focus on is language
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
addressing over Staffing concerns and
 
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
per bed cost after all it is the finance
 
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
committee and when they say it's not the
 
00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:21.539 align:start position:0%
money you know it's the money
 
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
both of these sections are advisory and
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
do not set a specific budget they are
 
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
attempting to deal with the bloated
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
budget of sysc over the past decade that
 
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
dcyf has shown no ability to reasonably
 
00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:40.610 align:start position:0%
dcyf has shown no ability to reasonably
control

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
those of us who support this amendment
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
believe that fewer children should be
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
committed or detained and instead should
 
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
be cared for in their own communities
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
this not only affects the budget but it
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
keeps many low-level offenders from
 
00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.090 align:start position:0%
keeps many low-level offenders from
incarceration

00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
incarceration
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
we know that incarceration is a
 
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
traumatic experience for anyone but
 
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:09.260 align:start position:0%
especially for vulnerable children
 
00:33:12.289 --> 00:33:12.299 align:start position:0%
opponents focus on why children should
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
be incarcerated we're focusing on why
 
00:33:18.169 --> 00:33:18.179 align:start position:0%
children charge with low-level offenses
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
should be treated in the children's
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
system of care a system focused on
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
community-based treatment that we have
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
appropriated tens of millions of dollars
 
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
to implement
 
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
yet we continue to over incarcerate
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
children charged with low-level offenses
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
while legislative pressure has resulted
 
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
in a dramatic decline in the number of
 
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
children currently incarcerated we have
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
failed miserably in changing the culture
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
our Amendment and the finance passed
 
00:33:59.169 --> 00:33:59.179 align:start position:0%
Bill takes several steps to assure that
 
00:34:03.529 --> 00:34:03.539 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care is the focus of
 
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:07.140 align:start position:0%
the new facility and the current care
 
00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:10.379 align:start position:0%
for these children we address cultural
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
concerns within the facility by
 
00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
prescribing direct or qualifications we
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
would require that the direct director
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
be not a corrections officer a warden
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
but a trained professional in dealing
 
00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:28.619 align:start position:0%
with children with very special needs we
 
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
do not assume that we know all the
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
answers we ask in fact for additional
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
data to assess the effectiveness of
 
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
these interventions
 
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
we provide a clear definition of
 
00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care we require sysc to
 
00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:49.210 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care we require sysc to
practice

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:49.220 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care and we require that
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
staff should be trained and trained now
 
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
in trauma-informed care you don't need a
 
00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339 align:start position:0%
new building to start that
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
when we decided to build sysc 20 years
 
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.070 align:start position:0%
when we decided to build sysc 20 years
ago

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
the department told us that this would
 
00:35:14.089 --> 00:35:14.099 align:start position:0%
fix the issues at YDC its predecessor
 
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
the Youth Development Center such as
 
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
overcrowding and allegations of abuse 20
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
years later the sununu center has the
 
00:35:28.089 --> 00:35:28.099 align:start position:0%
same problems the same problems as YDC
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
and now the director tells us I know
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
better this new facility will fix the
 
00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.510 align:start position:0%
better this new facility will fix the
issues

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
you likely have heard and perhaps even
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
read that there actually and you've
 
00:35:46.609 --> 00:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
heard from the sponsor that there is
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
um another amendment
 
00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in that amendment that
 
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
assures that the new facility will be
 
00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:00.500 align:start position:0%
anything other than a a miniature sysc
 
00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:03.720 align:start position:0%
there is nothing that says that we won't
 
00:36:05.569 --> 00:36:05.579 align:start position:0%
be doing the same things we've been
 
00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
doing for years and failing
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
the same thing that caused more than a
 
00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:14.099 align:start position:0%
thousand children to allege physical and
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse the state has been made
 
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:20.220 align:start position:0%
liable for hundreds of millions of
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
dollars as if money could heal wounded
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
bodies and Minds
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
and the fact that nearly two-thirds of
 
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
the Children released from the sununu
 
00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
as recidivists indicating the inadequacy
 
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
of the treatment they received this
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
should not be baseball's Field of Dreams
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
if we build it they will come if you
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
think that thousands of children
 
00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
alleging abuse indicates that we need to
 
00:36:56.329 --> 00:36:56.339 align:start position:0%
take a different approach to the
 
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
treatment of juveniles then you should
 
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
vote for House Bill 49 as passed with
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
the committee amendment 23-2 by the
 
00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:08.099 align:start position:0%
finance committee and reject any
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
additional amendments as the committee
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
did by an equally strong vote thank you
 
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the ought to
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
pass motion on
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
no Mr chair I missed it
 
00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:50.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
we've had a question a request for a
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
yes we're doing the pi yes what's that
 
00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:41.630 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.990 --> 00:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is adoption of
 
00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:11.660 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
0892h this is a division vote
 
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Edwards
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Speaker uh I Rise to
 
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
explain uh that if if I knew
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
if I knew that uh today was the first
 
00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:47.750 align:start position:0%
if I knew that uh today was the first
time

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:40:51.609 --> 00:40:51.619 align:start position:0%
any representative has publicly said
 
00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
that they don't want any new facility to
 
00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
be built
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's shocking and if I knew that the
 
00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
finance amendment was rushed and the
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
issues in it went to the wrong committee
 
00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
and if I knew that this bill will be
 
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
rejected by the other body
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
leading to a committee of Chaos
 
00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
this is how it failed last time we got
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
hung up in a committee of chaos and if I
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
knew division three has directed the
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
equipment to replace the strip search
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
upon the very first term we even heard
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
that was an issue we immediately
 
00:41:34.609 --> 00:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
approved 300 000 to go get the equipment
 
00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
because we care about this this is a
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
parliamentary yeah and if I knew that
 
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
many Finance people in finance voted for
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
I'll call it the Lynn Amendment which is
 
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:48.540 align:start position:0%
before you because it was less bad than
 
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
the first alternative and that the
 
00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
amendment sponsor opposes it now is do I
 
00:41:58.810 --> 00:41:58.820 align:start position:0%
I voted for it to
 
00:42:02.089 --> 00:42:02.099 align:start position:0%
preserve some flexibility and and then
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
if I knew that I agree that the past
 
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
decade has been a failure representative
 
00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:11.339 align:start position:0%
this is a problem this is the last one
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
if if I'm
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
if I knew that the past decade has been
 
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
a failure in coming up with a new
 
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
concept would I and that this is going
 
00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:29.099 align:start position:0%
to be a new trauma-informed therapeutic
 
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
center would I now vote and press red in
 
00:42:35.569 --> 00:42:35.579 align:start position:0%
order to kill the amendment so that
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
do you recognize representative hole for
 
00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
if I know that children's lives matter
 
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
and sometimes children make bad choices
 
00:42:58.849 --> 00:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
by accident not premeditated choices but
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
accidental choices
 
00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
without understanding the consequences
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
of those choices
 
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
if I agree with The Advocates who want
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
to change the Paradigm to
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care so children who are
 
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
growing up and developing have a better
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
shot at Living outside of the Criminal
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
if I know that today we spend between
 
00:43:25.849 --> 00:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
800 and 800 000 in a million dollars per
 
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
child for incarceration
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
and that the amendment tries to drive
 
00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
that to the more normal cost of four
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
if I know that we discuss Staffing
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
ratios at four staff members per child
 
00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
not some of the hyperbole I've heard
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
if I know that The Advocates were asking
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
for at least one to three and we were 12
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
times that amount because children's
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
lives matter
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this could have
 
00:43:59.569 --> 00:43:59.579 align:start position:0%
started years ago in the same facility
 
00:44:01.609 --> 00:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
all the changes that we're asking for
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
require some of the statutory
 
00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.470 align:start position:0%
require some of the statutory
construction

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
if I know I will represent the
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
representative this is a parliamentary
 
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:14.220 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
honorable General Court I rise today in
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to the amendment of HB
 
00:47:59.809 --> 00:47:59.819 align:start position:0%
491004 for several reasons
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
for one I was born and raised in the
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die state in Match Vegas as
 
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
we called it
 
00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.390 align:start position:0%
we called it
um

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
and I know all about what YDC was I had
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
a very good friend that went to YDC Paul
 
00:48:19.089 --> 00:48:19.099 align:start position:0%
and uh was actually one of the the cases
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
the stain on this state is unbearable
 
00:48:27.609 --> 00:48:27.619 align:start position:0%
and this is this amendment is actually
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
not the way to go I believe that we have
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
to support exactly what the committee
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
adopted I don't care what deals were
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
brokered the main change of this is
 
00:48:41.569 --> 00:48:41.579 align:start position:0%
about the money
 
00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
and this going over to in a sense
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
the governor and the executive Council
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
and the joint legislative fiscal
 
00:48:50.809 --> 00:48:50.819 align:start position:0%
committee and that's really where this
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
comes to is we as the general court are
 
00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
first and foremost all money bills
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
should be coming through US ten thousand
 
00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
dollars anything above that is coming
 
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
through us we are not
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
we not by six people which means the
 
00:49:09.109 --> 00:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
governor in the executive Council which
 
00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
have been rubber stamping millions of
 
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:13.260 align:start position:0%
dollars under our noses our constitution
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
clearly states The Entity of the general
 
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
court our our basically our Authority is
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
us not a portion or a committee or
 
00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
subsidiary we have already seen these
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
land grabs happen very recently in the
 
00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
last two years of the last budget for
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
example for any Representatives that are
 
00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
from belknack County and they know what
 
00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
took place and what got pushed into the
 
00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
budget last which was the Laconia land
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
grab everyone knows that correctly how
 
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
about the folks that are here the
 
00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
representative I would extend that you
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
keep your remarks to the amendment
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
okay so this is about the amendment
 
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
because this is basically giving the
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
governing the executive Council carte
 
00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
blanche of 150 acres of prime real
 
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
estate that's what's going to happen
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
right now the department of
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
administrative services will take care
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
of the sale of the property I believe
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
this property should be
 
00:50:14.089 --> 00:50:14.099 align:start position:0%
should be utilized to represent all of
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
the children that were abused more than
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
a thousand that have come through
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
um at this point build a beautiful Park
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
have a water park have a memorial for
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
these this is there this should be their
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
money not our money we shouldn't be
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
making money on this because of what of
 
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
other abuses that took place for all of
 
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
those years in 1855 the sole purposes of
 
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
that property was for the Reformation of
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
juveniles it was selected because it was
 
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:43.500 align:start position:0%
a hundred plus acres of prime Farmland
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
if you are from new Manchester you know
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
that is the North End of Manchester it
 
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
is Prime real estate it's in a beautiful
 
00:50:53.329 --> 00:50:53.339 align:start position:0%
part of the city
 
00:50:53.339 --> 00:50:53.870 align:start position:0%
part of the city
um

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
my last thing I want to say is that it
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
took place in Concord for the same exact
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
thing that happened two years ago
 
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
um it was actually you know where the
 
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
old Administrative Building is it's on
 
00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh Stickney Street
 
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
um the governor actually sold that to
 
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
his Brady Sullivan folks and it was
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
supposed to be to the city of Concord
 
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
this this has nothing to do with the
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
amendment so one million dollars that
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
was sold for when it actually is a
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar property that's
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen representative it
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the amendment
 
00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
does it does okay so please
 
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:39.480 align:start position:0%

these kids and looking at the
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
alternative that they've helped craft
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%

is really about how we got here the
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
distinct distinctions between the
 
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:10.380 align:start position:0%

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:12.540 align:start position:0%

amendment and I'm proud to sponsor this

chairman of the Judiciary is on as a
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor here you received the letter
 
00:53:08.329 --> 00:53:08.339 align:start position:0%
what was this about
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
well in the very beginning of the sununu
 
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
center it was built for 144 kids and it
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
was built built mostly to be a jail
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
in the last decade the legislature has
 
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
been complaining about the sununu center
 
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
and no effective action was taken I
 
00:53:27.049 --> 00:53:27.059 align:start position:0%
thought we had this taken care of two
 
00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
years ago until an agreement that was uh
 
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
was put into place uh it got killed in
 
00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
the committee conference
 
00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:39.059 align:start position:0%
two bills had passed both sides of the
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
house there was a path to reconciling
 
00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
them but the reconciliation was rejected
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
at the last minute on a broken promise
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
we then formed a joint committee to look
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
at the replacement
 
00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
out of that came sb1 and hb120 you know
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
sb1 we did a slim down amendment of it a
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
few months ago there was also H20 which
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
HB 2120 which was a parallel bill that
 
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
children and family law heard with
 
00:54:12.109 --> 00:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
division three present and they've
 
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
chosen to retain it to help you know
 
00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.339 align:start position:0%
address any stray issues that that may
 
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
come out of this effort
 
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
initially the sununu center was a jail
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
everyone has agreed that we need a rep
 
00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
to replace it with the trauma-informed
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
therapeutic care model we've all agreed
 
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
to that so so please don't listen to the
 
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:36.780 align:start position:0%
distractions because we've all agreed to
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
that that's why the community is on
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
board as a matter of fact so what what
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
did we do this bill focuses on the
 
00:54:47.569 --> 00:54:47.579 align:start position:0%
change concept going from a jail to a
 
00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:50.099 align:start position:0%
health care setting that's secured okay
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
so as a health care professional planner
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
I know this is a health care setting of
 
00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
course the facility is a key part of it
 
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
today is the first time anyone stepped
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
forward and say they don't want a
 
00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:04.980 align:start position:0%
facility it's kind of late in the
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
process there's also Workforce issues in
 
00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:11.819 align:start position:0%
here on on the kinds of clinical care
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
that should be available there's also
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
service sharing that's in here so that
 
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
we can be smart about the resources that
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
go into it for future operations and
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
then the funding that I mentioned we
 
00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
made sure that all the money that we
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
could came out of the federal money if
 
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839 align:start position:0%
we delay this we're putting that Federal
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
money at risk
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
so 120 hb120 Was Heard and retained by
 
00:55:38.089 --> 00:55:38.099 align:start position:0%
children in family law
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
and that's ready for further study the
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
leadership of Children and Family Law
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
are all on board that they're going to
 
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
listen to any new ideas and consider it
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
and bring legislation forward uh in in
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
January should there be a need
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
got a 12 to 13 vote in finance and one
 
00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
of the members happened to be a
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
republican I think would change their
 
00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
vote if they had a chance to do it again
 
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
so had we been able to get this 13 to 12
 
00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
we might not be here today
 
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.770 align:start position:0%
we might not be here today
what

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
has happened is that the bills and I'm
 
00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
so sorry to talk so long you know I
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
really am because I just did not
 
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
anticipate any of the prior debate I but
 
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
but so anyways the things that you must
 
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
know to make this vote because this is
 
00:56:35.450 --> 00:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
about the future
 
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
there are three components to what is
 
00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:43.619 align:start position:0%
floating around part A is the part of
 
00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
sb1 that we agreed to with the Senate
 
00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
with the other body
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know Part B is this amendment and
 
00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
part C are the new things that got
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
introduced in a non-germaine Amendment
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
at the last minute when Finance was
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
focusing on trying to get a a budget put
 
00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:03.950 align:start position:0%
focusing on trying to get a a budget put
together

00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
we were asked to not do that and to send
 
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
it over to the children and family law
 
00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
but for some reason we rejected that
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
very clear request
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
so part A eliminated the closure date
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
that was going to be one March so that
 
00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
was really critical gave four months of
 
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
funding it established the site
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
selection process and the obligations it
 
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
funded the site selection and it allowed
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
for two different capacities a small and
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
a medium
 
00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
this four amendment is Part B what does
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
it add it adds clinical and safety
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
guidelines this is a health care setting
 
00:57:43.069 --> 00:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
that's secure
 
00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
it agrees that we've all agreed that it
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
should be operational for 12 with a
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
maximum capacity physical capacity of
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
18. so finally the capacity thing that
 
00:57:56.569 --> 00:57:56.579 align:start position:0%
killed the committee of chaos last time
 
00:57:59.930 --> 00:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
has been resolved so that's progress
 
00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
it funds us with Federal money first it
 
00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:04.380 align:start position:0%
funds the design and construction
 
00:58:06.349 --> 00:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
because in the previous Bill there was
 
00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:08.579 align:start position:0%
no design and construction money just
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
site selection money this directs that
 
00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:13.980 align:start position:0%
the site be co-located with shared
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
services to get our operational costs
 
00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:18.170 align:start position:0%
services to get our operational costs
down

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:58:20.510 --> 00:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
um so what's the problem with with what
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
Finance passed like I said many times
 
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
it's a non-germaine Amendment In the
 
00:58:27.890 --> 00:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
Heat of the budget battle there were two
 
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
hours of debate followed by an immediate
 
00:58:33.049 --> 00:58:33.059 align:start position:0%
executive session as all of you know
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
that is not good legislative process
 
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:38.220 align:start position:0%
okay that is not the way to do it we
 
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
were asked by the community don't do
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
this send these new things over to
 
00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
children and family law children and
 
00:58:48.049 --> 00:58:48.059 align:start position:0%
family law are prepared to deal with it
 
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
um so it added dramatic changes to the
 
00:58:55.609 --> 00:58:55.619 align:start position:0%
public safety rsas Finance is not
 
00:58:58.309 --> 00:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
prepared or experienced in dealing with
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
uh the the that part of our code the
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
public safety codes so that should have
 
00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:05.540 align:start position:0%
gone to Children family law and it added
 
00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
irrelevant and damaging budget
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
benchmarks I appreciate the engineer who
 
00:59:14.030 --> 00:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
brought it forward but in the bringing
 
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
it Forward at the last minute these were
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
not the right benchmarks we we we cited
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
something called the uh prison rape
 
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
elimination act which is which is not
 
00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:29.339 align:start position:0%
appropriate to this and we also cited a
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
benchmark that said that we should use
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
the average of the nation
 
00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
we are leading the nation in what we're
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
doing the nation should be following us
 
00:59:42.109 --> 00:59:42.119 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be looking at what the
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
nation does and just be average because
 
00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
we're already beating them they need to
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
do what we're doing so that part should
 
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
not have been in there it should have
 
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
gone to Children family law
 
00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:53.809 align:start position:0%
gone to Children family law
um

00:59:53.809 --> 00:59:53.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
so in the public safety area there were
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences with what got
 
00:59:59.809 --> 00:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
offered and I heard you know the the
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
gentlelady speaking earlier talking
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
about this we all care about these kids
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
but that what will happen if we narrow
 
01:00:10.329 --> 01:00:10.339 align:start position:0%
the scope
 
01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
precipitously and without a real hearing
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to have unintended
 
01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
consequences there'll be fewer
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
diversions right now kids can be
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
diverted 72 percent of the children
 
01:00:25.849 --> 01:00:25.859 align:start position:0%
assessed by dcyf were recommended for
 
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
diversion and because this is a credible
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
process based on this this check mark or
 
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
checklist law enforcement has agreed
 
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
with that recommendation 94 percent of
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
the time so so our system is working
 
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
don't change it
 
01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
this amendment or the the one that we
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
just voted on
 
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
added that three active charges need to
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
be open at any one time to send somebody
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
to the the youth center
 
01:00:59.569 --> 01:00:59.579 align:start position:0%
think about that what what happens in
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
the real world if you have to have if
 
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
your law enforcement responsible for
 
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:07.380 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and you have to have three
 
01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
active charges that means you're not
 
01:01:14.089 --> 01:01:14.099 align:start position:0%
willing to defer charges that means you
 
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
have to push forward with as many
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
charges as you can because the kids that
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
end up at the youth center are not new
 
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:23.700 align:start position:0%
to the system
 
01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:25.980 align:start position:0%
they will be sent to the this future
 
01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
system intended by this amendment to a
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
health care setting to where their
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
behavioral and mental health needs can
 
01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
be further Ada addressed and of course
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
it's secure because some of these kids
 
01:01:40.670 --> 01:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
have done some you know are alleged to
 
01:01:43.549 --> 01:01:43.559 align:start position:0%
have done some pretty heinous things so
 
01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:45.559 align:start position:0%
it has to be secure
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
there will be fewer plea Bargains
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
because the amendment that we just voted
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
on requires a higher level of charges to
 
01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
be considered that means
 
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
the judges will be less likely to reduce
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
the charges so this is going to hurt
 
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
kids because they're going to get
 
01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
overcharged and they won't get stuff
 
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
deferred and the recommendations of dcyf
 
01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
I just want to say
 
01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
that I'm requesting you to pass this
 
01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment because it adds a
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
critical part B to what we've already
 
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
done relative to sb1 it's just
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
completing our homework finally let's do
 
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
that I would ask you to vote for this
 
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:35.220 align:start position:0%
amendment because it takes out the part
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
C to send it over to children and family
 
01:02:40.270 --> 01:02:40.280 align:start position:0%

amendment forward and also for taking my
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
question so my question is
 
01:05:59.329 --> 01:05:59.339 align:start position:0%
can you tell us how this amendment
 
01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
prevents children from being prosecuted
 
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
at higher levels
 
01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
and out of lockdown so how are we
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
preventing kids from being prosecuted at
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
higher levels through this
 
01:06:15.049 --> 01:06:15.059 align:start position:0%
so I'll I'll tell you what the experts
 
01:06:17.089 --> 01:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
the people who live and breathe in this
 
01:06:19.849 --> 01:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
space have told me to include the the
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
advocates for these kids to include the
 
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
legal system the the police and the
 
01:06:28.130 --> 01:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
judges what they had said is that if we
 
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
go with what we just voted on what will
 
01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:34.619 align:start position:0%
happen is it will because three active
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
charges are needed all of a sudden the
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
just judicial system will not want to do
 
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
what it's doing now what it's doing now
 
01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
is it's deferring charges in lieu of
 
01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:46.700 align:start position:0%
community-based services
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's pleading down charges knowing that
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
if they still need to they can get
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
somebody into the system and those are
 
01:06:57.170 --> 01:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
really the the two key things that
 
01:06:58.970 --> 01:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
happen because we have this
 
01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:01.619 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional requirement that there has
 
01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
to be three active charges for somebody
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
who may be dangerous to be sent to the
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
center so given that this is a
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic center I think we'd rather
 
01:07:13.609 --> 01:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
have some somebody who may be dangerous
 
01:07:15.289 --> 01:07:15.299 align:start position:0%
sent to where they could get some
 
01:07:17.809 --> 01:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
counseling and support and hopefully get
 
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
their lives straight before it really
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%

to treat these children differently
 
01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:31.500 align:start position:0%

already does that
 
01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:39.060 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:17.699 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that the version of
 
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
this bill as it was approved by the
 
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
finance committee uh and now approved by
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
this body a few minutes ago incorporates
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
an amendment that I proposed in
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
consultation with the representative
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
from where who was vice who served as
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
Vice chair of finance and if I know that
 
01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
that Amendment contains terms extraneous
 
01:11:39.649 --> 01:11:39.659 align:start position:0%
to what is necessary for the
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
construction and operation of a new
 
01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
Youth Development Center incorporating
 
01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
the trauma-informed care that everybody
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
agrees to and if I know that those
 
01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:52.980 align:start position:0%
extraneous terms narrow the offenses for
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
which miners may be committed to the new
 
01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:55.910 align:start position:0%
which miners may be committed to the new
facility

01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
and if I know that although the intent
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
of the proponents of these extraneous
 
01:12:03.729 --> 01:12:03.739 align:start position:0%
terms was to protect minors from
 
01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
inappropriate detention and commitment
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
at such facility
 
01:12:10.729 --> 01:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming consensus of both state
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
and local officials who work with
 
01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:15.179 align:start position:0%
children and a broad range of children's
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
Advocates groups is that the current law
 
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
regarding the crimes for which juveniles
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
may be committed is working well and has
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
resulted representative this is a
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry I'm sorry thank
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker has resulted in our
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
having the lowest number of people of
 
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
children from any state in the country
 
01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
and if I know that in drafting the
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that was ultimately adopted by
 
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
the finance committee my purpose was was
 
01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
not to Advocate that that amendment was
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
the best solution to the issues of what
 
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
crime should be the basis for commitment
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
of juveniles but was only offered as a
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
for what I would refer to as a less bad
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
alternative to an even worse program
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
than being considered by the finance
 
01:13:04.970 --> 01:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
committee and finally if I know that the
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
amend that amend that the amendment that
 
01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
is now before us proposed which was
 
01:13:11.209 --> 01:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
proposed by the representative from
 
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
Auburn makes no changes to current law
 
01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
regarding the offenses for which
 
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
juveniles May juvenile commitment may be
 
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
allowed and is supported by the police
 
01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:24.649 align:start position:0%
allowed and is supported by the police

and the overwhelming majority of
 
01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
interest groups then would I

the Department of Health and Human

functioning and following CDC mandates

but the department is not set up to do
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
the proper risk benefit analysis for
 
01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:52.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:55.580 align:start position:0%
the department

relies on federal statistics
 
01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:05.900 align:start position:0%
currently last week for example cgc
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
confirmed that covet vaccine caused
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
stroke department tells us that covet
 
01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
vaccine caused myocarditis but they
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
still still come to us and ask to
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
promote this vaccination
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh four times more kids that in New
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire following the covet vaccines
 
01:17:32.770 --> 01:17:32.780 align:start position:0%
and after Corvette

Massachusetts death certificates show
 
01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:37.149 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts death certificates show
that

01:17:37.149 --> 01:17:37.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:41.300 align:start position:0%
tachycardia cardiac arrested
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
are all up more concerning that slow
 
01:17:49.010 --> 01:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
developing diseases like plutonium and
 
01:17:51.669 --> 01:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
life node cancers are continually
 
01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:54.980 align:start position:0%
increasing following the death toll
 
01:17:59.630 --> 01:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
after the covet vaccine so why it's
 
01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:00.790 align:start position:0%
after the covet vaccine so why it's
happening

01:18:00.790 --> 01:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:18:06.169 --> 01:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
uh uh seven year old south of Nashua a
 
01:18:08.689 --> 01:18:08.699 align:start position:0%
girl received covet vaccine and then
 
01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
five minutes she began throwing out and
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
she was going out for uh eight to ten
 
01:18:15.239 --> 01:18:16.370 align:start position:0%
she was going out for uh eight to ten
hours

01:18:16.370 --> 01:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
despite that it was not reported despite
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
that when she became better and time
 
01:18:25.850 --> 01:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
came they administered the second shot
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
severe pain vomiting 103 degree fever
 
01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:34.219 align:start position:0%
five days after the second shot she died
 
01:18:37.729 --> 01:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
will her desk help the department to
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
make the right decision unfortunately
 
01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
not because on the death certificate
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
they didn't put
 
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
the right reason of course that was
 
01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
covered vaccine they put should date of
 
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
covet the girl who had immediate
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
reaction to the first shot and immediate
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
reaction for the second shot
 
01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
and there are a thousand cases like that
 
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
that's why Department continue his
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
promotion of vaccine
 
01:19:10.030 --> 01:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh and uh
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
we are being told that
 
01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
The Professional
 
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately professionals are
 
01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:20.699 align:start position:0%
threatened to lose their license if they
 
01:19:23.209 --> 01:19:23.219 align:start position:0%
tell anything that causes vaccine
 
01:19:23.219 --> 01:19:24.830 align:start position:0%
tell anything that causes vaccine
hesitancy

01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
hesitancy
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
so the department just is not in a good
 
01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:28.930 align:start position:0%
so the department just is not in a good
position

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:28.940 align:start position:0%

to make decisions in in future and
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's why I ask you to support this
 
01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:44.390 align:start position:0%
that's why I ask you to support this

all
um

01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
House Bill 557 essentially removes the
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
rule-making authority of the
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner of DHHS
 
01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
for immunization requirements Beyond
 
01:20:22.010 --> 01:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
those diseases already identified in
 
01:20:22.020 --> 01:20:23.270 align:start position:0%
those diseases already identified in
statute

01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
it is an attempt to eliminate through
 
01:20:26.450 --> 01:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
the removal of the commissioner's
 
01:20:29.149 --> 01:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
Authority recommendations from subject
 
01:20:30.970 --> 01:20:30.980 align:start position:0%
matter experts in the field of medicine
 
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
and vaccine science when establishing
 
01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
solid Public Health
 
01:20:35.940 --> 01:20:37.250 align:start position:0%
solid Public Health

01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
policies
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
this bill would take away the necessary
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility of the commissioner who
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
needs to make real-time decisions
 
01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
regarding Public Health threats
 
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
removing the Commissioners rule making
 
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
Authority may result in the delayed
 
01:20:52.490 --> 01:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
response to address imminent threats to
 
01:20:54.169 --> 01:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
the health of New Hampshire school
 
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
children in our communities
 
01:20:58.370 --> 01:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
it is important to remember
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
that during the early stages of the
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
covid pandemic the legislature did not
 
01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
meet and without the Commissioners
 
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:06.110 align:start position:0%
meet and without the Commissioners
judicious

01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
judicious
 
01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
And Timely authority to act the health
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
of our children and communities would
 
01:21:12.890 --> 01:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
have been compromised
 
01:21:14.990 --> 01:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
preventing the spread of diseases in our
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
schools in our child care programs is a
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
vital Public Health function best
 
01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
protected by keeping rule-making
 
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
Authority for immunization requirements
 
01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:27.659 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner of DHHS the
 
01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
commissioner and DHS DHHS engage with a
 
01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
broad spectrum of clinical and
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
infectious disease experts and policy
 
01:21:39.649 --> 01:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
makers in a very transparent process
 
01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:43.260 align:start position:0%
which includes input from the public and
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
legislature when considering adding or
 
01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
removing vaccine requirements these
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
decisions to add or remove vaccines are
 
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
made very infrequently and then made
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
only after extensive discussions with
 
01:21:59.630 --> 01:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
all appropriate Health Care Experts the
 
01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
legislature and the public
 
01:22:04.310 --> 01:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
these decisions are not made in
 
01:22:07.010 --> 01:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
isolation this process is a deliberative
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
and thoughtful one
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
with only one goal in mind the public
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
health safety and well-being of all
 
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters
 
01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
actually the last time a vaccine was
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
added to the school list of required
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines was in 2003 and that was for
 
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
varicella which is commonly known known
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
as chickenpox and the department has
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
repeatedly stated
 
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
that it has no intention of adding
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine or influenza vaccines
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
for school and child care attendance
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's also important to remember
 
01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
that the commissioner's Authority does
 
01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
have oversight previous legislation
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
established the ethics oversight
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
advisory committee this committee was
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
designed to offer guidance to the
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner related to ethical issues
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
relevant to the planning and responsive
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases including
 
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.169 align:start position:0%
communicable diseases including
immunizations

01:23:03.169 --> 01:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
immunizations
 
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
should the commissioner
 
01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
in his or her team of experts consider
 
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
changes to the list of immunizations the
 
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
ethics oversight advisory committee
 
01:23:14.090 --> 01:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
which is made up of members of both this
 
01:23:15.709 --> 01:23:15.719 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate
 
01:23:17.930 --> 01:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
would need to convene to rec to review
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
any recommendations
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
lastly by allowing rules requiring
 
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
varicella Hepatitis B homophilus
 
01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
influenza type B vaccines to expire in
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
June of 2026
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
may have severe consequences for the
 
01:23:35.570 --> 01:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
health of our children and the staff
 
01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
that attend child care in school all
 
01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:40.260 align:start position:0%
three of these diseases are highly
 
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:42.440 align:start position:0%
contagious and infectious in school
 
01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
school-aged children and in severe cases
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
can result in permanent disability or
 
01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
even death
 
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:51.719 align:start position:0%
this would actually leave New Hampshire
 
01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
as the only state in the nation that
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
does not have a requirement for
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
varicella or hemophilus influenza B
 
01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:01.189 align:start position:0%
varicella or hemophilus influenza B
vaccines

01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
the existing Statute in responding and
 
01:24:05.810 --> 01:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
corresponding administrative rules are
 
01:24:08.290 --> 01:24:08.300 align:start position:0%
appropriate for allowing external input
 
01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
reinforcing the relationship between
 
01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
executive and legislative powers to
 
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
balance and protect parental choice
 
01:24:17.689 --> 01:24:17.699 align:start position:0%
and protect the health of all children
 
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
enrolled in New Hampshire schools and
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
day care facilities
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
colleagues I appreciate that this bill
 
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
may have been in response to the covet
 
01:24:30.290 --> 01:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
pandemic but to insist that the entire
 
01:24:33.169 --> 01:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
legislature with no medical expertise
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
would emergently convene during a an
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
emerging Public Health crisis in order
 
01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
to decide an appropriate course of
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
action would delay and compromise the
 
01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
health of many children and our
 
01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:46.790 align:start position:0%
health of many children and our
communities

01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
I am a physician and I practiced
 
01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
Orthopedics for orthopedic surgery in
 
01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
this state for 40 years
 
01:24:57.290 --> 01:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
however I do not feel that I have the
 
01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
requisite Baseline clinical knowledge
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
nor do I want or seek the legislative
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
authority to make critical decisions
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
regarding vaccine policy
 
01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
infectious disease management in the
 
01:25:12.169 --> 01:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
middle of an epidemic or public health
 
01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
decisions of any consequence therefore I
 
01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote no on the ought to pass
 
01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
motion so that these decisions are left
 
01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
to the subject matter experts the member
 
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
will suspend for a minute
 
01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
it's getting awful loud in here the
 
01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
member has a right to be heard if you
 
01:25:30.169 --> 01:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
have to have a conversation take it out
 
01:25:31.729 --> 01:25:31.739 align:start position:0%
into any room
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
remember they continue
 
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and I asked for a
 
01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.090 --> 01:25:59.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker for your thought
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
representative representative Senator
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
nataso has requested a roll call
 
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
it's not sufficiently seconded yet but I
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
would assume we're going to have one so
 
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
members start taking your seats quietly
 
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
remember may continue
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker the issue of whether an
 
01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
executive and state government should
 
01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
have extensive ability for discretionary
 
01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
action it's been one of great debate in
 
01:26:27.649 --> 01:26:27.659 align:start position:0%
this chamber over the last few years
 
01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
this is understandable
 
01:26:31.610 --> 01:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
on the one hand dangerous and uncertain
 
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
times do require a need for government
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
to respond quickly and efficiently
 
01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.290 align:start position:0%
to respond quickly and efficiently
however

01:26:39.290 --> 01:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:26:41.689 --> 01:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
it is the concern over executive
 
01:26:44.110 --> 01:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
Authority that gave rise to our nation
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
247 years ago
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
the debate about how much Authority an
 
01:26:50.689 --> 01:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
executive should have and how and when
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
they should be able to exercise it will
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
be a debate full of the legislative and
 
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
judicial branches of government to
 
01:26:59.570 --> 01:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
engage in well beyond the time that any
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
of us will be sitting here
 
01:27:05.090 --> 01:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
there's a 23-year employee of the New
 
01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
Services who served under the
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
administrations of six different
 
01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I know that each of them
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
strive to do their best for our state
 
01:27:19.129 --> 01:27:19.139 align:start position:0%
they acted and did seek the advice of
 
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
those around them
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
what we must consider as we vote for
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
this bill however is that public health
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
concerns need to be vetted by more than
 
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
a small select group
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
our state constitution established the
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
legislative branch of government as the
 
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
first Branch for an important reason
 
01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:39.780 align:start position:0%
it was because it is the most
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative branch of government and
 
01:27:44.570 --> 01:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
that branch of government closest to the
 
01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:45.709 align:start position:0%
that branch of government closest to the
people

01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
it is also the most powerful
 
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
without us and the legislation which
 
01:27:52.330 --> 01:27:52.340 align:start position:0%
originates here and across the hall
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
nothing else tends to happen
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
almost everything in state government
 
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
begins and ends here
 
01:28:03.290 --> 01:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker it is entirely appropriate
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
that the legislature make the very
 
01:28:08.209 --> 01:28:08.219 align:start position:0%
important decision on immunizations and
 
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
the extent of the authority of the
 
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
executive in this case the commissioner
 
01:28:14.209 --> 01:28:14.219 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Health and Human
 
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
Services and I therefore urge our
 
01:28:19.129 --> 01:28:19.139 align:start position:0%
colleagues to vote green for ought to
 
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
he was in San Antonio has requested a
 
01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
roll call
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
is that sufficiently seconded it is
 
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded this will be a
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:26.750 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:35.149 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the honor pass
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation on hb557 this is a roll
 
01:29:43.129 --> 01:29:43.139 align:start position:0%
call vote share recognized
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy for a
 
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
preventing the spread of diseases in our
 
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
schools in child care programs is a
 
01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
vital Public Health function best
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
protected by keeping the rule-making
 
01:30:05.209 --> 01:30:05.219 align:start position:0%
Authority for immunization requirements
 
01:30:07.729 --> 01:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner of DHHS in his
 
01:30:09.890 --> 01:30:09.900 align:start position:0%
expert team and if I know that this bill
 
01:30:11.090 --> 01:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
would take away the necessary
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility of the commissioner who
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
needs to make real-time decisions in
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
consultation with subject matter experts
 
01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
in the field of medicine in vaccine
 
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
science in order to protect the public
 
01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
health safety and well-being of all
 
01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
granite stateers
 
01:30:27.290 --> 01:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that allowing the
 
01:30:29.709 --> 01:30:29.719 align:start position:0%
rules requiring varicella chickenpox
 
01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:32.340 align:start position:0%

Peterborough for that one
 
01:36:35.209 --> 01:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
that's on you
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you HB 575 is a cut and dry bill
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
it says the state of New Hampshire shall
 
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
not distribute or advertise any
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical product or immunization
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
which has not been clinically tested
 
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
with voluntary human clinical trials
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
I support this legislation because we
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
have a pharmaceutical industry which has
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
been caught time and time again
 
01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
mishandling the life-saving drugs
 
01:37:04.010 --> 01:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
treatments and immunizations given to
 
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
the general population
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%
the industry has shelled out hundreds of
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars and Anti-Trust fines
 
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
been caught knowingly over over
 
01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
prescribing incredibly addictive drugs
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
which have destroyed our communities
 
01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:20.219 align:start position:0%
broken up our families and left us
 
01:37:23.209 --> 01:37:23.219 align:start position:0%
drugged out and dumb they have caught
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
they have been caught rushing drugs
 
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
through the trial process bluffing about
 
01:37:31.010 --> 01:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
the tests carried out and a whole host
 
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
of actions which prove that these are an
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
industry that this is an industry which
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
is not to be trusted
 
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
so why should we not require the
 
01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:42.060 align:start position:0%
products they give our state to be
 
01:37:44.110 --> 01:37:44.120 align:start position:0%
distributed to be tested
 
01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:47.340 align:start position:0%
voluntarily tested on human beings
 
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
we are in a situation right now where
 
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
products being distributed with our name
 
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
on it as a state have been tested only
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
on mice
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
I do not feel comfortable with the state
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
Distributing products where the efficacy
 
01:38:03.890 --> 01:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
has not adequately been tested
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
this does not ban the distribution of a
 
01:38:09.410 --> 01:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
drug not tested if you still want a
 
01:38:11.450 --> 01:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
product from a company with a record
 
01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:13.860 align:start position:0%
such as Pharma does that has only been
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
tested on mice shall be it you can take
 
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
that product
 
01:38:20.930 --> 01:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
and the companies will definitely still
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
be Distributing it it simply says the
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
state will not distribute or advertise
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
products not adequately tested for these
 
01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
companies now some of the fear-mongering
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
by my friends in opposition to this bill
 
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
is unfounded
 
01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
we heard that you wouldn't be able to
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
get the flu vaccine anymore because it
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
isn't tested every year
 
01:38:43.850 --> 01:38:43.860 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is the base of
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
the flu vaccine was tested using human
 
01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
clinical trials and unless we used a
 
01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
completely new vaccine
 
01:38:54.410 --> 01:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
this would apply this wouldn't apply to
 
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
that bill therefore the state could
 
01:38:59.570 --> 01:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
distribute the flu vaccine as much as it
 
01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
wanted to it's been tested using human
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
clinical trials the flu vaccine will
 
01:39:06.290 --> 01:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
still be available at your local
 
01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
drugstore all of these vaccines will
 
01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
still be available I think a simple
 
01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:11.810 align:start position:0%
still be available I think a simple
regulation

01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
01:39:13.610 --> 01:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
to the pharmaceutical industry which
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
time and time again has proven its
 
01:39:18.770 --> 01:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
criminality a simple regulation saying
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
that you must test your drugs with
 
01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
voluntary human clinical trials is a
 
01:39:26.689 --> 01:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
basic and bipartisan thing that I think
 
01:39:28.250 --> 01:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
all of us should be able to agree on in
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that this conversation has
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
become so partisan is a sad State of
 
01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
Affairs thank you Mr Speaker and I ask
 
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:37.639 align:start position:0%
you to vote with me for this bill
 
01:39:41.390 --> 01:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order
 
01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill 575 would prohibit the state
 
01:39:59.570 --> 01:39:59.580 align:start position:0%
in its political subdivisions from
 
01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:02.340 align:start position:0%
purchasing promoting or Distributing any
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine or pharmaceutical product that
 
01:40:07.129 --> 01:40:07.139 align:start position:0%
has not been tested with quote voluntary
 
01:40:09.229 --> 01:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
human clinical trials
 
01:40:11.229 --> 01:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
if enacted it would have potentially
 
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
wide-ranging and negative unintended
 
01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:15.169 align:start position:0%
wide-ranging and negative unintended
consequences

01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:15.179 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
first of all the wording in the proposed
 
01:40:20.570 --> 01:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
legislation is vague with very unclear
 
01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:21.830 align:start position:0%
legislation is vague with very unclear
intent

01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
human Clinical Trials come in very much
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
very different forms of studies focusing
 
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes on the safety of
 
01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical products while Others May
 
01:40:34.370 --> 01:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
deal with measuring effectiveness
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
there are also different ways to measure
 
01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:38.149 align:start position:0%
there are also different ways to measure
effectiveness

01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
effectiveness
 
01:40:41.450 --> 01:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 575 also mandates quote
 
01:40:43.729 --> 01:40:43.739 align:start position:0%
voluntary human trials
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
I would have you know that as specified
 
01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
in federal law the use of involuntary
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
human subjects in clinical trials is
 
01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
prohibited and considered unethical and
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
therefore the use of voluntary in the
 
01:40:58.729 --> 01:40:58.739 align:start position:0%
context of a human clinical trial
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
requirement is inappropriate and
 
01:41:00.719 --> 01:41:02.390 align:start position:0%
requirement is inappropriate and
unnecessary

01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
mandating a new clinical trial for the
 
01:41:07.490 --> 01:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
periodically updated flu in pneumococcal
 
01:41:09.950 --> 01:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
vaccines would delay their timely
 
01:41:11.689 --> 01:41:11.699 align:start position:0%
availability for children and adults
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
resulted in increased morbidity in
 
01:41:13.679 --> 01:41:15.169 align:start position:0%
resulted in increased morbidity in
mortality

01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:15.179 align:start position:0%
mortality
 
01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
this routine process for updating these
 
01:41:20.750 --> 01:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines is very similar to that which
 
01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
was done during the initial bivalent
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine rollout and was proven to be
 
01:41:27.050 --> 01:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
very effective and safe
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
this bill would also lead
 
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
to increase costs for some of the
 
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccines you may not know this
 
01:41:37.129 --> 01:41:37.139 align:start position:0%
but the New Hampshire DHHS is currently
 
01:41:40.070 --> 01:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
able to purchase childhood vaccines
 
01:41:44.209 --> 01:41:44.219 align:start position:0%
at a reduced cost through the vfc
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
program the vaccines for children
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
program which are then distributed to
 
01:41:50.450 --> 01:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
health care providers so that the cost
 
01:41:52.729 --> 01:41:52.739 align:start position:0%
of these vaccines can be minimized for
 
01:41:52.739 --> 01:41:53.990 align:start position:0%
of these vaccines can be minimized for
families

01:41:53.990 --> 01:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
if the New Hampshire DHHS and other
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
partners were unable to promote purchase
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
and distribute these vaccines than cost
 
01:42:04.129 --> 01:42:04.139 align:start position:0%
to individuals communities and the
 
01:42:05.689 --> 01:42:05.699 align:start position:0%
overall health care System would
 
01:42:05.699 --> 01:42:07.250 align:start position:0%
overall health care System would
increase

01:42:07.250 --> 01:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
another unfortunate in unintended
 
01:42:12.530 --> 01:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
consequence would be the effect on the
 
01:42:15.250 --> 01:42:15.260 align:start position:0%
FDA provision known as expanded access
 
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
commonly known as compassionate use
 
01:42:20.689 --> 01:42:20.699 align:start position:0%
for those that do not know compassionate
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
use is a mechanism that we use to allow
 
01:42:25.850 --> 01:42:25.860 align:start position:0%
patients with serious or immediately
 
01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
life-threatening diseases to have access
 
01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
to Medical Products including drugs
 
01:42:33.290 --> 01:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
vaccines and biologics
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
these are products that are still
 
01:42:37.370 --> 01:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
enrolled in clinical trials but in
 
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
certain desperate circumstances can be
 
01:42:41.689 --> 01:42:41.699 align:start position:0%
used under compassionate use after
 
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
meeting certain criteria
 
01:42:46.970 --> 01:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
a mild lateral School ALS
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
Muscular Dystrophy and certain cancers
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
are examples of this use lastly
 
01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
one of the most significant consequences
 
01:42:56.530 --> 01:42:56.540 align:start position:0%
of this legislation is that
 
01:42:59.450 --> 01:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
DHHS would not be able to purchase and
 
01:43:01.570 --> 01:43:01.580 align:start position:0%
distribute many of these routinely
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
recommended and life-saving vaccines
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
in other medical therapies to those
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
living in congregate settings like
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
Correctional Facilities nursing homes
 
01:43:13.010 --> 01:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
and mental health institutions
 
01:43:15.290 --> 01:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
those living in these facilities are at
 
01:43:16.970 --> 01:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
significantly increased risk for
 
01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
contagious diseases and this would lead
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
to increased morbidity mortality and
 
01:43:21.239 --> 01:43:23.030 align:start position:0%
to increased morbidity mortality and
suffering

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
suffering
 
01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
colleagues the wording intent of HB 575
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
is vague and unclear and the unintended
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
consequences noted here would lead to
 
01:43:34.669 --> 01:43:34.679 align:start position:0%
compromised access to life-saving
 
01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
vaccines and other Therapeutics and will
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
likely increase health care costs I urge
 
01:43:42.410 --> 01:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
you to vote Yes on the I.T motion itl
 
01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
motion and I request a division vote
 
01:43:45.890 --> 01:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:48.169 --> 01:43:48.179 align:start position:0%
just remember yielded questions
 
01:43:50.810 --> 01:43:50.820 align:start position:0%

sufficiently seconded
 
01:43:56.689 --> 01:43:56.699 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be

01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote chair
 
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
recognized representative Phillips for
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
if I know that informed consent is the
 
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
foundation of a fair Health Care System
 
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
would I support this legislation
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
and if I know that today we as
 
01:45:30.890 --> 01:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
legislators can send a clear message
 
01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
that we will protect Granite Staters
 
01:45:35.149 --> 01:45:35.159 align:start position:0%
from becoming guinea pigs for big
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
pharma's future experiments and that
 
01:45:40.490 --> 01:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
products tested on mice only
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
are not proven safe and effective enough
 
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire
 
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
and if I know that taxpayers should not
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
be funding vaccine advertisements and
 
01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
that the state of New Hampshire should
 
01:45:54.770 --> 01:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
leave promotion of pharmaceutical
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
products to the industry itself
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
lastly Mr Speaker if I trust science
 
01:46:04.129 --> 01:46:04.139 align:start position:0%
would I press the red button so that
 
01:46:08.810 --> 01:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
sure I recognize you have sent Murphy
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.890 --> 01:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
know that mandating a new clinical trial
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
annually for the periodically updated
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
fluent pneumococcal vaccines would
 
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
significantly delay their timely
 
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
availability for children and adults
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
resulting in increased morbidity in
 
01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:37.250 align:start position:0%
resulting in increased morbidity in
mortality

01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
mortality
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill would lead
 
01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:41.159 align:start position:0%
to higher patient costs for some
 
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccines that are now
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
purchased and distributed by DHHS at a
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
reduced cost through our vaccines for
 
01:46:49.250 --> 01:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
children program
 
01:46:50.810 --> 01:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill would
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
negatively impact the fda's
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
compassionate use program intended to
 
01:46:56.930 --> 01:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
allow patients
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
with serious and immediately
 
01:47:00.410 --> 01:47:00.420 align:start position:0%

01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
to Medical Products including drugs and
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines and finally if I know that this
 
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
bill would compromise dhh's dhhs's
 
01:47:11.530 --> 01:47:11.540 align:start position:0%
ability to purchase and distribute
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
life-saving vaccines and other medical
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
therapies to those living in congregate
 
01:47:18.649 --> 01:47:18.659 align:start position:0%
settings who are at significantly
 
01:47:21.050 --> 01:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
increased risk for contagious diseases
 
01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
what I now push green on the motion to

I rise in opposition to the committee
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
report in expedient to legislate on
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 582.
 
01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 582 has nothing to do with
 
01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
prying into private medical records of
 
01:51:56.090 --> 01:51:56.100 align:start position:0%
anyone and in fact House Bill 582 isn't
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
much different than a highway accident
 
01:51:59.810 --> 01:51:59.820 align:start position:0%
statistics study
 
01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
where the accidents happen under what
 
01:52:04.370 --> 01:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
conditions and leading to how can we cut
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
over the last few decades New Hampshire
 
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have funded the Family
 
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
Planning program to the tune of several
 
01:52:15.470 --> 01:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:52:18.410 --> 01:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
what was essentially been doing is the
 
01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
equivalent of throwing money into the
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
if we use some of the Family Planning
 
01:52:30.169 --> 01:52:30.179 align:start position:0%
funds to educate teens both male and
 
01:52:31.370 --> 01:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
female now
 
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
about the consequences of unprotected
 
01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:34.609 align:start position:0%
about the consequences of unprotected
sex

01:52:34.609 --> 01:52:34.619 align:start position:0%
sex
 
01:52:36.770 --> 01:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
we may just save them from the lifelong
 
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
mental anguish that many experience
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:45.410 --> 01:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
I had a close family close family member
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
to spent 28 years suffering from a
 
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
burning guilt as a result of an abortion
 
01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
at the age of 14.
 
01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
she had multiple suicide attempts
 
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
was institutionalized roughly 10 times
 
01:52:59.149 --> 01:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
along with suffering from chronic and
 
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
severe alcoholism and drug addiction
 
01:53:05.090 --> 01:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
she died at the age of 42 from uterine
 
01:53:08.330 --> 01:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
cancer but in her own words
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
the doctors might have found that found
 
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
the cancer in time if they if they if I
 
01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
had gotten my butt off the off the bar
 
01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:15.410 align:start position:0%
had gotten my butt off the off the bar
stool

01:53:15.410 --> 01:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
stool
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
you see uterine cancer is is commonly
 
01:53:21.590 --> 01:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
cured if found in time
 
01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
the combination of guilt and alcoholism
 
01:53:26.810 --> 01:53:26.820 align:start position:0%
killed her just as much as cancer
 
01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
as legislators we have an obligation to
 
01:53:30.649 --> 01:53:30.659 align:start position:0%
help young young women the young women
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and do all we can to
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
collect Anonymous information
 
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
so the tragedy of of post-abortion guilt
 
01:53:41.330 --> 01:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
and all its horrific implications
 
01:53:43.129 --> 01:53:43.139 align:start position:0%
can be minimized or possibly even
 
01:53:45.410 --> 01:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
avoided altogether
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
former President Bill Clinton once said
 
01:53:51.709 --> 01:53:51.719 align:start position:0%
abortions should be accessible and rare
 
01:53:53.270 --> 01:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire needs the information that
 
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 582 will provide in order to
 
01:53:58.310 --> 01:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
in order to fulfill the latter part of
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:05.689 --> 01:54:05.699 align:start position:0%
in conclusion House Bill 582
 
01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
is the anonymous Gathering of data
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
data that will help the young women of
 
01:54:11.330 --> 01:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
and again any statements the contrary
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
please press the red button to overturn
 
01:54:24.169 --> 01:54:24.179 align:start position:0%
the committee recommendation of an
 
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
expense in expedient to legislate so
 
01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made
 
01:54:30.649 --> 01:54:30.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:46.129 --> 01:54:46.139 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill
 
01:54:48.290 --> 01:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
will prevent
 
01:54:51.770 --> 01:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
what the bill will do
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
is that it will require providers of
 
01:55:00.649 --> 01:55:00.659 align:start position:0%
induced termination of pregnancy to
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%

01:55:13.729 --> 01:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
a magical procedure that is legal
 
01:55:17.629 --> 01:55:17.639 align:start position:0%

that's pretty personal information
 
01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
and this is a small state and

the collection and transmission of this

that that data can be re-identified and
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%

change that
 
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%

how that would be defined
 
01:57:29.209 --> 01:57:29.219 align:start position:0%
but the facts remain first of all
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
this data is personal
 
01:57:34.669 --> 01:57:34.679 align:start position:0%
and second if the data sought is to be
 
01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
used for statistical and public health
 
01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:38.390 align:start position:0%
used for statistical and public health
purposes

01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
if it was voluntary
 
01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
the data wouldn't be complete and
 
01:57:46.370 --> 01:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:46.380 --> 01:57:48.050 align:start position:0%
 
finally

01:57:48.050 --> 01:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:57:50.350 --> 01:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
if import forming Public Health
 
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
decisions is the goal
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
the majority notes that this kind of
 
01:57:57.109 --> 01:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
information is not collected about other

01:58:17.570 --> 01:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
what could possibly go wrong
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
think about data collection think about
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr speaker thank you for

taking my question I'm wondering if you
 
01:58:46.609 --> 01:58:46.619 align:start position:0%
have any idea how many states do not
 
01:58:47.890 --> 01:58:47.900 align:start position:0%

01:58:55.250 --> 01:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
as we have often been told here this is
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:58:59.770 --> 01:58:59.780 align:start position:0%
and we do things the New Hampshire way
 
01:59:01.640 --> 01:59:01.650 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order
 
01:59:01.650 --> 01:59:11.330 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order

01:59:11.330 --> 01:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:13.609 --> 01:59:13.619 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
01:59:15.350 --> 01:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
committee report of inexpeding to
 
01:59:18.589 --> 01:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 582.
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question division
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
has been requested members take your
 
01:59:22.560 --> 02:00:15.649 align:start position:0%
has been requested members take your
seats

02:00:15.649 --> 02:00:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.629 --> 02:00:17.639 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
02:00:19.010 --> 02:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
committee report of index fee to
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
legislative House Bill 582 this is a
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
division vote the chair recognized
 
02:00:23.810 --> 02:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
representative lay on for a
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry the house will be
 
02:00:27.770 --> 02:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
in order
 
02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know today
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
that the only people who have statistics
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
on abortions in New Hampshire are the
 
02:00:38.629 --> 02:00:38.639 align:start position:0%
abortion providers
 
02:00:40.910 --> 02:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
and if I believe that the legislature
 
02:00:43.250 --> 02:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
could better allocate Family Planning
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
dollars if we had access to anonymized
 
02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:47.930 align:start position:0%
dollars if we had access to anonymized
data

02:00:47.930 --> 02:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
and if I know that by overturning this
 
02:00:52.910 --> 02:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
itl motion we will have the opportunity
 
02:00:55.970 --> 02:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
to consider language on page 92 that
 
02:00:57.830 --> 02:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
would allow us to provide information
 
02:01:01.070 --> 02:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
requested by the CDC and allow women to
 
02:01:04.129 --> 02:01:04.139 align:start position:0%
volunteer the reason why they were led
 
02:01:06.410 --> 02:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
to a decision that they wish they never
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:16.790 --> 02:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
and then finally Mr Speaker if I know
 
02:01:19.250 --> 02:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
that the only way that we can live up to
 
02:01:21.649 --> 02:01:21.659 align:start position:0%
presidents Clinton's desire for
 
02:01:25.129 --> 02:01:25.139 align:start position:0%
accessible and rare abortions is to be
 
02:01:27.890 --> 02:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
able to know how often we've reached
 
02:01:30.530 --> 02:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
this point would I then press at the red
 
02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
button thank you
 
02:01:39.709 --> 02:01:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.310 --> 02:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
Mr if I know
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
that the reasons that I have reached
 
02:01:55.490 --> 02:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:57.709 --> 02:01:57.719 align:start position:0%
are none of my health care providers

02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:01.609 align:start position:0%

business

02:02:01.609 --> 02:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
business
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
and if I know that that applies to every
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
single medical procedure that every
 
02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
single one of us undergoes
 
02:02:15.649 --> 02:02:15.659 align:start position:0%
would I now vote red to preserve the
 
02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
privacy of every single one of us the
 
02:02:22.250 --> 02:02:22.260 align:start position:0%

02:07:58.010 --> 02:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment that would
 
02:08:00.169 --> 02:08:00.179 align:start position:0%
establish a constitutional right to
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
quote reproductive autonomy
 
02:08:04.970 --> 02:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
and provide that such right could not be
 
02:08:07.910 --> 02:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
denied or infringed unless justified by
 
02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
a compelling State interest achieved by
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
the least restrictive means
 
02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
the proponents of this measure
 
02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
say that all it does is let the voters
 
02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
decide if there should be a right to
 
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
reproductive autonomy and ask how could
 
02:08:25.850 --> 02:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
anyone be opposed to that
 
02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
let the voters decide is a great sound
 
02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:29.990 align:start position:0%
let the voters decide is a great sound
bite

02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
bite
 
02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
which has a certain amount of simplistic
 
02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:33.950 align:start position:0%
which has a certain amount of simplistic
appeal

02:08:33.950 --> 02:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
02:08:36.350 --> 02:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
but look a bit more carefully and you
 
02:08:38.209 --> 02:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
will see that what the voters are really
 
02:08:40.609 --> 02:08:40.619 align:start position:0%
being asked to decide is completely
 
02:08:40.619 --> 02:08:42.410 align:start position:0%
being asked to decide is completely
unclear

02:08:42.410 --> 02:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
unclear
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
if this amendment were adopted what
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
exactly would be the Contours of the
 
02:08:51.530 --> 02:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
right to quote reproductive autonomy
 
02:08:54.050 --> 02:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
would such a right allow abortions up to
 
02:08:56.330 --> 02:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
the moment of birth
 
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
up until a pregnancy progressed to 24
 
02:09:01.609 --> 02:09:01.619 align:start position:0%
weeks and even beyond that in limited
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances as provided in our current
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
fetal Life protection act
 
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
up to 15 weeks
 
02:09:11.330 --> 02:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
or up until detection of a fetal
 
02:09:11.340 --> 02:09:12.950 align:start position:0%
or up until detection of a fetal
heartbeat

02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
heartbeat
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
when along this Continuum with the
 
02:09:17.570 --> 02:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
state's interest in protecting life
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
become compelling
 
02:09:22.070 --> 02:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
and what kinds of regulations would be
 
02:09:25.729 --> 02:09:25.739 align:start position:0%
considered the least restrictive means
 
02:09:29.689 --> 02:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
the proponents of cacr2 acknowledge that
 
02:09:31.970 --> 02:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
they have no answers to any of these
 
02:09:31.980 --> 02:09:33.290 align:start position:0%
they have no answers to any of these
questions

02:09:33.290 --> 02:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:09:36.589 --> 02:09:36.599 align:start position:0%
so who would determine the questions
 
02:09:38.689 --> 02:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
the obvious answer is the New Hampshire
 
02:09:41.209 --> 02:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court which is the ultimate
 
02:09:43.490 --> 02:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
Arbiter of what the state constitution
 
02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:45.169 align:start position:0%
Arbiter of what the state constitution
means

02:09:45.169 --> 02:09:45.179 align:start position:0%
means
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
but what will the Court's answer be to
 
02:09:51.649 --> 02:09:51.659 align:start position:0%
any of these questions we have no idea
 
02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
for example
 
02:09:57.229 --> 02:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me for example some judges May
 
02:09:59.149 --> 02:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
believe that protecting fetal life after
 
02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
24 weeks is a compelling interest
 
02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
while other judges may not and still
 
02:10:06.830 --> 02:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
other judges may think that the state's
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
compelling the state's interest becomes
 
02:10:12.169 --> 02:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
compelling earlier than 24 weeks and
 
02:10:13.729 --> 02:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
since the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
has never previously addressed abortion
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
issues under the state constitution
 
02:10:22.550 --> 02:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
it will be ruling largely from a clean
 
02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:24.229 align:start position:0%
it will be ruling largely from a clean
slate

02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
slate
 
02:10:27.229 --> 02:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
what all this means of course is that by
 
02:10:29.450 --> 02:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
passing this cacr
 
02:10:32.030 --> 02:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
we will effectively be throwing up our
 
02:10:35.209 --> 02:10:35.219 align:start position:0%
hands and saying hey Court this issue is
 
02:10:37.669 --> 02:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
too tough for us to decide you take care
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
if the proponents of this amendment are
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
concerned about protecting Reproductive
 
02:10:45.950 --> 02:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
Rights from being infringed by the
 
02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:47.209 align:start position:0%
Rights from being infringed by the
legislature

02:10:47.209 --> 02:10:47.219 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
they could easily have proposed the
 
02:10:51.290 --> 02:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment that would have
 
02:10:53.149 --> 02:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
that would have had real meaning
 
02:10:54.890 --> 02:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
for example if they believe a woman
 
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
should have an unrestricted right to
 
02:10:58.729 --> 02:10:58.739 align:start position:0%
abortion up until birth they could have
 
02:11:00.830 --> 02:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
drafted a constitutional amendment to
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
say just that
 
02:11:04.729 --> 02:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
instead they have proposed an amendment
 
02:11:06.770 --> 02:11:06.780 align:start position:0%
with the uninformative language we have
 
02:11:08.209 --> 02:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
before us
 
02:11:10.550 --> 02:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
which of course allows them to say in
 
02:11:13.370 --> 02:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
their report on the bill that if adopted
 
02:11:16.729 --> 02:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
it would quote not necessarily conflict
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
with the free-to-life protection act
 
02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
I respectfully submit that if this
 
02:11:23.930 --> 02:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
amendment were to become law The
 
02:11:26.570 --> 02:11:26.580 align:start position:0%
Advocates of of abortion on demand to
 
02:11:28.970 --> 02:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
the moment of birth would be at the
 
02:11:31.609 --> 02:11:31.619 align:start position:0%
courthouse door challenging the fetal
 
02:11:33.649 --> 02:11:33.659 align:start position:0%
Life protection act in the blink of an
 
02:11:33.659 --> 02:11:34.970 align:start position:0%
Life protection act in the blink of an
eye

02:11:34.970 --> 02:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
eye
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
but is there any reason to believe that
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
the court is somehow
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
to make decisions on these issues than
 
02:11:45.109 --> 02:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
we are I submit to you that the answer
 
02:11:46.370 --> 02:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
is no
 
02:11:49.669 --> 02:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
and on this point let me remind you that
 
02:11:52.129 --> 02:11:52.139 align:start position:0%
no less an advocate of abortion rights
 
02:11:54.850 --> 02:11:54.860 align:start position:0%
than the late Ruth Ruth Bader Ginsburg
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
questioned the wisdom of placing the
 
02:11:59.689 --> 02:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
abortion question in the hands of the
 
02:11:59.699 --> 02:12:01.850 align:start position:0%
abortion question in the hands of the
Judiciary

02:12:01.850 --> 02:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
Judiciary
 
02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
like unelected judges we are the branch
 
02:12:07.370 --> 02:12:07.380 align:start position:0%
of government that is most accountable
 
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
to the people
 
02:12:12.290 --> 02:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
if we get it wrong the voters the voters
 
02:12:14.930 --> 02:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
will let us know about it soon enough at
 
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
the next election
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
by returning the public policy issue of
 
02:12:22.070 --> 02:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
reproductive of Reproductive Rights back
 
02:12:25.790 --> 02:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
to the courts this time the state courts
 
02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
we will inevitably be politicizing New
 
02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's courts
 
02:12:34.010 --> 02:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
with rare exceptions the selection of
 
02:12:35.629 --> 02:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
judges in New Hampshire has been
 
02:12:38.810 --> 02:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
remarkably free of political drama
 
02:12:40.750 --> 02:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
as I've had occasion to note before
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
Republican Governors have appointed
 
02:12:46.189 --> 02:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
Democrats to the bench and vice versa
 
02:12:48.410 --> 02:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
do we really want to create the
 
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
spectacle of Brett Kavanaugh type
 
02:12:53.089 --> 02:12:53.099 align:start position:0%
judicial confirmation hearings in New
 
02:12:53.099 --> 02:12:54.290 align:start position:0%
judicial confirmation hearings in New
Hampshire

02:12:54.290 --> 02:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:12:57.050 --> 02:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
I submit respectfully that the fetal
 
02:12:59.330 --> 02:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
Life protection act struck the right
 
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
balance between a woman's right to
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
choose and the state's legitimate
 
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
interest in protecting fetal life at
 
02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
some later point in the pregnancy I
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
believe it is a balance that is
 
02:13:13.370 --> 02:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
supported by the vast majority of New
 
02:13:14.689 --> 02:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens
 
02:13:17.629 --> 02:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
and since there is no serious threat of
 
02:13:20.030 --> 02:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
altering that balance there simply is no
 
02:13:22.669 --> 02:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
need for this constitutional amendment I
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
urge you to pass to press the red button
 
02:13:28.609 --> 02:13:28.619 align:start position:0%
so that another emotion may be made and
 
02:13:30.649 --> 02:13:30.659 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I asked for a division vote
 
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:45.290 --> 02:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I Rise to urge
 
02:13:48.050 --> 02:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
passage of cacr2
 
02:13:50.450 --> 02:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to place Constitutional
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment question on the 2024 warrant
 
02:13:55.970 --> 02:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
for all cities and towns in the state
 
02:13:58.129 --> 02:13:58.139 align:start position:0%
the Amendment states that an
 
02:13:59.569 --> 02:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
individual's right to personal
 
02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
reproductive autonomy shall not be
 
02:14:04.970 --> 02:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
denied or infringed unless justified by
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest achieved by
 
02:14:09.470 --> 02:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
the least restrictive means
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
it would be inserted after section 2B
 
02:14:14.209 --> 02:14:14.219 align:start position:0%
which added a broadly defined
 
02:14:16.609 --> 02:14:16.619 align:start position:0%
right to privacy to the constitution in
 
02:14:16.619 --> 02:14:18.169 align:start position:0%
right to privacy to the constitution in
2018.

02:14:18.169 --> 02:14:18.179 align:start position:0%
2018.
 
02:14:19.970 --> 02:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
before I address the elephant in the
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
room Regarding why we are likely talking
 
02:14:24.530 --> 02:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
about amending the state constitution in
 
02:14:26.810 --> 02:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
this way at this time
 
02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
and I want to be clear that's a little e
 
02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
non-partisan elephant that I just
 
02:14:33.709 --> 02:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
I want to First focus on what the bill
 
02:14:37.850 --> 02:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
actually says and does in that one
 
02:14:37.860 --> 02:14:41.030 align:start position:0%
actually says and does in that one
sentence

02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
there are essentially three components
 
02:14:45.770 --> 02:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
to the amendment it guarantees personal
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
reproductive autonomy meaning the
 
02:14:50.209 --> 02:14:50.219 align:start position:0%
ability to make one's own decisions in
 
02:14:53.689 --> 02:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
all aspects regarding one's reproduction
 
02:14:55.790 --> 02:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
science and medicine provide us with
 
02:14:57.950 --> 02:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
Incredible reproductive options
 
02:15:01.069 --> 02:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
augmenting those we are born with
 
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
some serve to prevent pregnancy and yes
 
02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
some to terminate pregnancy
 
02:15:08.270 --> 02:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
but many Also Serve to promote pregnancy
 
02:15:10.790 --> 02:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
and help create new life
 
02:15:13.370 --> 02:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
the first successful in vitro fertilized
 
02:15:16.430 --> 02:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
pregnancy was in 1978 and was quite
 
02:15:18.169 --> 02:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
controversial then
 
02:15:21.229 --> 02:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
today 1 in 50 babies born in the United
 
02:15:23.689 --> 02:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
States are born using this type of
 
02:15:26.270 --> 02:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
assistive reproductive therapy yet calls
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
to ban it remain
 
02:15:30.709 --> 02:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
conversely some governments have placed
 
02:15:33.649 --> 02:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
extreme limits on reproduction such as
 
02:15:35.330 --> 02:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
one child rules and even forced
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
sterilization thus a broad-based right
 
02:15:40.010 --> 02:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
is defined
 
02:15:42.589 --> 02:15:42.599 align:start position:0%
second it establishes this as an
 
02:15:44.810 --> 02:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
individual right meaning it grants
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
reproductive autonomy to all New
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents not just women not
 
02:15:51.830 --> 02:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
just during pregnancy
 
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
third and most importantly it provides
 
02:15:55.970 --> 02:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
for exceptions
 
02:15:57.950 --> 02:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
when justified by compelling State
 
02:16:00.290 --> 02:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
interest under a strict scrutiny
 
02:16:02.569 --> 02:16:02.579 align:start position:0%
standard this permits the government to
 
02:16:04.430 --> 02:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
still Place necessary restrictions on
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
current and future practices
 
02:16:09.169 --> 02:16:09.179 align:start position:0%
but only we're clearly Justified I'll
 
02:16:11.089 --> 02:16:11.099 align:start position:0%
say more on that in a moment
 
02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
okay now for that elephant
 
02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
the last last June the U.S Supreme
 
02:16:18.530 --> 02:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
Court's Dobbs V Jackson ruling
 
02:16:20.089 --> 02:16:20.099 align:start position:0%
overturned the federally guaranteed
 
02:16:21.890 --> 02:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
right to an abortion that had been
 
02:16:25.010 --> 02:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
protected for nearly 50 years under the
 
02:16:27.709 --> 02:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
established Rowan Casey decisions
 
02:16:29.930 --> 02:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
that didn't make abortion illegal but
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
rather delegated the issue back to the
 
02:16:33.290 --> 02:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
individual states
 
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
this is the first time in U.S history an
 
02:16:37.310 --> 02:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
established Federal right has been
 
02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
upended and given back to state
 
02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:40.310 align:start position:0%
upended and given back to state
legislatures

02:16:40.310 --> 02:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
legislatures
 
02:16:42.530 --> 02:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
so the vote we're about to take is
 
02:16:45.530 --> 02:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
unlike any other taken in the history of
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire house that's a big
 
02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:48.889 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire house that's a big
statement

02:16:48.889 --> 02:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
statement
 
02:16:50.750 --> 02:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
but it provides us with a unique
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity the opportunity for this
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
body to demonstrate that we live by the
 
02:16:58.129 --> 02:16:58.139 align:start position:0%
words that are so often invoked in this
 
02:16:58.139 --> 02:16:59.270 align:start position:0%
words that are so often invoked in this
chamber

02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
chamber
 
02:16:59.280 --> 02:17:00.530 align:start position:0%
chamber
Liberty

02:17:00.530 --> 02:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
Liberty
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
Freedom autonomy
 
02:17:03.359 --> 02:17:04.790 align:start position:0%
Freedom autonomy
privacy

02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
02:17:07.370 --> 02:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
individual rights limited government

intrusion personal responsibility and
 
02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:13.549 align:start position:0%
intrusion personal responsibility and
self-determination

02:17:13.549 --> 02:17:13.559 align:start position:0%
self-determination
 
02:17:15.349 --> 02:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
we've just been handed an incredible
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
power that used to belong to the people
 
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
of this state and the first thing we
 
02:17:22.370 --> 02:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
should do that we must do is offer to
 
02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
give it back
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
there's no greater embodiment of freedom
 
02:17:29.509 --> 02:17:29.519 align:start position:0%
and liberty privacy or autonomy than
 
02:17:31.849 --> 02:17:31.859 align:start position:0%
decisions we make over our lives our
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
families and our bodies
 
02:17:36.410 --> 02:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
abortion isn't the only reproductive
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
Freedom now in play
 
02:17:40.669 --> 02:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
in his concurrence on Dobbs Justice
 
02:17:43.849 --> 02:17:43.859 align:start position:0%
Thomas stated that the court has quote a
 
02:17:46.490 --> 02:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
duty to correct the error of other cases
 
02:17:48.530 --> 02:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
resting on the 14th Amendment under the
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
court same logic
 
02:17:53.870 --> 02:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
specifically he cited the 1965 five
 
02:17:55.849 --> 02:17:55.859 align:start position:0%
Griswold decision that guarantees the
 
02:17:58.250 --> 02:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
right to access contraception
 
02:18:00.650 --> 02:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
remember this is not a vote on whether
 
02:18:02.450 --> 02:18:02.460 align:start position:0%
to establish this right for the people
 
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
but simply to ask them if they want this
 
02:18:07.849 --> 02:18:07.859 align:start position:0%
right back or if we as legislators
 
02:18:10.669 --> 02:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
should continue to hold it
 
02:18:13.250 --> 02:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
here no means no
 
02:18:15.770 --> 02:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
voting no means we want to keep this new
 
02:18:17.389 --> 02:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
Authority without giving your
 
02:18:19.310 --> 02:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
constituents a say
 
02:18:22.730 --> 02:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
conversely however yes does not mean yes
 
02:18:24.589 --> 02:18:24.599 align:start position:0%
passing this bill does not directly
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
establish this rate
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
it simply puts the question before the
 
02:18:30.650 --> 02:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
voters and the bar for success is quite
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
High it will take three-fifths or sixty
 
02:18:35.810 --> 02:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
percent of us to Simply pass this bill
 
02:18:38.030 --> 02:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
and the other chamber must then do the
 
02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:38.990 align:start position:0%
and the other chamber must then do the
same

02:18:38.990 --> 02:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:18:42.410 --> 02:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
and even higher two-thirds or 67 percent
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
of Voters is then needed to ratify it on
 
02:18:47.810 --> 02:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
the ballot that's very close to the
 
02:18:49.610 --> 02:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
percentage that polls suggests might
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
support this concept so there's no
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
guarantee as to how such a vote would
 
02:18:55.370 --> 02:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
turn out
 
02:18:57.650 --> 02:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
knowing that How can any of us justify
 
02:19:00.770 --> 02:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
not putting the question before them
 
02:19:03.650 --> 02:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
if it passes it's not some radical new
 
02:19:06.049 --> 02:19:06.059 align:start position:0%
right being established but rather a
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
preservation of the status quo that's
 
02:19:10.969 --> 02:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
been in place for the majority of all of
 
02:19:14.089 --> 02:19:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:15.770 --> 02:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
I'll wrap up by addressing a few
 
02:19:18.110 --> 02:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
concerns that I'm sure exist
 
02:19:20.030 --> 02:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
won't this establish an unlimited right
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
to abortion at any point in pregnancy
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
will it automatically reverse the
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
24-week rules inserted into law last
 
02:19:29.330 --> 02:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
year this is where that compelling State
 
02:19:31.250 --> 02:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
interest and least restrictive means
 
02:19:34.009 --> 02:19:34.019 align:start position:0%
components come in
 
02:19:36.410 --> 02:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you what might be held as
 
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
the limits under this language I can say
 
02:19:40.969 --> 02:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
that both the Roe and KC decisions
 
02:19:42.889 --> 02:19:42.899 align:start position:0%
included limitations on the right to
 
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
abortion that are quite similar to
 
02:19:48.889 --> 02:19:48.899 align:start position:0%
current New Hampshire law in that regard
 
02:19:50.570 --> 02:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
might it end up before the New Hampshire
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to decide most likely yes
 
02:19:56.330 --> 02:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
but that's also what Dobbs handed down
 
02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:01.550 --> 02:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
similar safeguards are offered by the
 
02:20:03.550 --> 02:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
many constraints within which are
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
self-regulating medical profession
 
02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:07.610 align:start position:0%
self-regulating medical profession
operates

02:20:07.610 --> 02:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
operates
 
02:20:09.950 --> 02:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's those not new laws that have long
 
02:20:11.929 --> 02:20:11.939 align:start position:0%
prevented elective late-term abortions
 
02:20:13.490 --> 02:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
02:20:15.530 --> 02:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
we've heard about terrible practices
 
02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
carried out by Rogue medical providers
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
in other states most famously infamously
 
02:20:20.160 --> 02:20:21.710 align:start position:0%
in other states most famously infamously
Pennsylvania

02:20:21.710 --> 02:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
that Pennsylvania doctor is serving
 
02:20:26.750 --> 02:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
three consecutive life sentences for his
 
02:20:29.810 --> 02:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
actions not for violating some abortion
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
law but for murder
 
02:20:34.370 --> 02:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
and we were told in hearings that such
 
02:20:37.010 --> 02:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
practices could similarly be prosecuted
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law
 
02:20:39.720 --> 02:20:41.030 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law
finally

02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
finally
 
02:20:42.889 --> 02:20:42.899 align:start position:0%
while we shouldn't pass a constitutional
 
02:20:45.410 --> 02:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
amendment based on polls
 
02:20:47.330 --> 02:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
the polls do show that guaranteeing
 
02:20:49.849 --> 02:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
reproductive Choice has wider support
 
02:20:51.770 --> 02:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
than the margins by which most of us
 
02:20:54.050 --> 02:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
were elected
 
02:20:56.150 --> 02:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
who are we then to say that we won't

House Bill 88 adds no value

the existing statute allows all women

02:28:10.969 --> 02:28:10.979 align:start position:0%
rsas
 
02:28:13.730 --> 02:28:13.740 align:start position:0%
that are stated as exceptions
 
02:28:18.230 --> 02:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 88 a public policy would
 
02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
add no value
 
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
this bill has
 
02:28:22.260 --> 02:28:23.210 align:start position:0%
this bill has
potential

02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
potential
 
02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
of creating a fantasy situation
 
02:28:29.870 --> 02:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
that there is no evidence of
 
02:28:31.610 --> 02:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
the present law
 
02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
says that you can not have you can says
 
02:28:38.690 --> 02:28:38.700 align:start position:0%
you cannot you can have an abortion
 
02:28:42.349 --> 02:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
if there is no law preventing a crime
 
02:28:45.770 --> 02:28:45.780 align:start position:0%
then there is no crime example
 
02:28:45.780 --> 02:28:47.450 align:start position:0%
then there is no crime example
example

02:28:47.450 --> 02:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
example
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
there is no law stating I cannot hike
 
02:28:52.490 --> 02:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
Mount Washington
 
02:28:56.809 --> 02:28:56.819 align:start position:0%
therefore if a law or officer law
 
02:28:58.910 --> 02:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer
 
02:29:02.270 --> 02:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
arrested me for hiking Mount Washington
 
02:29:06.290 --> 02:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
it would have no merit and be thrown out
 
02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
there is no law that says you have to
 
02:29:14.630 --> 02:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
wear a yellow shirt on Fridays therefore
 
02:29:17.990 --> 02:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
you cannot be arrested for wearing a
 
02:29:20.450 --> 02:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
blue shirt on Friday
 
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
we do have a law
 
02:29:27.170 --> 02:29:27.180 align:start position:0%
that allows women to exercise their
 
02:29:31.070 --> 02:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
rights as stated in the existing rsas
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
and therefore they are protected of this
 
02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:36.050 align:start position:0%
and therefore they are protected of this
right

02:29:36.050 --> 02:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:29:39.170 --> 02:29:39.180 align:start position:0%
there is no evidence that the existing
 
02:29:42.349 --> 02:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
law would infringe on a woman's right to
 
02:29:45.950 --> 02:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
terminate a pregnancy I urge you to vote
 
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:49.680 align:start position:0%

hb88 does one thing it adds statutory
 
02:30:14.929 --> 02:30:14.939 align:start position:0%
protections for abortion before 24 weeks
 
02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
it does not change the 24-week abortion
 
02:30:17.880 --> 02:30:18.770 align:start position:0%
it does not change the 24-week abortion
ban

02:30:18.770 --> 02:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
ban
 
02:30:20.929 --> 02:30:20.939 align:start position:0%

as part of that law RSA 329 49 states
 
02:30:47.389 --> 02:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
nothing in this subdivision shall be
 
02:30:51.650 --> 02:30:51.660 align:start position:0%
construed as creating or recognizing a
 
02:30:53.630 --> 02:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
right to abortion
 
02:30:57.230 --> 02:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
in other words the 24-week abortion ban
 
02:31:00.050 --> 02:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
did not guarantee abortion protections
 
02:31:02.990 --> 02:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
prior to that cut off in fact the
 
02:31:06.770 --> 02:31:06.780 align:start position:0%
opposite is true there is only an RSA
 
02:31:09.650 --> 02:31:09.660 align:start position:0%
stating that there is no right to an
 
02:31:11.450 --> 02:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
abortion in New Hampshire
 
02:31:14.210 --> 02:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
last June the U.S Supreme Court
 
02:31:16.610 --> 02:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
overturned The Landmark decision in Roe
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
v Wade without Roe v Wade there is no
 
02:31:22.309 --> 02:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
longer a federal constitutionally
 
02:31:24.770 --> 02:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
protected right to abortion
 
02:31:28.130 --> 02:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
with our 24-week abortion ban there are
 
02:31:31.250 --> 02:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
also no State statutory protections for
 
02:31:33.670 --> 02:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
abortions prior to 24 weeks
 
02:31:38.090 --> 02:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
HBA hb88 adds critical protections prior
 
02:31:41.210 --> 02:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
to 24 weeks prohibiting the state from
 
02:31:43.250 --> 02:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
interfering with a woman's access to
 
02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
abortion in the first 23 weeks
 
02:31:48.469 --> 02:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
with Rogue on New Hampshire is one of
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
only three states where abortion is
 
02:31:53.690 --> 02:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
legal but not protected
 
02:31:57.290 --> 02:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
since the ruling in June 2022 18 states
 
02:32:00.349 --> 02:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
have passed abortion bans with 14 states
 
02:32:04.370 --> 02:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
banning abortion outright as of today 25
 
02:32:06.530 --> 02:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
million people have been impacted
 
02:32:06.540 --> 02:32:07.490 align:start position:0%
million people have been impacted
already

02:32:07.490 --> 02:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:32:10.550 --> 02:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
with one in three women of reproductive
 
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
age across the country losing access to
 
02:32:16.010 --> 02:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
abortion in her home state
 
02:32:19.010 --> 02:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
Granite State Granite Staters have seen
 
02:32:21.290 --> 02:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
these states banning abortion and they
 
02:32:24.349 --> 02:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
want us their elected representatives to
 
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
take action to protect abortion rights
 
02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:28.490 align:start position:0%
take action to protect abortion rights
here

02:32:28.490 --> 02:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:32:30.889 --> 02:32:30.899 align:start position:0%
specifically polling immediately after
 
02:32:33.230 --> 02:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
the election shows that a super majority
 
02:32:35.570 --> 02:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
of granite Staters value the right to an
 
02:32:37.730 --> 02:32:37.740 align:start position:0%
abortion and nearly two-thirds of
 
02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
granite Staters want their
 
02:32:41.570 --> 02:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
representatives to pass laws to support
 
02:32:43.849 --> 02:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
abortion rights
 
02:32:46.370 --> 02:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
I have heard my colleagues say there
 
02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
will be no more restrictions on abortion
 
02:32:50.990 --> 02:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
and Reproductive Rights in New Hampshire
 
02:32:54.050 --> 02:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
but how can the voters trust that this
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
body changes every two years I'm asking
 
02:32:58.910 --> 02:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
us today to Simply add in the
 
02:33:01.490 --> 02:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
protections to our state law prior to 24
 
02:33:06.050 --> 02:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
weeks HB 88 is a win-win today we can
 
02:33:08.510 --> 02:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
send a message to Granite Staters a
 
02:33:10.969 --> 02:33:10.979 align:start position:0%
clear purposeful message that the New
 
02:33:13.849 --> 02:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house supports and affirms an
 
02:33:16.190 --> 02:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
individual's right to an abortion and
 
02:33:18.170 --> 02:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
the tenets of Roe v Wade
 
02:33:20.030 --> 02:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
please join me in supporting the ought
 
02:33:23.270 --> 02:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
to pass motion on hb88

02:33:40.010 --> 02:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:33:42.290 --> 02:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
it is not sufficiently seconded

02:34:36.050 --> 02:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass on
 
02:34:38.929 --> 02:34:38.939 align:start position:0%
House Bill 88. this is a division vote
 
02:34:40.910 --> 02:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
 
02:34:45.410 --> 02:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:48.349 --> 02:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
02:34:50.210 --> 02:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
know last term New Hampshire house came
 
02:34:52.250 --> 02:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
together in a bipartisan Manner and
 
02:34:54.170 --> 02:34:54.180 align:start position:0%
passed a law that upheld our basic
 
02:34:56.389 --> 02:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
values regarding this issue on a
 
02:34:59.090 --> 02:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
unanimous bipartisan vote and if I know
 
02:35:01.010 --> 02:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
our current law satisfies and represents
 
02:35:02.510 --> 02:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
a majority of granite State's view on
 
02:35:02.520 --> 02:35:03.770 align:start position:0%
a majority of granite State's view on
abortion

02:35:03.770 --> 02:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
and lastly if I acknowledge the truth
 
02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
that Granite Staters identify as
 
02:35:09.830 --> 02:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
pro-choice but I also know that over
 
02:35:11.450 --> 02:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of granite stators support
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
some restrictions on abortion would I
 
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
now press the red button to oppose the
 
02:35:18.950 --> 02:35:18.960 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:35:29.570 --> 02:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
if I believe this legislature intends to
 
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
ensure women in New Hampshire have
 
02:35:33.770 --> 02:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
statutory protections to access abortion
 
02:35:35.809 --> 02:35:35.819 align:start position:0%
care in the first 23 weeks of a
 
02:35:37.429 --> 02:35:37.439 align:start position:0%

interference
 
02:35:41.030 --> 02:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill does not
 
02:35:43.250 --> 02:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
change anything in our law after those
 
02:35:45.530 --> 02:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
23 weeks of pregnancy
 
02:35:48.170 --> 02:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know that
 
02:35:50.929 --> 02:35:50.939 align:start position:0%
since the Supreme Court overturned Roe
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of only three
 
02:35:55.490 --> 02:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
states that has not codified protections
 
02:35:57.889 --> 02:35:57.899 align:start position:0%
for abortion under state law and the
 
02:36:00.530 --> 02:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
majority of our constituents are looking
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:38:03.950 --> 02:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
colleagues the basic question you must
 
02:38:06.650 --> 02:38:06.660 align:start position:0%
decide in voting on this bill is whether
 
02:38:09.650 --> 02:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
there should be a special exception for
 
02:38:11.690 --> 02:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
doctors and other health care providers
 
02:38:14.030 --> 02:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
that exempts them from the usual
 
02:38:16.550 --> 02:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
remedies and sanctions the law provides
 
02:38:18.830 --> 02:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
for unlawful conduct
 
02:38:21.650 --> 02:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
I submit the answer should be no which
 
02:38:23.809 --> 02:38:23.819 align:start position:0%
is why I urge you not to support this
 
02:38:23.819 --> 02:38:24.889 align:start position:0%
is why I urge you not to support this
bill

02:38:24.889 --> 02:38:24.899 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:38:27.290 --> 02:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
this would be this bill would repeal the
 
02:38:29.210 --> 02:38:29.220 align:start position:0%
civil and criminal remedies
 
02:38:31.250 --> 02:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
provisions of the fetal Life protection
 
02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:32.150 align:start position:0%
provisions of the fetal Life protection
act

02:38:32.150 --> 02:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
act
 
02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
the Civil remedies section allows
 
02:38:36.290 --> 02:38:36.300 align:start position:0%
certain persons including the mother and
 
02:38:38.690 --> 02:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
in some cases the father or maternal
 
02:38:41.570 --> 02:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
grandparents to obtain monetary damages
 
02:38:43.849 --> 02:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
against health care providers for
 
02:38:45.770 --> 02:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
psychological and physical injuries
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
caused by an abortion performed in
 
02:38:50.630 --> 02:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
violation of the ACT
 
02:38:53.030 --> 02:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
I intend to focus mainly on the criminal
 
02:38:55.910 --> 02:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
penalties provision of the ACT since
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
that is the section that has generated
 
02:39:00.469 --> 02:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
the most angst among some members of the
 
02:39:01.670 --> 02:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
medical community
 
02:39:03.770 --> 02:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
it is important to understand at the
 
02:39:06.830 --> 02:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
outset that performing an abortion with
 
02:39:09.410 --> 02:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
the consent of the mother does not
 
02:39:12.290 --> 02:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
constitute a homicide or assault type
 
02:39:14.929 --> 02:39:14.939 align:start position:0%
offense under the general criminal laws
 
02:39:16.190 --> 02:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
of this state
 
02:39:18.290 --> 02:39:18.300 align:start position:0%
thus without the criminal penalties
 
02:39:20.270 --> 02:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
provided in the fetal Life protection
 
02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
act performing an unlawful post-20 week
 
02:39:27.110 --> 02:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
24-week abortion would carry no criminal
 
02:39:27.120 --> 02:39:28.490 align:start position:0%
24-week abortion would carry no criminal
sanctions

02:39:28.490 --> 02:39:28.500 align:start position:0%
sanctions
 
02:39:30.650 --> 02:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
because an understanding of the exact
 
02:39:32.450 --> 02:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
terms of the criminal penalty provision
 
02:39:35.389 --> 02:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
of the fetal Life protection act is
 
02:39:37.849 --> 02:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
crucially important let me Begin by
 
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
quoting it
 
02:39:43.090 --> 02:39:43.100 align:start position:0%
any health care provider who knowingly
 
02:39:46.490 --> 02:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
performs or induces an abortion in
 
02:39:49.490 --> 02:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
violation of this subdivision
 
02:39:52.790 --> 02:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
and knows that the fetus has a
 
02:39:56.450 --> 02:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
gestational age of at least 24 weeks or
 
02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
consciously disregards a substantial
 
02:40:02.090 --> 02:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
risk that the fetus has a gestational
 
02:40:05.210 --> 02:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
age of at least 24 weeks shall be guilty
 
02:40:08.690 --> 02:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
of a class B felony the key words in the
 
02:40:11.389 --> 02:40:11.399 align:start position:0%
above section are knowingly and
 
02:40:13.630 --> 02:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
consciously disregards
 
02:40:17.210 --> 02:40:17.220 align:start position:0%
knowingly means actual knowledge
 
02:40:20.090 --> 02:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
not should have known or mere negligence
 
02:40:23.270 --> 02:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
or even recklessness but actual
 
02:40:25.670 --> 02:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge that the fetus was at least 24
 
02:40:28.730 --> 02:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
weeks old and knowledge as well that
 
02:40:30.650 --> 02:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
there were no circumstances that would
 
02:40:33.050 --> 02:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
make the abortion fall within the
 
02:40:35.809 --> 02:40:35.819 align:start position:0%
exceptions to the 24-week ban
 
02:40:38.389 --> 02:40:38.399 align:start position:0%
the consciously disregards language of
 
02:40:40.849 --> 02:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
the statute is designed to cover the
 
02:40:43.190 --> 02:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
circumstance of what the law often terms
 
02:40:45.230 --> 02:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
willful blindness
 
02:40:47.510 --> 02:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
that is the situation of a health care
 
02:40:50.150 --> 02:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
provider who claims not to have had
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
actual knowledge but where the evidence
 
02:40:55.550 --> 02:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
shows he or she lacks such not lacks
 
02:40:57.889 --> 02:40:57.899 align:start position:0%
such knowledge only because the pro
 
02:41:00.530 --> 02:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
provider made a conscious deliberate
 
02:41:03.550 --> 02:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
decision to close his eyes
 
02:41:06.950 --> 02:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
so as to avoid or disregard learning
 
02:41:09.230 --> 02:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
what was obvious that there was a
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
substantial risk the fetus was at least
 
02:41:14.030 --> 02:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
24 weeks of gestational age
 
02:41:16.730 --> 02:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
in short the criminal penalty comes into
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
play Only In the case of a doctor who
 
02:41:22.910 --> 02:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
makes a knowing conscious decision to
 
02:41:25.250 --> 02:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
violate the law and there is nothing
 
02:41:27.950 --> 02:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
unfair or unjust about imposing criminal
 
02:41:29.809 --> 02:41:29.819 align:start position:0%
sanctions against the health care
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
provider who flouts the law in this
 
02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:32.809 align:start position:0%
provider who flouts the law in this
fashion

02:41:32.809 --> 02:41:32.819 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
02:41:34.670 --> 02:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
just as we would do against any other
 
02:41:37.849 --> 02:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
person who knowingly violates the law
 
02:41:41.210 --> 02:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
the opponents of the penalty penalties
 
02:41:44.510 --> 02:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
Advanced two basic arguments first they
 
02:41:46.849 --> 02:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
claim that no health care provider in
 
02:41:49.070 --> 02:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire ever performs post 24-week
 
02:41:51.469 --> 02:41:51.479 align:start position:0%
abortions that would violate the statute
 
02:41:53.870 --> 02:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
they say that such abortions occur only
 
02:41:56.150 --> 02:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
in circumstances where there is a
 
02:41:58.610 --> 02:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
serious threat to the life or health of
 
02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
the mother or where there is a fatal
 
02:42:03.530 --> 02:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
fetal abnormality and these abortions
 
02:42:05.150 --> 02:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
are allowed under the fetal Life
 
02:42:06.410 --> 02:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
02:42:09.230 --> 02:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
the short answer to this argument is
 
02:42:11.450 --> 02:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
that if there if that is true then
 
02:42:12.950 --> 02:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals have nothing
 
02:42:14.510 --> 02:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
to worry about because there will simply
 
02:42:16.849 --> 02:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
be no criminal prosecutions
 
02:42:19.370 --> 02:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
the problem of course is that although
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
we would like to believe that no health
 
02:42:22.849 --> 02:42:22.859 align:start position:0%
care professional would deliberately
 
02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
violate the law
 
02:42:27.650 --> 02:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
we have we have seen uh both in the
 
02:42:30.170 --> 02:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
abortion context and in other contexts
 
02:42:32.389 --> 02:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
such as prescribing drugs we're not
 
02:42:34.490 --> 02:42:34.500 align:start position:0%
medically indicated that Health Care
 
02:42:38.270 --> 02:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
Providers do sometimes violate the law
 
02:42:40.490 --> 02:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
the second argument advanced in
 
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
opposition to the criminal penalties is
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
that complicated cases can arise
 
02:42:47.570 --> 02:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
in which Health Care provide
 
02:42:49.849 --> 02:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
professionals are required to make
 
02:42:52.370 --> 02:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
difficult judgment calls and they should
 
02:42:54.410 --> 02:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
not be inhibited from doing so by the
 
02:42:56.990 --> 02:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
prospect of later being held criminally
 
02:42:59.809 --> 02:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
or civilly liable there is no doubt that
 
02:43:03.110 --> 02:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
doctors often are required to deal with
 
02:43:05.090 --> 02:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
complicated cases and to make difficult
 
02:43:05.100 --> 02:43:06.410 align:start position:0%
complicated cases and to make difficult
decisions

02:43:06.410 --> 02:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:43:09.170 --> 02:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
but the requirement of engaging in
 
02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
knowingly unlawful conduct affords
 
02:43:13.730 --> 02:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers substantial
 
02:43:16.910 --> 02:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
protection against being prosecuted for
 
02:43:19.370 --> 02:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
mere errors in judgment even in
 
02:43:21.770 --> 02:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
circumstances where with the benefit of
 
02:43:24.050 --> 02:43:24.060 align:start position:0%
hindsight they perhaps should have acted
 
02:43:26.690 --> 02:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
differently in this regard please
 
02:43:28.790 --> 02:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
remember that the health care providers
 
02:43:30.889 --> 02:43:30.899 align:start position:0%
are not the only professionals who are
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
called upon to handle complicated
 
02:43:34.969 --> 02:43:34.979 align:start position:0%
situations and to make difficult
 
02:43:34.979 --> 02:43:36.290 align:start position:0%
situations and to make difficult
judgments

02:43:36.290 --> 02:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
judgments
 
02:43:39.410 --> 02:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
consider two examples the lawyer or
 
02:43:41.630 --> 02:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
accountant called upon to attest to the
 
02:43:44.750 --> 02:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
accuracy of a Securities filing and the
 
02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
police officer who must decide whether
 
02:43:48.469 --> 02:43:48.479 align:start position:0%
to use deadly force
 
02:43:50.870 --> 02:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
in both of these cases the facts and
 
02:43:53.870 --> 02:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances may be complicated and in
 
02:43:55.849 --> 02:43:55.859 align:start position:0%
the latter case the officer may have to
 
02:43:58.190 --> 02:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
make a split-second decision
 
02:44:00.530 --> 02:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
yet the prospect that there can be close
 
02:44:03.410 --> 02:44:03.420 align:start position:0%
calls and difficult cases does not mean
 
02:44:05.870 --> 02:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
that the lawyer the accountant or the
 
02:44:08.210 --> 02:44:08.220 align:start position:0%
police officer are exempt from pla from
 
02:44:10.849 --> 02:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
facing criminal and civil penalties if
 
02:44:13.250 --> 02:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
they intentionally commit fraud or
 
02:44:16.370 --> 02:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
knowingly use excessive force in these
 
02:44:18.410 --> 02:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
cases the mere Prospect of a loss of
 
02:44:20.630 --> 02:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
license or decertification as a police
 
02:44:23.389 --> 02:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
officer is not considered a sufficient
 
02:44:25.790 --> 02:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
sanction the law should be no different
 
02:44:28.130 --> 02:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
for Health Care Professionals the
 
02:44:30.110 --> 02:44:30.120 align:start position:0%
possibility of loss of a medical license
 
02:44:32.809 --> 02:44:32.819 align:start position:0%
is not a sufficient sanction for
 
02:44:35.929 --> 02:44:35.939 align:start position:0%
knowingly violating the law for these
 
02:44:38.750 --> 02:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
reasons I urge you to reject the the OTP
 
02:44:40.969 --> 02:44:40.979 align:start position:0%
motion on this bill by pressing the red
 
02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
button so that another motion can be
 
02:44:45.469 --> 02:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
made and Mr Speaker I respectfully asked
 
02:44:47.809 --> 02:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
for a division vote thank you
 
02:44:59.630 --> 02:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:01.790 --> 02:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and fellow
 
02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
colleagues for listening to me
 
02:45:08.389 --> 02:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
I rise in support of the OTP Mass motion
 
02:45:12.530 --> 02:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 224 a straightforward bill
 
02:45:14.809 --> 02:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
that would only remove the criminal
 
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
penalties on doctors and health care
 
02:45:20.030 --> 02:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
providers I want to assure my colleagues
 
02:45:22.849 --> 02:45:22.859 align:start position:0%
if and when we repeal this bill there
 
02:45:25.610 --> 02:45:25.620 align:start position:0%
are other avenues that already exist to
 
02:45:28.610 --> 02:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
ensure provider compliance with our laws
 
02:45:31.730 --> 02:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
including the oplc the Board of Medicine
 
02:45:34.610 --> 02:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
and criminal charges for assault and
 
02:45:41.690 --> 02:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:41.700 --> 02:45:43.490 align:start position:0%
 
to repeat

02:45:43.490 --> 02:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
to repeat
 
02:45:46.490 --> 02:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
if we believe in the fetal protection
 
02:45:49.070 --> 02:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
act there are no further changes that
 
02:45:52.550 --> 02:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
will occur the 24-week abortion stays in
 
02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:53.510 align:start position:0%
will occur the 24-week abortion stays in
place

02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:45:55.849 --> 02:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
but it so often happens
 
02:45:58.429 --> 02:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
there are unintended consequences with
 
02:46:01.070 --> 02:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
these penalties and we've heard directly
 
02:46:03.710 --> 02:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
from doctors and nurses across the state
 
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
including Dartmouth
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties discourage providers
 
02:46:11.090 --> 02:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
from relocating to New Hampshire to
 
02:46:11.100 --> 02:46:12.170 align:start position:0%
from relocating to New Hampshire to
practice

02:46:12.170 --> 02:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:46:15.290 --> 02:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
this reduces the availability of Highly
 
02:46:17.330 --> 02:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
specialized providers
 
02:46:20.450 --> 02:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago we received news that the
 
02:46:23.210 --> 02:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
11th Hospital in our state that was
 
02:46:24.889 --> 02:46:24.899 align:start position:0%
providing Labor and Delivery Services
 
02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
has closed there will be another one
 
02:46:29.210 --> 02:46:29.220 align:start position:0%
closing this year
 
02:46:32.929 --> 02:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
another birth center is has moved out of
 
02:46:32.939 --> 02:46:33.710 align:start position:0%
another birth center is has moved out of
state

02:46:33.710 --> 02:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:46:36.770 --> 02:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
we need to do everything we can to
 
02:46:39.610 --> 02:46:39.620 align:start position:0%
attract and retain Health Care Providers
 
02:46:43.070 --> 02:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
not deter them from coming here
 
02:46:46.610 --> 02:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
a further reduction in train maternal
 
02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
fetal medicine and neonatologist means
 
02:46:51.770 --> 02:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
there are fewer people to take care of
 
02:46:55.190 --> 02:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
all of us our wives our daughters our
 
02:46:57.230 --> 02:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
sisters and our children
 
02:47:00.110 --> 02:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
these criminal penalties also discourage
 
02:47:03.110 --> 02:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
medical students and residents from
 
02:47:05.690 --> 02:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
training in our state the chair of
 
02:47:07.849 --> 02:47:07.859 align:start position:0%
Obstetrics and Gynecology at Dartmouth
 
02:47:10.969 --> 02:47:10.979 align:start position:0%
Dr Alana Cass said this explicitly
 
02:47:12.530 --> 02:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
during the Committee hearing a little
 
02:47:12.540 --> 02:47:13.550 align:start position:0%
during the Committee hearing a little
more

02:47:13.550 --> 02:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:47:17.330 --> 02:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
then we could excuse me a month ago that
 
02:47:20.469 --> 02:47:20.479 align:start position:0%
residents stay at their medical school
 
02:47:24.410 --> 02:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
generally after graduation
 
02:47:26.929 --> 02:47:26.939 align:start position:0%
so if our laws discovered
 
02:47:29.170 --> 02:47:29.180 align:start position:0%
students from coming to New Hampshire
 
02:47:33.130 --> 02:47:33.140 align:start position:0%
then we are adding more difficulty to
 
02:47:35.270 --> 02:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
increasing them
 
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
patients should expect our providers to
 
02:47:40.490 --> 02:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
provide the best clinical care not
 
02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
Health Care restricted by complications
 
02:47:45.950 --> 02:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
of criminal or civil penalty
 
02:47:49.370 --> 02:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
again there are already systems in place
 
02:47:52.910 --> 02:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
to address compliance we do not need to
 
02:47:55.730 --> 02:47:55.740 align:start position:0%
have added penalties
 
02:47:58.250 --> 02:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
I know you've heard the facts about why
 
02:48:00.650 --> 02:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
we need more doctors and if we truly
 
02:48:03.170 --> 02:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
believe in the fetal protection act we
 
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
need to grow and not reduce the number
 
02:48:08.150 --> 02:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
of doctors that are providing Obstetrics
 
02:48:11.330 --> 02:48:11.340 align:start position:0%
and Gynecology services
 
02:48:13.730 --> 02:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
and if I can hold myself together I'd
 
02:48:16.670 --> 02:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
like to share a story that happened
 
02:48:19.309 --> 02:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
as we were as my daughter was being
 
02:48:21.889 --> 02:48:21.899 align:start position:0%
treated at Plymouth Hospital during her
 
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
pregnancy 10 months ago
 
02:48:26.750 --> 02:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
she was entering the last days of her
 
02:48:28.730 --> 02:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
pregnancy when she felt something was
 
02:48:31.550 --> 02:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:33.969 --> 02:48:33.979 align:start position:0%
within an hour she was at the hospital
 
02:48:36.650 --> 02:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
and her doctor had performed an
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
emergency cesarean section a hospital
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
that was still open in the North country
 
02:48:45.590 --> 02:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
the baby was born with its umbilical
 
02:48:49.490 --> 02:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
cord wrapped around its neck four times
 
02:48:52.910 --> 02:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
the baby survived because she didn't
 
02:48:55.429 --> 02:48:55.439 align:start position:0%
have to drive an hour to Dartmouth or an
 
02:48:57.469 --> 02:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
hour and a half to Boston
 
02:49:00.050 --> 02:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
we cannot allow the decline in good
 
02:49:03.889 --> 02:49:03.899 align:start position:0%
medical services to put our daughters
 
02:49:06.050 --> 02:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
at risk
 
02:49:09.110 --> 02:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
we should not have Draconian threats
 
02:49:11.450 --> 02:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
hanging over our doctors
 
02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
we should work to encourage more doctors
 
02:49:16.429 --> 02:49:16.439 align:start position:0%
to come to New Hampshire and do their
 
02:49:17.929 --> 02:49:17.939 align:start position:0%
life-saving work
 
02:49:20.389 --> 02:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
and please join with me
 
02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
in passing HB 224 so that more of our
 
02:49:27.349 --> 02:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
grandfathers and grandmothers can bounce
 
02:49:30.290 --> 02:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
a baby on their knees please press the
 
02:49:36.969 --> 02:49:36.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:39.230 --> 02:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
representative Granger has requested a
 
02:49:41.090 --> 02:49:41.100 align:start position:0%
roll call that is sufficiently seconded
 
02:50:25.630 --> 02:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:43.130 --> 02:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:45.710 --> 02:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
the motion before us has ought to pass
 
02:50:48.290 --> 02:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 224.
 
02:50:50.750 --> 02:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote chair
 
02:50:52.490 --> 02:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Lynn for a
 
02:50:58.670 --> 02:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:01.490 --> 02:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
02:51:03.230 --> 02:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
know that this bill would create a
 
02:51:05.570 --> 02:51:05.580 align:start position:0%
special rule for health care providers
 
02:51:07.610 --> 02:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
exempting them from liability for
 
02:51:09.710 --> 02:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
knowingly violating the laws of this
 
02:51:11.929 --> 02:51:11.939 align:start position:0%
state and if I know that no other
 
02:51:13.849 --> 02:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
professions or occupations that are
 
02:51:15.530 --> 02:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
required to handle complicated
 
02:51:18.230 --> 02:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
situations or make difficult decisions
 
02:51:20.690 --> 02:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
are afforded such special protections
 
02:51:22.730 --> 02:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the Criminal Intent
 
02:51:24.469 --> 02:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
provisions of the fetal Life protection
 
02:51:26.929 --> 02:51:26.939 align:start position:0%
act affords Health Care Professionals
 
02:51:29.570 --> 02:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
protection from being prosecuted for
 
02:51:32.210 --> 02:51:32.220 align:start position:0%
mere good faith errors of judgment and
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
even for negligent or Reckless conduct
 
02:51:37.610 --> 02:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
requiring instead proof of a knowing or
 
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
conscious intention to violate the law
 
02:51:42.770 --> 02:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that as with other
 
02:51:45.469 --> 02:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
professionals the mere Prospect of loss
 
02:51:47.450 --> 02:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
of license does not constitute an
 
02:51:49.370 --> 02:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
adequate sanction for intentional
 
02:51:51.830 --> 02:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
violation of the law then what I now
 
02:51:54.650 --> 02:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
press the red button to defeat the opp
 
02:51:56.809 --> 02:51:56.819 align:start position:0%
motion so that another emotion can be
 
02:51:59.510 --> 02:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
made thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:52:01.429 --> 02:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
do you recognize representative Nagel
 
02:52:09.410 --> 02:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:12.469 --> 02:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
02:52:16.370 --> 02:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
if I know that HB 224 is actually a
 
02:52:18.830 --> 02:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
pro-life Bill about patient care both
 
02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
mother and child and not about politics
 
02:52:29.150 --> 02:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:32.389 --> 02:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
and if I as a physician with very
 
02:52:34.490 --> 02:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
painful personal experience know that
 
02:52:36.290 --> 02:52:36.300 align:start position:0%
the threat of criminal penalties have
 
02:52:38.510 --> 02:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences of actually
 
02:52:41.330 --> 02:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
putting the women and the baby's life at
 
02:52:43.790 --> 02:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
risk by potentially delaying appropriate
 
02:52:43.800 --> 02:52:44.690 align:start position:0%
risk by potentially delaying appropriate
care

02:52:44.690 --> 02:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:52:47.410 --> 02:52:47.420 align:start position:0%
and if I know that highly qualified
 
02:52:49.790 --> 02:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
Obstetricians especially those who
 
02:52:52.370 --> 02:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
practice in high-risk pregnancies will
 
02:52:54.410 --> 02:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
not practice in New Hampshire because of
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
this existing statute aggravating an
 
02:52:59.990 --> 02:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
already problematic labor shortage
 
02:53:02.090 --> 02:53:02.100 align:start position:0%
and furthermore that I know that there's
 
02:53:04.309 --> 02:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
already more appropriate systems in
 
02:53:06.710 --> 02:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
place to ensure that doctors are legally
 
02:53:06.720 --> 02:53:08.210 align:start position:0%
place to ensure that doctors are legally
compliant

02:53:08.210 --> 02:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
compliant
 
02:53:10.070 --> 02:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
02:53:12.710 --> 02:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
I would like to know that not one of you
 
02:53:14.750 --> 02:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
would like to be responsible for your
 
02:53:16.910 --> 02:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
daughter or your granddaughter not being
 
02:53:19.250 --> 02:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
able to find an obstetrician to manage
 
02:53:21.309 --> 02:53:21.319 align:start position:0%
her high-risk pregnancy
 
02:53:24.110 --> 02:53:24.120 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily putting the life of your
 
02:53:26.929 --> 02:53:26.939 align:start position:0%
granddaughter or great granddaughter at
 
02:53:30.290 --> 02:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
risk then I would strongly suggest you

in a subjective assertion

and if I know that in a tight housing
 
02:56:42.550 --> 02:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
market such an imposition by law
 
02:56:45.110 --> 02:56:45.120 align:start position:0%

02:57:58.429 --> 02:57:58.439 align:start position:0%
know that house bill 261 protects the
 
02:58:01.130 --> 02:58:01.140 align:start position:0%
rights of the landlord by requiring rent
 
02:58:03.590 --> 02:58:03.600 align:start position:0%

03:06:00.410 --> 03:06:00.420 align:start position:0%
192-192
 
03:06:04.010 --> 03:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
I did vote to create the tide for what
 
03:06:05.990 --> 03:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
reason does the member rise
 
03:06:10.550 --> 03:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
I moved a table house bill 271.
 
03:06:14.809 --> 03:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
the motion is the table house bill 271.
 
03:06:17.090 --> 03:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question all those
 
03:06:19.790 --> 03:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
in favor say aye
 
03:06:21.349 --> 03:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
Paul's May
 
03:06:24.769 --> 03:06:24.779 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it and 271 is laid on the
 
03:06:24.779 --> 03:06:28.190 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it and 271 is laid on the
table

03:06:28.190 --> 03:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:30.710 --> 03:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
we have one more Bill there is no debate
 
03:06:33.590 --> 03:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
so please stay in your seats
 
03:06:35.809 --> 03:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
the committee on judiciary
 
03:06:38.090 --> 03:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
the committee on Judiciary to which was
 
03:06:41.330 --> 03:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
referred House Bill 562 FN an act
 
03:06:43.730 --> 03:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
requiring informed consent prior to
 
03:06:45.530 --> 03:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
receiving an abortion procedure having
 
03:06:47.870 --> 03:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
considered the same report the same with
 
03:06:49.610 --> 03:06:49.620 align:start position:0%
the following resolution resolve that is
 
03:06:51.710 --> 03:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate Senator Scott
 
03:06:53.809 --> 03:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
Wallace for the committee are you ready
 
03:06:55.730 --> 03:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
for the question all those in favor say
 
03:06:55.740 --> 03:06:57.050 align:start position:0%
for the question all those in favor say
aye

03:06:57.050 --> 03:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
aye
 
03:06:59.150 --> 03:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
that was opposed nay
 
03:07:01.730 --> 03:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it in the committee report
 
03:07:07.010 --> 03:07:07.020 align:start position:0%

committee on Judiciary to which was

referred Health Bill 591 FM and that
 
04:18:10.969 --> 04:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
prohibiting abortions after detection of
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%

the same with the

following resolution that is inexpedient

to legislate Senator Caitlin catab
 
04:18:24.189 --> 04:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
or for the committee chair recognizes

04:18:35.269 --> 04:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
04:18:36.910 --> 04:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
apparently reps
 
04:18:39.710 --> 04:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly simple bill
 
04:18:41.450 --> 04:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure a few of you don't agree
 
04:18:45.530 --> 04:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:47.030 --> 04:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
04:18:47.040 --> 04:18:48.889 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
ah

04:18:48.889 --> 04:18:48.899 align:start position:0%
ah
 
04:18:51.469 --> 04:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly simple bill
 
04:18:51.479 --> 04:18:53.030 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly simple bill
but

04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:18:54.769 --> 04:18:54.779 align:start position:0%
it has a few
 
04:18:58.849 --> 04:18:58.859 align:start position:0%
changes or a few points in it that I'm a
 
04:19:02.030 --> 04:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
few I'm sure a few of you may disagree
 
04:19:02.040 --> 04:19:03.349 align:start position:0%
few I'm sure a few of you may disagree
the

04:19:03.349 --> 04:19:03.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:19:03.359 --> 04:19:05.570 align:start position:0%
the
Constitution

04:19:05.570 --> 04:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
04:19:08.090 --> 04:19:08.100 align:start position:0%
right in the front part says
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
we enjoy the life enjoy and defending
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
life and Liberty
 
04:19:16.250 --> 04:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
uh this is and that's what this is all
 
04:19:16.260 --> 04:19:17.510 align:start position:0%
uh this is and that's what this is all
about

04:19:17.510 --> 04:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh fetal heart is a a point in
 
04:19:24.889 --> 04:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
conception or in gestation it's fairly
 
04:19:27.950 --> 04:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
easy to figure out it's not 24 weeks
 
04:19:31.130 --> 04:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
which are sort of arbitrary but it's you
 
04:19:34.790 --> 04:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
know it's X number of days into the
 
04:19:40.189 --> 04:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
brief and it's a time at which it would
 
04:19:42.769 --> 04:19:42.779 align:start position:0%
be easy for somebody to determine
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
and the feet of Life basically says if
 
04:19:49.969 --> 04:19:49.979 align:start position:0%
you can hear the heartbeat
 
04:19:52.849 --> 04:19:52.859 align:start position:0%
you don't abort
 
04:19:55.910 --> 04:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
fairly simple fairly straightforward
 
04:19:59.870 --> 04:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:01.550 --> 04:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
chair recognize chair recognize
 
04:20:06.290 --> 04:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:08.210 --> 04:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:20:13.910 --> 04:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
some of you know that I am a registered
 
04:20:17.090 --> 04:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
nurse and some of you might know that I
 
04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
have a degree in Biochemistry
 
04:20:22.490 --> 04:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
so I want to do a little bit of a
 
04:20:24.229 --> 04:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
science lesson
 
04:20:28.550 --> 04:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:36.290 --> 04:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
it's too loud in here remember has a
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
right to be heard thank you
 
04:20:44.150 --> 04:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
so the human heart uh it beats based on
 
04:20:49.429 --> 04:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
two particular ions sodium and potassium
 
04:20:51.370 --> 04:20:51.380 align:start position:0%
sodium carries a one plus charge
 
04:20:55.610 --> 04:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
potassium carries a two plus charge
 
04:20:59.510 --> 04:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
um sodium is the greatest extracellular
 
04:21:02.809 --> 04:21:02.819 align:start position:0%
ion so outside of the cell
 
04:21:06.729 --> 04:21:06.739 align:start position:0%
potassium is the greatest intra ion
 
04:21:10.670 --> 04:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
intracellular ion inside the cell okay
 
04:21:14.689 --> 04:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
on our cellular membranes is a sodium
 
04:21:17.510 --> 04:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
potassium pump
 
04:21:20.330 --> 04:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
as you probably remember
 
04:21:22.429 --> 04:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
things move from greatest concentration
 
04:21:24.830 --> 04:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
to lesser concentration
 
04:21:24.840 --> 04:21:26.330 align:start position:0%
to lesser concentration
naturally

04:21:26.330 --> 04:21:26.340 align:start position:0%
naturally
 
04:21:28.910 --> 04:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
so it uses the pump to pump like against
 
04:21:31.189 --> 04:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
the flow so to speak
 
04:21:34.729 --> 04:21:34.739 align:start position:0%
though the flow of those ions is what
 
04:21:38.030 --> 04:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:40.729 --> 04:21:40.739 align:start position:0%
and if you remember maybe from physics
 
04:21:40.739 --> 04:21:42.650 align:start position:0%
and if you remember maybe from physics
class

04:21:42.650 --> 04:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
class
 
04:21:45.889 --> 04:21:45.899 align:start position:0%
electricity moves from positive to
 
04:21:48.170 --> 04:21:48.180 align:start position:0%
negative and I already said that those
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
ions have a positive charge
 
04:21:54.650 --> 04:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
so in other words moving those ions
 
04:21:56.929 --> 04:21:56.939 align:start position:0%
causes a Beat
 
04:22:00.769 --> 04:22:00.779 align:start position:0%
okay this is uh this is a molecular
 
04:22:00.779 --> 04:22:02.450 align:start position:0%
okay this is uh this is a molecular
process

04:22:02.450 --> 04:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:22:05.570 --> 04:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
when you have a petri dish
 
04:22:08.510 --> 04:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
and you have cardiac cells that have
 
04:22:11.870 --> 04:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
developed and they are separate in the
 
04:22:13.550 --> 04:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
petri dish
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
then they beat separately
 
04:22:20.030 --> 04:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
if you move them together this this
 
04:22:21.769 --> 04:22:21.779 align:start position:0%
part's really cool if you move them
 
04:22:21.779 --> 04:22:22.750 align:start position:0%
part's really cool if you move them
together

04:22:22.750 --> 04:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:22:27.229 --> 04:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
then the ions affect each other and they
 
04:22:30.290 --> 04:22:30.300 align:start position:0%
all will be together and then you can
 
04:22:31.910 --> 04:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
separate them again and they will still
 
04:22:33.290 --> 04:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
beat separately it's pretty cool
 
04:22:33.300 --> 04:22:35.150 align:start position:0%
beat separately it's pretty cool
actually

04:22:35.150 --> 04:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:22:39.429 --> 04:22:39.439 align:start position:0%
so all of that to say that
 
04:22:45.050 --> 04:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
electricity is a molecular process it is
 
04:22:47.150 --> 04:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
based on ions
 
04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
it is not an indication of life
 
04:22:54.900 --> 04:22:54.910 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:54.910 --> 04:22:57.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:22:57.950 --> 04:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:23:01.309 --> 04:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:15.950 --> 04:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
this is the heartbeat bill
 
04:23:20.150 --> 04:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
I've said it before on committee I'm
 
04:23:22.309 --> 04:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
saying it again right now you can feel
 
04:23:24.170 --> 04:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
your own heart beating you know you're
 
04:23:24.180 --> 04:23:25.010 align:start position:0%
your own heart beating you know you're
alive

04:23:25.010 --> 04:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
alive
 
04:23:27.410 --> 04:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
all right without that heart beating we
 
04:23:29.990 --> 04:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
all know we need an EMT here or a
 
04:23:31.550 --> 04:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
doctorate to try to get it back going
 
04:23:31.560 --> 04:23:32.689 align:start position:0%
doctorate to try to get it back going
again

04:23:32.689 --> 04:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
is it electrical device sure isn't it I
 
04:23:39.050 --> 04:23:39.060 align:start position:0%
have to even I have to admit our bodies
 
04:23:42.050 --> 04:23:42.060 align:start position:0%
are wonderfully made it's it's ingenious
 
04:23:46.429 --> 04:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
you think about it and starting from
 
04:23:49.550 --> 04:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
the womb or actually even before the
 
04:23:51.290 --> 04:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
woman when the baby is actually in the
 
04:23:53.809 --> 04:23:53.819 align:start position:0%
womb and when that gets to my point here
 
04:23:55.849 --> 04:23:55.859 align:start position:0%
when does life start
 
04:23:57.769 --> 04:23:57.779 align:start position:0%
you just heard it's you know it's an
 
04:24:01.250 --> 04:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
electrical signal okay fine
 
04:24:02.750 --> 04:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
but someone created that electrical
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
signal we didn't create it and I don't
 
04:24:07.010 --> 04:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
think we know how to create the egg or
 
04:24:08.929 --> 04:24:08.939 align:start position:0%
the or the seed yet either
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
until we do someone else has created
 
04:24:10.920 --> 04:24:12.229 align:start position:0%
until we do someone else has created
that

04:24:12.229 --> 04:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:24:15.349 --> 04:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
now at this point life we can all do we
 
04:24:17.090 --> 04:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
can all come up to a point and say when
 
04:24:19.849 --> 04:24:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:22.670 --> 04:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
does it begin at the birth the actual
 
04:24:22.680 --> 04:24:23.510 align:start position:0%
does it begin at the birth the actual
birth

04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
birth
 
04:24:25.729 --> 04:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
at six months
 
04:24:28.130 --> 04:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
you know at any place between the
 
04:24:32.689 --> 04:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
heartbeat in six months is it conception
 
04:24:36.410 --> 04:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
how about is it even before conception
 
04:24:42.170 --> 04:24:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:45.469 --> 04:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
piece of literature
 
04:24:47.809 --> 04:24:47.819 align:start position:0%
that will actually show you a state
 
04:24:50.990 --> 04:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's 3 500 years old
 
04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
and states that you every one of us here
 
04:24:57.290 --> 04:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
were known before we were even
 
04:24:59.389 --> 04:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
thought of being
 
04:25:02.450 --> 04:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
coming to the conception
 
04:25:04.370 --> 04:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
every one of us and think of this right
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
now every one of us are here for this
 
04:25:06.720 --> 04:25:08.090 align:start position:0%
now every one of us are here for this
moment

04:25:08.090 --> 04:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
moment
 
04:25:10.670 --> 04:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
this may and you have you guys and I
 
04:25:13.550 --> 04:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
have to say ladies guys sorry excuse me
 
04:25:16.250 --> 04:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
I have to say
 
04:25:18.590 --> 04:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
many of you have many more years than I
 
04:25:21.610 --> 04:25:21.620 align:start position:0%
do in this Great Hall
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
but we're here to try to do what's right
 
04:25:31.189 --> 04:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:32.090 --> 04:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:35.210 --> 04:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
at this point because we don't count how
 
04:25:37.670 --> 04:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
many abortions we do
 
04:25:39.889 --> 04:25:39.899 align:start position:0%
shame on us we try to get a billion pass
 
04:25:41.870 --> 04:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
today we couldn't even do that
 
04:25:43.429 --> 04:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
but because we don't count we have to
 
04:25:45.710 --> 04:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
kind of kind of go by estimates
 
04:25:47.929 --> 04:25:47.939 align:start position:0%
so think of the estimates out there
 
04:25:50.450 --> 04:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
two thousand a year abortions that are
 
04:25:50.460 --> 04:25:51.590 align:start position:0%
two thousand a year abortions that are
done

04:25:51.590 --> 04:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:25:54.590 --> 04:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
20 years that's 40 000.
 
04:25:57.950 --> 04:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
human beings that are no longer here
 
04:26:01.070 --> 04:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
but if they were hey our schools would
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
actually be full instead of declining
 
04:26:05.809 --> 04:26:05.819 align:start position:0%
those people that we actually need to
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
work and jobs would actually have them
 
04:26:11.210 --> 04:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
but instead they're not here
 
04:26:13.370 --> 04:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
so let me bring up another fact
 
04:26:16.610 --> 04:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
another fact or at least I believe it is
 
04:26:18.950 --> 04:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
deception you know let's look at
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:24.830 --> 04:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
I had to go and look it up because you
 
04:26:27.050 --> 04:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
know I'm not an English major
 
04:26:29.870 --> 04:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
but and I like to know things that I say
 
04:26:31.790 --> 04:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
are truthful
 
04:26:34.429 --> 04:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
and it says so what is deception it's an
 
04:26:37.729 --> 04:26:37.739 align:start position:0%
act or statement that misleads hides the
 
04:26:39.950 --> 04:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
truth or promotes belief
 
04:26:41.990 --> 04:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh concept
 
04:26:45.290 --> 04:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
idea that is not true
 
04:26:47.510 --> 04:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
or an idea that is not true
 
04:26:50.030 --> 04:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
it is often done for personal gain or
 
04:26:50.040 --> 04:26:51.469 align:start position:0%
it is often done for personal gain or
advantage

04:26:51.469 --> 04:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
04:26:53.870 --> 04:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
deception can be involved and
 
04:26:53.880 --> 04:26:56.510 align:start position:0%
deception can be involved and
propaganda

04:26:56.510 --> 04:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
propaganda
 
04:26:59.450 --> 04:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
slight sleight of hand
 
04:27:02.330 --> 04:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
distraction camouflage and concealment
 
04:27:04.849 --> 04:27:04.859 align:start position:0%
you get the point deception
 
04:27:06.769 --> 04:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
04:27:09.889 --> 04:27:09.899 align:start position:0%
and I believe with all not just women I
 
04:27:13.130 --> 04:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
think the men as well our entire
 
04:27:14.929 --> 04:27:14.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the people of New
 
04:27:15.950 --> 04:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the people of the United
 
04:27:18.290 --> 04:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
States the people around the globe have
 
04:27:21.710 --> 04:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
been deceived deceived that abortion is
 
04:27:21.720 --> 04:27:22.849 align:start position:0%
been deceived deceived that abortion is
not

04:27:22.849 --> 04:27:22.859 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:27:26.929 --> 04:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
killing or aborting a baby
 
04:27:28.429 --> 04:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
all right because we're saying hey
 
04:27:30.830 --> 04:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
abortion starts this time abortion
 
04:27:33.170 --> 04:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
starts that time it doesn't I believe
 
04:27:35.750 --> 04:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
that we've been deceived to think that
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
abortion starts at this time of that
 
04:27:37.199 --> 04:27:37.969 align:start position:0%
abortion starts at this time of that
time

04:27:37.969 --> 04:27:37.979 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:27:39.769 --> 04:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
but at this at this point here I'm going
 
04:27:41.330 --> 04:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
to leave this because I can keep going
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
on and on and I don't want to keep
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
taking the whole day up because we got
 
04:27:47.389 --> 04:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:49.250 --> 04:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
but I also believe you are here at this
 
04:27:53.689 --> 04:27:53.699 align:start position:0%
time this day this moment for this vote
 
04:27:55.250 --> 04:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
in history
 
04:27:57.170 --> 04:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
that's being recorded
 
04:27:58.729 --> 04:27:58.739 align:start position:0%
even if we don't record it on a roll
 
04:28:00.710 --> 04:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
call it's being recorded
 
04:28:02.929 --> 04:28:02.939 align:start position:0%
to stand up for life
 
04:28:07.490 --> 04:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:11.929 --> 04:28:11.939 align:start position:0%
For You O God created my inner being you
 
04:28:15.110 --> 04:28:15.120 align:start position:0%

all the days ordained for me were
 
04:28:31.969 --> 04:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
written in your book
 
04:28:35.630 --> 04:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
before one of them came to be before one
 
04:28:37.729 --> 04:28:37.739 align:start position:0%
of them ever came to be
 
04:28:39.469 --> 04:28:39.479 align:start position:0%

thank you I hope we're having a division
 
04:29:12.969 --> 04:29:12.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:15.170 --> 04:29:15.180 align:start position:0%
representative Granger has requested a

that this vote by pressing I believe
 
04:30:32.149 --> 04:30:32.159 align:start position:0%

if I know last term New Hampshire house
 
04:31:12.710 --> 04:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
came together in a bipartisan Manner and
 
04:31:14.570 --> 04:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
passed a law that upheld our basic

Staters identify as pro-choice but also
 
04:31:30.410 --> 04:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
know that over two-thirds of granite
 
04:31:32.450 --> 04:31:32.460 align:start position:0%

04:33:20.510 --> 04:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 150 has to do with the amount
 
04:33:23.631 --> 04:33:23.641 align:start position:0%
of individuals needed to create a
 
04:33:25.849 --> 04:33:25.859 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit
 
04:33:31.070 --> 04:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
it has been 10 individuals since 1975.
 
04:33:33.289 --> 04:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
you'll see on the
 
04:33:37.810 --> 04:33:37.820 align:start position:0%
report on page 39 the chronology of of
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
this law
 
04:33:43.369 --> 04:33:43.379 align:start position:0%
we had one group come to us
 
04:33:44.869 --> 04:33:44.879 align:start position:0%
complaining that they had six
 
04:33:44.879 --> 04:33:46.670 align:start position:0%
complaining that they had six
individuals

04:33:46.670 --> 04:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
04:33:48.890 --> 04:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
and those individuals could not create
 
04:33:50.689 --> 04:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
their own bargaining unit
 
04:33:53.150 --> 04:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
so they wanted to reduce the amount of
 
04:33:56.390 --> 04:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
individuals needed from ten to five
 
04:33:58.670 --> 04:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
those individuals were able to join a
 
04:34:00.590 --> 04:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
union they joined a different Union
 
04:34:02.570 --> 04:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
within that municipality
 
04:34:04.810 --> 04:34:04.820 align:start position:0%
so they were not
 
04:34:09.109 --> 04:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
voided of the ability to join a union
 
04:34:11.090 --> 04:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
the group then went to complain that
 
04:34:14.209 --> 04:34:14.219 align:start position:0%
well yeah but it wasn't our Union and
 
04:34:16.131 --> 04:34:16.141 align:start position:0%
they didn't provide good enough wages or
 
04:34:16.141 --> 04:34:17.330 align:start position:0%
they didn't provide good enough wages or
safety

04:34:17.330 --> 04:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
safety
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
so for that reason that Union wasn't
 
04:34:20.570 --> 04:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
good enough and they should join our
 
04:34:20.580 --> 04:34:26.209 align:start position:0%
good enough and they should join our
Union

04:34:26.209 --> 04:34:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:28.369 --> 04:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
as I said it's been 10 for a number of
 
04:34:30.949 --> 04:34:30.959 align:start position:0%
years and why has it been that way well
 
04:34:33.349 --> 04:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
in my city in Manchester they have
 
04:34:35.029 --> 04:34:35.039 align:start position:0%
full-time people that deal with the
 
04:34:36.830 --> 04:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
unions the union bargaining and Union
 
04:34:38.631 --> 04:34:38.641 align:start position:0%
negotiating and that's fine but some
 
04:34:40.189 --> 04:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
other smaller towns don't have that
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
luxury they don't have the financing to
 
04:34:45.470 --> 04:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
do that they can't afford to have a
 
04:34:47.330 --> 04:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
large number of very small unions so
 
04:34:49.970 --> 04:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
they group them together and it makes it
 
04:34:52.369 --> 04:34:52.379 align:start position:0%
easier for those towns to negotiate and
 
04:34:53.990 --> 04:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
there is a cost associated with it
 
04:34:57.349 --> 04:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
without question this is a a compromise
 
04:34:59.810 --> 04:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
that was made
 
04:34:59.820 --> 04:35:00.349 align:start position:0%
that was made
um

04:35:00.349 --> 04:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:02.449 --> 04:35:02.459 align:start position:0%
to try to satisfy the certain number of
 
04:35:05.750 --> 04:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
people to create a bargaining group with
 
04:35:08.631 --> 04:35:08.641 align:start position:0%
the cost of associated of the cost
 
04:35:11.869 --> 04:35:11.879 align:start position:0%
associated with doing that
 
04:35:13.970 --> 04:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
as I said this has been a law since
 
04:35:13.980 --> 04:35:15.769 align:start position:0%
as I said this has been a law since
1975.

04:35:15.769 --> 04:35:15.779 align:start position:0%
1975.
 
04:35:17.449 --> 04:35:17.459 align:start position:0%
and I believe it should stay where it is
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
and no one was disenfranchised here no
 
04:35:22.070 --> 04:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
one was not allowed to join a union
 
04:35:26.750 --> 04:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:29.689 --> 04:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
to vote against the the uh ought to pass
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
go for a further motion
 
04:35:40.189 --> 04:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:43.490 --> 04:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:46.070 --> 04:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker hb150 is a very
 
04:35:47.869 --> 04:35:47.879 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill
 
04:35:51.769 --> 04:35:51.779 align:start position:0%
at present RSA 273a requires that in
 
04:35:53.750 --> 04:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
order to have a certification vote for a
 
04:35:55.730 --> 04:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
new bargaining unit
 
04:35:58.670 --> 04:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
in in the public sector that is that
 
04:36:00.230 --> 04:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
potential unit must have at least 10
 
04:36:01.609 --> 04:36:01.619 align:start position:0%
employees who would be part of that
 
04:36:03.250 --> 04:36:03.260 align:start position:0%
bargain unit
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
hb150 reduces that number to a five
 
04:36:08.390 --> 04:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
employee minimum
 
04:36:11.150 --> 04:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
passing hb150 will open the door to
 
04:36:13.369 --> 04:36:13.379 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining for employees who
 
04:36:15.709 --> 04:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
For No Good Reason have been denied this
 
04:36:17.810 --> 04:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
privilege up until now
 
04:36:20.929 --> 04:36:20.939 align:start position:0%
the 10-member minimum in current law is
 
04:36:23.150 --> 04:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
truly an arbitrary number
 
04:36:25.789 --> 04:36:25.799 align:start position:0%
there is no identifiable reason why
 
04:36:27.830 --> 04:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
smaller units should be denied the right
 
04:36:31.250 --> 04:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
to engage in collective bargaining
 
04:36:34.250 --> 04:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
back when I was doing this work I recall
 
04:36:36.529 --> 04:36:36.539 align:start position:0%
getting phone calls from
 
04:36:39.109 --> 04:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
groups that want to negotiate
 
04:36:42.529 --> 04:36:42.539 align:start position:0%
and my statement to them was and at that
 
04:36:44.449 --> 04:36:44.459 align:start position:0%
point most of the large units were
 
04:36:44.459 --> 04:36:45.189 align:start position:0%
point most of the large units were
already

04:36:45.189 --> 04:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:36:49.189 --> 04:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
organized so smaller units were calling
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
and I would often have to say to them
 
04:36:54.109 --> 04:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
before we can move forward you have to
 
04:36:56.750 --> 04:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
be able to count to ten
 
04:36:59.330 --> 04:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
on many occasions they said but there's
 
04:37:00.949 --> 04:37:00.959 align:start position:0%
only eight of us
 
04:37:02.990 --> 04:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
there's only six of us there's only nine
 
04:37:06.410 --> 04:37:06.420 align:start position:0%
of us anything less than 10 can't be
 
04:37:06.420 --> 04:37:08.990 align:start position:0%
of us anything less than 10 can't be
certified

04:37:08.990 --> 04:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:11.090 --> 04:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
and I often had to just turn them away
 
04:37:14.269 --> 04:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
saying this project is dead in the water
 
04:37:17.869 --> 04:37:17.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:19.910 --> 04:37:19.920 align:start position:0%

04:37:46.980 --> 04:38:21.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:38:21.170 --> 04:38:21.180 align:start position:0%

this is a division vote chair recognized
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth for a
 
04:38:34.189 --> 04:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
04:38:39.529 --> 04:38:39.539 align:start position:0%
know that this bill would cut in half
 
04:38:41.810 --> 04:38:41.820 align:start position:0%
the threshold required to form a
 
04:38:44.449 --> 04:38:44.459 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining unit
 
04:38:46.330 --> 04:38:46.340 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this would
 
04:38:49.070 --> 04:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impact the smallest
 
04:38:51.529 --> 04:38:51.539 align:start position:0%
communities here in New Hampshire would
 
04:38:55.269 --> 04:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
I not then press the red button
 
04:38:58.250 --> 04:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
to maintain the status quo in our
 
04:39:00.529 --> 04:39:00.539 align:start position:0%
current law thank you
 
04:39:02.390 --> 04:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative Susie for
 
04:39:07.131 --> 04:39:07.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:09.590 --> 04:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
04:39:11.150 --> 04:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
believe that all public sector employees
 
04:39:12.349 --> 04:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
should have the right to belong to a
 
04:39:14.810 --> 04:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
bargain unit of their choice and if I
 
04:39:16.369 --> 04:39:16.379 align:start position:0%
know that the current law requires the
 
04:39:17.631 --> 04:39:17.641 align:start position:0%
minimum of 10 employees for a
 
04:39:19.490 --> 04:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
certification vote to occur which makes
 
04:39:21.709 --> 04:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
it difficult for employees of smaller
 
04:39:24.109 --> 04:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities to organize and finally
 
04:39:26.330 --> 04:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that house bill 150
 
04:39:27.830 --> 04:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
would lower the number of employees from
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
10 to 5 allowing these smaller groups of
 
04:39:31.789 --> 04:39:31.799 align:start position:0%
employees to the ability to organize

I rise in opposition of the itl on cacr4
 
04:46:49.490 --> 04:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
during committee I like that this bill
 
04:46:52.430 --> 04:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
was bipartisan in the presentation by my
 
04:46:54.110 --> 04:46:54.120 align:start position:0%
colleague from Claremont
 
04:46:56.990 --> 04:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
was logical and well done we do not
 
04:46:59.390 --> 04:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
believe that our Founders intended to
 
04:47:01.190 --> 04:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
keep the stipend of two hundred dollars
 
04:47:06.530 --> 04:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
set in 1889 stagnant for 134 plus years
 
04:47:09.230 --> 04:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is an update to a number that
 
04:47:11.990 --> 04:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
was reasonable in 1889 but is no longer
 
04:47:16.010 --> 04:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
reasonable in 2023 due to inflation
 
04:47:18.288 --> 04:47:18.298 align:start position:0%
I think we can all agree that being a
 
04:47:20.810 --> 04:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
state representative is indeed a job be
 
04:47:23.150 --> 04:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
it part-time for some or full-time for
 
04:47:25.850 --> 04:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
others depending on your committee the
 
04:47:27.470 --> 04:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
role requires a significant time
 
04:47:29.570 --> 04:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
commitment that takes us away from our
 
04:47:32.208 --> 04:47:32.218 align:start position:0%
regular jobs time with family and other
 
04:47:32.218 --> 04:47:33.708 align:start position:0%
regular jobs time with family and other
responsibilities

04:47:33.708 --> 04:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
04:47:36.110 --> 04:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
this bill adjusts the two hundred dollar
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
stipend set in 1889 for a two-year term
 
04:47:41.990 --> 04:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
to a more realistic value of five
 
04:47:44.750 --> 04:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for a two-year term
 
04:47:47.150 --> 04:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
to help defray costs that we all
 
04:47:50.448 --> 04:47:50.458 align:start position:0%
encounter be that meals missed work days
 
04:47:53.690 --> 04:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
Child Care coverage or hotels booked
 
04:47:55.850 --> 04:47:55.860 align:start position:0%
during bad weather or long evenings such
 
04:48:00.230 --> 04:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:02.690 --> 04:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
just as elected officials in our towns
 
04:48:05.330 --> 04:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
and cities receive reasonable stipends
 
04:48:07.730 --> 04:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
for their roles on the select board City
 
04:48:10.250 --> 04:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
councils School boards Etc
 
04:48:12.590 --> 04:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
it is appropriate to adjust the stipend
 
04:48:14.930 --> 04:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
to a modern day value to reflect the
 
04:48:16.910 --> 04:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
time commitment and expenses incurred
 
04:48:19.788 --> 04:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
while doing the job of a legislator
 
04:48:22.190 --> 04:48:22.200 align:start position:0%

04:48:40.430 --> 04:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
this is pretty simple
 
04:48:42.590 --> 04:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
since pretty much World War one we have
 
04:48:45.470 --> 04:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
become a volunteer legislature so here's
 
04:48:47.690 --> 04:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
your choice do we stay being a volunteer
 
04:48:47.700 --> 04:48:49.128 align:start position:0%
your choice do we stay being a volunteer
legislature

04:48:49.128 --> 04:48:49.138 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:48:51.770 --> 04:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
or do we become kind of a half-paid
 
04:48:54.590 --> 04:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
legislature with a per diem
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's simply what the choice is
 
04:48:59.150 --> 04:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
we're over a hundred years now of being
 
04:49:02.690 --> 04:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
a part-time volunteer legislature
 
04:49:05.330 --> 04:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
we all volunteered to be here today
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
because we all decided to run for office
 
04:49:09.770 --> 04:49:09.780 align:start position:0%
and that's a simple choice
 
04:49:11.330 --> 04:49:11.340 align:start position:0%
the committee felt that we should
 
04:49:14.750 --> 04:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
continue to be a volunteer legislature
 
04:49:17.330 --> 04:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to support the itl motion
 
04:49:19.128 --> 04:49:19.138 align:start position:0%
and keep the tradition of this body
 
04:49:22.128 --> 04:49:22.138 align:start position:0%

04:50:52.850 --> 04:50:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:55.310 --> 04:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:50:58.610 --> 04:50:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:01.128 --> 04:51:01.138 align:start position:0%
if I know that we've got many great
 
04:51:04.128 --> 04:51:04.138 align:start position:0%
traditions in this house
 
04:51:05.990 --> 04:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
but that one hundred dollars a year
 
04:51:09.410 --> 04:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
salary is not one of them
 
04:51:12.830 --> 04:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the 100 rate was set
 
04:51:15.788 --> 04:51:15.798 align:start position:0%
way back in 1889
 
04:51:18.288 --> 04:51:18.298 align:start position:0%
134 years ago
 
04:51:19.910 --> 04:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
when the dollar was really worth
 
04:51:19.920 --> 04:51:22.190 align:start position:0%
when the dollar was really worth
something

04:51:22.190 --> 04:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:51:25.730 --> 04:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
and it is woefully meager stipend right
 
04:51:28.850 --> 04:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
now at today's value not covering the
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
many expenses
 
04:51:33.530 --> 04:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
that are unreimbursed
 
04:51:35.810 --> 04:51:35.820 align:start position:0%
either by the hundred dollars or by a
 
04:51:38.510 --> 04:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
per diem or by mileage
 
04:51:41.470 --> 04:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking of
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
unreimbursed campaigns expenses
 
04:51:47.810 --> 04:51:47.820 align:start position:0%
time off from work to come here to do
 
04:51:50.090 --> 04:51:50.100 align:start position:0%
the people's business
 
04:51:52.250 --> 04:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
and I know on both sides of the aisle
 
04:51:55.368 --> 04:51:55.378 align:start position:0%
there are two ladies with Children Here
 
04:51:58.550 --> 04:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
and would they be suited to have some
 
04:52:02.570 --> 04:52:02.580 align:start position:0%
Child Care expense for child care
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
I could go on and on all day long with
 
04:52:07.670 --> 04:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
this and you know it but I'm not going
 
04:52:07.680 --> 04:52:09.170 align:start position:0%
this and you know it but I'm not going
to

04:52:09.170 --> 04:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:52:11.330 --> 04:52:11.340 align:start position:0%
and if I know
 
04:52:13.670 --> 04:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
that this is not a race we're giving
 
04:52:16.610 --> 04:52:16.620 align:start position:0%
ourselves but rather an effort just to
 
04:52:16.620 --> 04:52:17.570 align:start position:0%
ourselves but rather an effort just to
keep

04:52:17.570 --> 04:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
keep
 
04:52:20.170 --> 04:52:20.180 align:start position:0%
just to recoup the many
 
04:52:23.448 --> 04:52:23.458 align:start position:0%
uncompensated expenses we incur
 
04:52:26.810 --> 04:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
in time and effort to do this work while
 
04:52:28.250 --> 04:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
missing work
 
04:52:31.010 --> 04:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
and if I know that we're not determined
 
04:52:32.690 --> 04:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
representative this is a parliamentary
 
04:52:34.368 --> 04:52:34.378 align:start position:0%
inquiry not a speech
 
04:52:37.550 --> 04:52:37.560 align:start position:0%

the charge the any change in part one
 
04:52:43.430 --> 04:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
Article 15 of the Constitution but
 
04:52:46.490 --> 04:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
rather bringing it up to date
 
04:52:49.010 --> 04:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
and letting the voters do that we're not
 
04:52:51.050 --> 04:52:51.060 align:start position:0%
voting ourselves a raise we're letting
 
04:52:52.670 --> 04:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
the voters make a decision but
 
04:52:55.850 --> 04:52:55.860 align:start position:0%

housing crisis
 
04:56:33.770 --> 04:56:33.780 align:start position:0%

regulations in communities
 
04:56:46.670 --> 04:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
have made it difficult for developers to

keep up with the demand for housing in

applied economic research estimated that
 
04:57:43.128 --> 04:57:43.138 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's housing market needs at
 
04:57:47.690 --> 04:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
least 20 000 new housing units to
 
04:57:52.150 --> 04:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
satisfy the current market demand
 
04:57:56.690 --> 04:57:56.700 align:start position:0%
HB 223 would increase the number of
 
04:57:58.810 --> 04:57:58.820 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units
 
04:58:02.750 --> 04:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
Allowed by right from one to two
 
04:58:07.010 --> 04:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
change the attached unit definition and
 
04:58:10.448 --> 04:58:10.458 align:start position:0%
increase the maximum square footage from
 
04:58:14.150 --> 04:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
750 to 1000 square feet
 
04:58:17.208 --> 04:58:17.218 align:start position:0%
this bill would also give towns the
 
04:58:20.330 --> 04:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
right to require that one of those
 
04:58:22.208 --> 04:58:22.218 align:start position:0%
dwelling units
 
04:58:25.970 --> 04:58:25.980 align:start position:0%

04:58:33.170 --> 04:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis continues and this
 
04:58:36.470 --> 04:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
bill if enacted will be one of the tools
 
04:58:38.990 --> 04:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
to create more housing
 
04:58:41.868 --> 04:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
by allowing more accessory dwelling
 
04:58:45.288 --> 04:58:45.298 align:start position:0%
units on single-family Lots this bill
 
04:58:48.590 --> 04:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
will help to build affordable housing
 
04:58:52.448 --> 04:58:52.458 align:start position:0%
for people for all ages
 
04:58:52.458 --> 04:58:54.250 align:start position:0%
for people for all ages
including

04:58:54.250 --> 04:58:54.260 align:start position:0%
including
 
04:58:57.410 --> 04:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
I should say allowing homeowners to add
 
04:59:00.948 --> 04:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
apartments for seniors like our parents
 
04:59:03.170 --> 04:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
and grandparents
 
04:59:05.570 --> 04:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
as well as young people like our
 
04:59:08.530 --> 04:59:08.540 align:start position:0%
children who are coming back to college
 
04:59:13.430 --> 04:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
with severe debt and want to establish a
 
04:59:19.490 --> 04:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:22.250 --> 04:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
an accessory dwelling unit would have to
 
04:59:24.350 --> 04:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
comply with the municipal zoning
 
04:59:27.230 --> 04:59:27.240 align:start position:0%

dwelling units including setbacks and
 
04:59:33.890 --> 04:59:33.900 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker I'm sorry I asked for a

division vote
 
05:00:31.970 --> 05:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:35.330 --> 05:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker good afternoon
 
05:00:37.670 --> 05:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
as you're well aware this is now a uh
 
05:00:39.708 --> 05:00:39.718 align:start position:0%
the third in a series of bills that
 
05:00:42.590 --> 05:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
attempts to place State mandates by
 
05:00:45.410 --> 05:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
Central planners in this case this body
 
05:00:48.830 --> 05:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
upon all the municipalities in our state
 
05:00:51.890 --> 05:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
the bill would require any property that
 
05:00:53.810 --> 05:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
currently allows a single accessory
 
05:00:55.368 --> 05:00:55.378 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit
 
05:00:58.190 --> 05:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
to now allow two and it also increases
 
05:01:01.128 --> 05:01:01.138 align:start position:0%
the size of those units just like we
 
05:01:02.750 --> 05:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
discussed on these other two bills I'm
 
05:01:05.030 --> 05:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
not going to go through the long Litany
 
05:01:07.128 --> 05:01:07.138 align:start position:0%
of items as to why we don't need to do
 
05:01:10.910 --> 05:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
it but towns and cities already have the
 
05:01:13.070 --> 05:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
ability to accomplish what this bill
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
tries to do and they can do that through
 
05:01:19.788 --> 05:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:22.788 --> 05:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
the new New Hampshire municipality
 
05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
Association has also confirmed that they
 
05:01:28.730 --> 05:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
are opposed to this bill specifically
 
05:01:32.030 --> 05:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
not unlike the other ones where anytime
 
05:01:34.670 --> 05:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
they try to put a universal mandate down
 
05:01:36.830 --> 05:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
onto a municipality they have been
 
05:01:39.170 --> 05:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
opposed and they are opposed to this one
 
05:01:39.180 --> 05:01:41.628 align:start position:0%
opposed and they are opposed to this one
also

05:01:41.628 --> 05:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:44.570 --> 05:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
finally the bill is laced once again
 
05:01:46.788 --> 05:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
legislation that's being forced upon the
 
05:01:49.190 --> 05:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities and mandated without
 
05:01:52.010 --> 05:01:52.020 align:start position:0%
regard to any fiscal or social impacts
 
05:01:54.830 --> 05:01:54.840 align:start position:0%

05:09:36.170 --> 05:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:38.208 --> 05:09:38.218 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
05:09:40.190 --> 05:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
know that in committee
 
05:09:42.530 --> 05:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
this bill was reconsidered because there
 
05:09:44.930 --> 05:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
was an appetite to try to find a
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisan compromise
 
05:09:50.150 --> 05:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
if I also know that that by attempt at
 
05:09:53.030 --> 05:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisan compromise failed
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
indicating that this bill needs
 
05:09:58.550 --> 05:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:00.410 --> 05:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
if I know that
 
05:10:04.910 --> 05:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:10:07.670 --> 05:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
as it's currently written is confusing
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
in many ways
 
05:10:11.390 --> 05:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
when I press the green button to table
 
05:10:14.208 --> 05:10:14.218 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:10:17.270 --> 05:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
is representative McGee
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
05:10:22.250 --> 05:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
bill has come up for a second time in
 
05:10:24.410 --> 05:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
our committee because there is a need
 
05:10:27.288 --> 05:10:27.298 align:start position:0%
between committees to be able to partner
 
05:10:29.448 --> 05:10:29.458 align:start position:0%
on solar projects
 
05:10:31.610 --> 05:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
and that the need has come up to our
 
05:10:33.288 --> 05:10:33.298 align:start position:0%
committee for consideration and for
 
05:10:36.770 --> 05:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
solution multiple times and it is a very
 
05:10:39.590 --> 05:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
small and simple change that says that a
 
05:10:41.510 --> 05:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
municipal host does not have to just be
 
05:10:44.868 --> 05:10:44.878 align:start position:0%
in one municipality but bordering towns
 
05:10:47.570 --> 05:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
can put in on projects together in order
 
05:10:50.090 --> 05:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
to lower their costs and would I now
 
05:10:51.770 --> 05:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
allow the debate to go forward so you
 
05:10:55.430 --> 05:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
can hear the point thanks
 
05:10:57.590 --> 05:10:57.600 align:start position:0%

139
 
05:13:06.890 --> 05:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
our electrical grid is a marvelous
 
05:13:09.650 --> 05:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
machine that looked that took decades to
 
05:13:11.390 --> 05:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
build and perfect
 
05:13:13.730 --> 05:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
tampering with or adjusting that machine
 
05:13:15.948 --> 05:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
requires careful deliberation and
 
05:13:15.958 --> 05:13:17.150 align:start position:0%
requires careful deliberation and
planning

05:13:17.150 --> 05:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
planning
 
05:13:19.730 --> 05:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
renewable generation of electricity has
 
05:13:21.288 --> 05:13:21.298 align:start position:0%
many pluses
 
05:13:24.410 --> 05:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
but its intermittency can destabilize
 
05:13:25.970 --> 05:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
the grid
 
05:13:28.368 --> 05:13:28.378 align:start position:0%
it needs to be expanded in small
 
05:13:31.070 --> 05:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
carefully planned increments to avoid
 
05:13:34.128 --> 05:13:34.138 align:start position:0%
causing disruptions in Supply and spike
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
in prices
 
05:13:39.470 --> 05:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
in 2021 New Hampshire expanded its net
 
05:13:41.810 --> 05:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
metering program to include counties and
 
05:13:41.820 --> 05:13:43.610 align:start position:0%
metering program to include counties and
municipalities

05:13:43.610 --> 05:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
05:13:45.830 --> 05:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
this modest expansion was good for
 
05:13:48.830 --> 05:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers even though it did shift some
 
05:13:50.930 --> 05:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
costs to ratepayers
 
05:13:53.448 --> 05:13:53.458 align:start position:0%
it demonstrated how growing Renewables
 
05:13:56.448 --> 05:13:56.458 align:start position:0%
on the grid can be done at a careful and
 
05:13:58.368 --> 05:13:58.378 align:start position:0%
deliberate pace
 
05:14:00.050 --> 05:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
for example
 
05:14:03.590 --> 05:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
in Rockingham County in which I serve
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
the new County complex being built over
 
05:14:09.830 --> 05:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
the next two years will feature a 4.99
 
05:14:12.830 --> 05:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
megawatt solar farm that will power the
 
05:14:15.890 --> 05:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
entire complex including the nursing
 
05:14:18.770 --> 05:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
home the jail and the new home of the
 
05:14:20.690 --> 05:14:20.700 align:start position:0%
administrative offices of the County
 
05:14:23.628 --> 05:14:23.638 align:start position:0%
Attorney register of deeds and other
 
05:14:23.638 --> 05:14:25.310 align:start position:0%
Attorney register of deeds and other
departments

05:14:25.310 --> 05:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
departments
 
05:14:27.830 --> 05:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
this project will use the municipal host
 
05:14:30.530 --> 05:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
group net metering program to provide
 
05:14:34.810 --> 05:14:34.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:36.948 --> 05:14:36.958 align:start position:0%
hb139 however
 
05:14:39.470 --> 05:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
takes a haphazard approach to expanding
 
05:14:42.230 --> 05:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
Renewables by removing one of the
 
05:14:44.448 --> 05:14:44.458 align:start position:0%
safeguards put in place to manage net
 
05:14:47.270 --> 05:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
metering growth allowing systems to
 
05:14:49.910 --> 05:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
cross Municipal boundaries will likely
 
05:14:53.208 --> 05:14:53.218 align:start position:0%
lead to a sharp uptick in large systems
 
05:14:56.090 --> 05:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
that serve towns that located near one
 
05:14:56.100 --> 05:14:57.350 align:start position:0%
that serve towns that located near one
another

05:14:57.350 --> 05:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:14:59.510 --> 05:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
these large systems will be built by
 
05:15:02.150 --> 05:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
private companies whose motive will be
 
05:15:04.010 --> 05:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
to Garner profits and more government
 
05:15:04.020 --> 05:15:05.868 align:start position:0%
to Garner profits and more government
subsidies

05:15:05.868 --> 05:15:05.878 align:start position:0%
subsidies
 
05:15:08.330 --> 05:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
a more careful and deliberate expansion
 
05:15:11.030 --> 05:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
could permit adjoining towns to create
 
05:15:14.390 --> 05:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
Municipal and net metering groups
 
05:15:17.330 --> 05:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
groups based on neighboring towns would
 
05:15:20.448 --> 05:15:20.458 align:start position:0%
likely be smaller and provide for modest
 
05:15:23.810 --> 05:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
and manageable net metering expansion
 
05:15:27.230 --> 05:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
since hb139 does not offer this approach
 
05:15:29.690 --> 05:15:29.700 align:start position:0%
it does not offer a carefully planned
 
05:15:32.030 --> 05:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
increment to this program
 
05:15:34.670 --> 05:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
in addition the Public Utilities
 
05:15:36.890 --> 05:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
Commission is currently deliberating
 
05:15:40.190 --> 05:15:40.200 align:start position:0%
changes to the net metering program
 
05:15:42.310 --> 05:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
that's why the department of energy
 
05:15:44.690 --> 05:15:44.700 align:start position:0%
opposes this bill as well
 
05:15:47.330 --> 05:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
therefore I urge you to vote no on the
 
05:15:49.430 --> 05:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
ought to pass motion so that a better
 
05:15:50.868 --> 05:15:50.878 align:start position:0%
motion can be made
 
05:15:53.330 --> 05:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:56.090 --> 05:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
remember yield to questions
 
05:15:56.100 --> 05:15:57.110 align:start position:0%
remember yield to questions
yes

05:15:57.110 --> 05:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:15:59.330 --> 05:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
remember yields you may inquire
 
05:16:00.708 --> 05:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
05:16:02.448 --> 05:16:02.458 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question would
 
05:16:04.368 --> 05:16:04.378 align:start position:0%
you also agree that this bill greatly
 
05:16:06.650 --> 05:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
expands the scope of the net metering
 
05:16:09.830 --> 05:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
the net metering Municipal host because
 
05:16:11.750 --> 05:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
it brings in things like housing
 
05:16:13.850 --> 05:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
authorities peas Development Authority
 
05:16:16.910 --> 05:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
and any other organization that's funded
 
05:16:18.830 --> 05:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
by a municipality for whatever reasons
 
05:16:21.170 --> 05:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
this is a huge expansion to this program
 
05:16:25.190 --> 05:16:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:26.930 --> 05:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
that's correct representative I agree
 
05:16:28.910 --> 05:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
with you
 
05:16:30.230 --> 05:16:30.240 align:start position:0%

05:16:36.708 --> 05:16:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:39.708 --> 05:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker so this is a very
 
05:16:41.930 --> 05:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
simple bill that extends the many
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
benefits of Municipal net metering but
 
05:16:46.670 --> 05:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
my colleague very kindly described for
 
05:16:49.368 --> 05:16:49.378 align:start position:0%
us the most important thing that it does
 
05:16:51.770 --> 05:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
it just removes the language requiring
 
05:16:54.110 --> 05:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
the users of the energy to be all in one
 
05:16:57.770 --> 05:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
municipality so there are many towns in
 
05:16:59.990 --> 05:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that have sites that might
 
05:17:01.310 --> 05:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
like to
 
05:17:01.320 --> 05:17:02.030 align:start position:0%
like to
um

05:17:02.030 --> 05:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:04.430 --> 05:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
sorry that might have enough space
 
05:17:06.470 --> 05:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
available for a large facility but might
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
not have enough off takers to take all
 
05:17:10.730 --> 05:17:10.740 align:start position:0%
the power that they would generate maybe
 
05:17:12.230 --> 05:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
their neighbor
 
05:17:14.270 --> 05:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
um has some use for the power but not
 
05:17:17.570 --> 05:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
space to create a facility so this bill
 
05:17:19.070 --> 05:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
would simply allow them to enter an
 
05:17:21.170 --> 05:17:21.180 align:start position:0%
agreement with a neighboring town or
 
05:17:23.330 --> 05:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
city that doesn't have that space But
 
05:17:24.650 --> 05:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
would like to reap the benefits of
 
05:17:27.230 --> 05:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
renewable generation this just allows
 
05:17:29.030 --> 05:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
more flexibility for our cities and
 
05:17:32.090 --> 05:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
towns to develop local energy in a way
 
05:17:34.128 --> 05:17:34.138 align:start position:0%
that works best for them saves where you
 
05:17:37.128 --> 05:17:37.138 align:start position:0%
pay our money saves Municipal money and
 
05:17:38.868 --> 05:17:38.878 align:start position:0%
costs nothing to the state
 
05:17:40.910 --> 05:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
and yes the other aspect of this bill is
 
05:17:43.070 --> 05:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
that it adds housing authorities the
 
05:17:45.530 --> 05:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
peace development and other quasi-public
 
05:17:48.530 --> 05:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
entities again to make a very measured
 
05:17:51.110 --> 05:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
small expansion of this very successful
 
05:17:53.090 --> 05:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
and popular program to a few more
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
governmental units I hope you will
 
05:17:56.628 --> 05:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
support this very reasonable modest
 
05:17:58.730 --> 05:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
expansion of Municipal net metering
 
05:18:00.770 --> 05:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:18:02.810 --> 05:18:02.820 align:start position:0%

the motion before us is auto pass and
 
05:19:46.250 --> 05:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
House Bill 139 this is a roll call vote
 
05:19:48.470 --> 05:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
which Eric and Ice representative wolves
 
05:19:52.128 --> 05:19:52.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:54.708 --> 05:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:19:56.690 --> 05:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that this bill
 
05:19:59.690 --> 05:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
removes the guard rails created by this
 
05:20:02.750 --> 05:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
body that prevent runaway growth in the
 
05:20:04.670 --> 05:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
municipal host group net metering
 
05:20:04.680 --> 05:20:06.650 align:start position:0%
municipal host group net metering
program

05:20:06.650 --> 05:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:20:08.510 --> 05:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
if I also know that removing this
 
05:20:10.730 --> 05:20:10.740 align:start position:0%
protection will derail the deliberate
 
05:20:13.010 --> 05:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
and well-planned Adoption of renewable
 
05:20:13.020 --> 05:20:14.270 align:start position:0%
and well-planned Adoption of renewable
energy

05:20:14.270 --> 05:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
energy
 
05:20:16.850 --> 05:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
too much of which can destabilize the
 
05:20:20.628 --> 05:20:20.638 align:start position:0%
grid and increase costs
 
05:20:22.910 --> 05:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
finally if I know that haphazard
 
05:20:25.490 --> 05:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
policies like hb-139 can lead to
 
05:20:28.430 --> 05:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences like the current
 
05:20:30.530 --> 05:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
interconnection backlog in Massachusetts
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
that will take years and tens of
 
05:20:36.530 --> 05:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to clear
 
05:20:39.530 --> 05:20:39.540 align:start position:0%
when I now press the red button to reply
 
05:20:41.690 --> 05:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
to protect the reliability of our grid
 
05:20:44.330 --> 05:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
and keep electricity prices as low as
 
05:20:46.610 --> 05:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
possible thank you Mr Speaker chair
 
05:20:48.110 --> 05:20:48.120 align:start position:0%

05:20:55.010 --> 05:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:20:58.490 --> 05:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that Municipal net
 
05:21:02.208 --> 05:21:02.218 align:start position:0%
metering Municipal net metering
 
05:21:04.610 --> 05:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
benefits all the taxpayers of a
 
05:21:08.208 --> 05:21:08.218 align:start position:0%
municipality by lowering Municipal
 
05:21:09.770 --> 05:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
energy costs
 
05:21:12.170 --> 05:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill makes it
 
05:21:14.330 --> 05:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
possible to expand Municipal net
 
05:21:17.030 --> 05:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
metering then Mr Speaker would I press

05:25:50.990 --> 05:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker just a little
 
05:25:52.850 --> 05:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
background on this in case those people
 
05:25:54.530 --> 05:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
don't realize it everyone gets an
 
05:25:56.150 --> 05:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
electric bill most people get it from
 
05:25:58.070 --> 05:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
eversource if you get one there's a
 
05:25:59.030 --> 05:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
little thing you'll see they're called
 
05:26:01.970 --> 05:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
Stranded cost the overwhelming majority
 
05:26:03.770 --> 05:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
stranded costs the money that you're
 
05:26:06.410 --> 05:26:06.420 align:start position:0%
subsidizing the burgers by biomass plant
 
05:26:09.350 --> 05:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
with they pursued and signed a contract
 
05:26:11.990 --> 05:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
some years ago with eversource they
 
05:26:13.250 --> 05:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
wanted it they couldn't have built their
 
05:26:15.830 --> 05:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
plant without it and in there there was
 
05:26:17.390 --> 05:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
a strike price of eighty dollars a
 
05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour by that I mean they get
 
05:26:22.190 --> 05:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
paid eighty dollars a megawatt hour from
 
05:26:23.810 --> 05:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
eversource which means from the rate
 
05:26:25.730 --> 05:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
payers eversource just passes the cost
 
05:26:28.368 --> 05:26:28.378 align:start position:0%
through 100 it costs them nothing
 
05:26:30.830 --> 05:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
and if the actual market price of
 
05:26:33.410 --> 05:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
electricity during any given hour is
 
05:26:37.010 --> 05:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
above that then Burgess gets a credit if
 
05:26:39.350 --> 05:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's below that they get a charge well
 
05:26:41.090 --> 05:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
over the last approximately 10 years
 
05:26:44.230 --> 05:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
they've racked up a lot of charges about
 
05:26:47.868 --> 05:26:47.878 align:start position:0%
150 million dollars worth of charges
 
05:26:49.788 --> 05:26:49.798 align:start position:0%
to put that in perspective I think
 
05:26:52.550 --> 05:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
everyone realizes last January we had
 
05:26:56.448 --> 05:26:56.458 align:start position:0%
very very high uh Market rates what
 
05:26:58.810 --> 05:26:58.820 align:start position:0%
retail as well as
 
05:27:02.090 --> 05:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
market-based wholesale rates if they ran
 
05:27:05.150 --> 05:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
in January for one day if they ran 24
 
05:27:07.550 --> 05:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
hours on an average January day they
 
05:27:09.590 --> 05:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
would have racked up about 30 thousand
 
05:27:12.050 --> 05:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
dollars in charges because the market
 
05:27:15.470 --> 05:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
rate in January was averaged about 55 a
 
05:27:17.270 --> 05:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour even though it was one of
 
05:27:19.750 --> 05:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
the highest we've ever had it was 25
 
05:27:23.330 --> 05:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
below the rate that was negotiated by
 
05:27:26.570 --> 05:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
Burgess biomass so what it comes down to
 
05:27:28.190 --> 05:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
is they've signed a contract they don't
 
05:27:29.690 --> 05:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
want to live up to
 
05:27:31.730 --> 05:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
they never have and never will be able
 
05:27:33.770 --> 05:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
to make the terms of the contract so
 
05:27:36.288 --> 05:27:36.298 align:start position:0%
it's time to stop the bleeding they've
 
05:27:38.570 --> 05:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
we brought this up a year and a half ago
 
05:27:40.128 --> 05:27:40.138 align:start position:0%
and asked them to come forward with the
 
05:27:41.750 --> 05:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
plan be ready to come back with how are
 
05:27:43.610 --> 05:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
you going to deal with this because the
 
05:27:44.990 --> 05:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
electric prices even though they've gone
 
05:27:46.788 --> 05:27:46.798 align:start position:0%
up substantially have not gone up
 
05:27:49.128 --> 05:27:49.138 align:start position:0%
anywhere enough to cover the cost of
 
05:27:51.350 --> 05:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
that eighty dollars a megawatt hour they
 
05:27:52.910 --> 05:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
came back in the hearings we had
 
05:27:55.670 --> 05:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
recently and had nothing to say they had
 
05:27:58.250 --> 05:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
no plan no option just one
 
05:28:01.070 --> 05:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
representative who was from that area in
 
05:28:03.050 --> 05:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
the Berlin area said we'll be back next
 
05:28:05.030 --> 05:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
year requesting more money and that's
 
05:28:06.350 --> 05:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
the only way they're going to stay
 
05:28:06.360 --> 05:28:07.610 align:start position:0%
the only way they're going to stay
afloat

05:28:07.610 --> 05:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
afloat
 
05:28:10.010 --> 05:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
they the bill does nothing to address
 
05:28:13.788 --> 05:28:13.798 align:start position:0%
the real cause that 80 is still there it
 
05:28:15.708 --> 05:28:15.718 align:start position:0%
simply says well we're going to knock
 
05:28:18.288 --> 05:28:18.298 align:start position:0%
off 50 million dollars of the 150 that
 
05:28:19.970 --> 05:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
the rate pays have already shelled out
 
05:28:22.910 --> 05:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
and not require them to pay that back it
 
05:28:24.948 --> 05:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't do anything to prevent the
 
05:28:27.410 --> 05:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
inevitable bankruptcy of this company if
 
05:28:31.010 --> 05:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
indeed they go they keep going the only
 
05:28:33.050 --> 05:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
possibility is they could sell the plant
 
05:28:34.490 --> 05:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
it's happened to other plants the
 
05:28:36.650 --> 05:28:36.660 align:start position:0%
Londonderry gas-fired plant which is
 
05:28:38.448 --> 05:28:38.458 align:start position:0%
more than 10 times bigger than this
 
05:28:40.850 --> 05:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
plant uh went bankrupt and they were
 
05:28:42.470 --> 05:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
sold for cents on the dollar it's up
 
05:28:44.868 --> 05:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
running now and making a profit I don't
 
05:28:46.730 --> 05:28:46.740 align:start position:0%
can't sit here and stand in front of you
 
05:28:48.170 --> 05:28:48.180 align:start position:0%
and say that that could happen for
 
05:28:50.390 --> 05:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
Burgess but it might be able to happen
 
05:28:52.610 --> 05:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
but I can guarantee you if they continue
 
05:28:54.650 --> 05:28:54.660 align:start position:0%
to run all they're going to do is rack
 
05:28:57.770 --> 05:28:57.780 align:start position:0%
up more money what the bill says is give
 
05:29:00.110 --> 05:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
them 50 million dollars of rate payer
 
05:29:01.788 --> 05:29:01.798 align:start position:0%
money that they get to keep but then
 
05:29:03.170 --> 05:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to start paying it
 
05:29:04.730 --> 05:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
back in accordance with the contract
 
05:29:08.270 --> 05:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
they can't do it so we'll will be back
 
05:29:09.770 --> 05:29:09.780 align:start position:0%
here a year from now and they'll be
 
05:29:11.628 --> 05:29:11.638 align:start position:0%
begging for more money because they have
 
05:29:13.730 --> 05:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
no other option they have no there's no
 
05:29:14.930 --> 05:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
way of doing it they can try
 
05:29:16.850 --> 05:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
renegotiating the contract but I don't
 
05:29:18.708 --> 05:29:18.718 align:start position:0%
think that's going to work there's no
 
05:29:20.690 --> 05:29:20.700 align:start position:0%
nothing forces ever source to do it
 
05:29:22.368 --> 05:29:22.378 align:start position:0%
remember this was a voluntary contract
 
05:29:24.770 --> 05:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
by two parties no one made either side
 
05:29:28.490 --> 05:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
sign it so what would happen if we knock
 
05:29:30.288 --> 05:29:30.298 align:start position:0%
them back to 100 million dollars it's
 
05:29:32.208 --> 05:29:32.218 align:start position:0%
just going to delay the inevitable a
 
05:29:33.948 --> 05:29:33.958 align:start position:0%
little bit longer because they'll be
 
05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
racking up that build and once it goes
 
05:29:37.850 --> 05:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
over 100 million they have to start
 
05:29:39.470 --> 05:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
paying the money back to the to the rate
 
05:29:42.110 --> 05:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
payers and they simply can't do it so
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
let's stop the bleeding let's put this
 
05:29:46.250 --> 05:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
to an end if they have to go bankrupt if
 
05:29:47.690 --> 05:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
they have to sell the plant whatever the
 
05:29:49.368 --> 05:29:49.378 align:start position:0%
sooner the better because the longer
 
05:29:50.868 --> 05:29:50.878 align:start position:0%
that plant operates the more they're
 
05:29:52.490 --> 05:29:52.500 align:start position:0%
going to owe the rate payers is they
 
05:29:54.830 --> 05:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
can't pay back so if you like paying
 
05:29:57.230 --> 05:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
that cost in the stranded cost in your
 
05:29:59.270 --> 05:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
electric bill and by all means vote in
 
05:30:01.788 --> 05:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill but if you say 150
 
05:30:03.890 --> 05:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
million dollars is enough and it's time
 
05:30:06.230 --> 05:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
to stop the bleeding please push the red
 
05:30:08.448 --> 05:30:08.458 align:start position:0%
button thank you
 
05:30:15.350 --> 05:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:15.360 --> 05:30:17.090 align:start position:0%
 
speaker

05:30:17.090 --> 05:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
05:30:18.590 --> 05:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
when I was growing up
 
05:30:20.510 --> 05:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
my mother and father taught me that it's
 
05:30:22.788 --> 05:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
okay to make mistakes
 
05:30:24.350 --> 05:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
but if you do make a mistake you should
 
05:30:25.610 --> 05:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
admit it
 
05:30:28.070 --> 05:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
apologize for it if necessary fix it if
 
05:30:29.030 --> 05:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
you can
 
05:30:32.390 --> 05:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:34.788 --> 05:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
in 2018
 
05:30:37.970 --> 05:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
this legislature and our governor
 
05:30:40.788 --> 05:30:40.798 align:start position:0%
made a mistake
 
05:30:45.470 --> 05:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
they passed Senate Bill 577
 
05:30:49.310 --> 05:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
which granted a suspension of the terms
 
05:30:52.250 --> 05:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
of a contract negotiated between two
 
05:30:54.830 --> 05:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
private companies
 
05:30:57.890 --> 05:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
for a period of three years
 
05:30:59.330 --> 05:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:31:02.570 --> 05:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 271 which we all approved
 
05:31:02.580 --> 05:31:04.970 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 271 which we all approved
extended

05:31:04.970 --> 05:31:04.980 align:start position:0%
extended
 
05:31:11.208 --> 05:31:11.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:13.368 --> 05:31:13.378 align:start position:0%
in November of this year that suspension
 
05:31:13.378 --> 05:31:17.208 align:start position:0%
in November of this year that suspension
expires

05:31:17.208 --> 05:31:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:20.390 --> 05:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
what happens then according to the terms
 
05:31:22.250 --> 05:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
of the contract that the two parties
 
05:31:24.470 --> 05:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
signed and I'm talking about
 
05:31:28.368 --> 05:31:28.378 align:start position:0%
eversource the utility and Burgess power
 
05:31:30.890 --> 05:31:30.900 align:start position:0%
the wood burning generating plant and
 
05:31:30.900 --> 05:31:32.270 align:start position:0%
the wood burning generating plant and
Berlin

05:31:32.270 --> 05:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
Berlin
 
05:31:33.770 --> 05:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
what happens at the end of the
 
05:31:37.490 --> 05:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
suspension period is that Berlin has to
 
05:31:40.190 --> 05:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:42.350 --> 05:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
all the money that is accumulated during
 
05:31:44.868 --> 05:31:44.878 align:start position:0%
that four-year suspension period they've
 
05:31:46.910 --> 05:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
said they they can't do that
 
05:31:48.890 --> 05:31:48.900 align:start position:0%
and an independent audit by the
 
05:31:50.990 --> 05:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
department of energy which was part of
 
05:31:54.410 --> 05:31:54.420 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 271 last year confirmed that
 
05:31:56.090 --> 05:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
they don't have the financial resources
 
05:32:01.730 --> 05:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:03.650 --> 05:32:03.660 align:start position:0%
so it's clear now and I realize that
 
05:32:07.670 --> 05:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
hindsight is 2020 but it's clear now
 
05:32:09.708 --> 05:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
that it was a mistake for the
 
05:32:11.930 --> 05:32:11.940 align:start position:0%
legislature to get involved in this
 
05:32:14.868 --> 05:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
process in the first place
 
05:32:17.448 --> 05:32:17.458 align:start position:0%
that four-year suspension allowed 50
 
05:32:19.910 --> 05:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars to accumulate
 
05:32:22.010 --> 05:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
that now suddenly
 
05:32:24.530 --> 05:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
needs to be paid back according to the
 
05:32:26.090 --> 05:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and the
 
05:32:28.788 --> 05:32:28.798 align:start position:0%
terms of the contract
 
05:32:32.810 --> 05:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:35.270 --> 05:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
the purpose of House Bill 122 is amended
 
05:32:36.470 --> 05:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
by the committee
 
05:32:39.470 --> 05:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
is to admit that we made a mistake
 
05:32:41.150 --> 05:32:41.160 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't have created that four-year
 
05:32:43.610 --> 05:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
suspension period which allowed 50
 
05:32:45.650 --> 05:32:45.660 align:start position:0%
million dollars in over-market charges
 
05:32:48.170 --> 05:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
to accumulate
 
05:32:50.448 --> 05:32:50.458 align:start position:0%
and put the commit to put the company
 
05:32:54.170 --> 05:32:54.180 align:start position:0%
Berlin Burgess biopower in Jeopardy
 
05:32:58.850 --> 05:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:01.010 --> 05:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
so this bill is amended by the committee
 
05:33:04.910 --> 05:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
forgives that over-market accumulation
 
05:33:07.970 --> 05:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
of over-market charges which amounts to
 
05:33:11.390 --> 05:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
roughly 48 to 50 million dollars it's
 
05:33:13.250 --> 05:33:13.260 align:start position:0%
already been recovered from ratepayers
 
05:33:16.010 --> 05:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
so it's not like it's a new
 
05:33:20.390 --> 05:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
obligation that we'll have to discharge
 
05:33:23.448 --> 05:33:23.458 align:start position:0%
it simply forgives
 
05:33:26.628 --> 05:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
the company Burgess biopower from their
 
05:33:28.430 --> 05:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
obligation under the terms of their
 
05:33:31.970 --> 05:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
contract to pay it back
 
05:33:35.570 --> 05:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
it essentially resets the terms of the
 
05:33:38.090 --> 05:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
PPA that they signed
 
05:33:42.110 --> 05:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
to 2018 before this suspension went into
 
05:33:42.120 --> 05:33:45.530 align:start position:0%
to 2018 before this suspension went into
effect

05:33:45.530 --> 05:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:49.128 --> 05:33:49.138 align:start position:0%
now Burgess signed that contract
 
05:33:53.868 --> 05:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:56.330 --> 05:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
and we should allow them
 
05:33:58.310 --> 05:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
both parties here
 
05:34:01.730 --> 05:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
to live by the terms of this contract it
 
05:34:07.070 --> 05:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:09.948 --> 05:34:09.958 align:start position:0%
we must resist
 
05:34:13.250 --> 05:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
the Temptation I think to rescue every
 
05:34:16.970 --> 05:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
entity that makes a mistake
 
05:34:20.150 --> 05:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
whether that's a Silicon Valley Bank
 
05:34:22.070 --> 05:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
or a New Hampshire supplier of
 
05:34:22.080 --> 05:34:25.310 align:start position:0%
or a New Hampshire supplier of
electricity

05:34:25.310 --> 05:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:28.250 --> 05:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill and forgive this 48

05:34:35.390 --> 05:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
charges
 
05:34:37.490 --> 05:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
that accumulated only because this
 
05:34:40.550 --> 05:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
legislature intervened
 
05:34:44.510 --> 05:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
we will allow the parties to resume the
 
05:34:47.090 --> 05:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
performance of their contract
 
05:34:49.430 --> 05:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
however that works out
 
05:34:51.830 --> 05:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
will be between them and it's not
 
05:34:54.110 --> 05:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
something that we should get involved
 
05:34:54.120 --> 05:34:56.270 align:start position:0%
something that we should get involved
with

05:34:56.270 --> 05:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:34:57.530 --> 05:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
but I think
 
05:35:00.590 --> 05:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
that by passing this legislation we give
 
05:35:03.530 --> 05:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
them a chance we throw them a Lifeline
 
05:35:05.510 --> 05:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
that says okay
 
05:35:07.250 --> 05:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
now you've got to live by the terms of
 
05:35:09.470 --> 05:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
your contract if it's not going to work
 
05:35:11.570 --> 05:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
then maybe you need to re renegotiate
 
05:35:13.490 --> 05:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
that contract
 
05:35:17.090 --> 05:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
by passing this bill we will extend a
 
05:35:17.100 --> 05:35:18.288 align:start position:0%
by passing this bill we will extend a
lifeline

05:35:18.288 --> 05:35:18.298 align:start position:0%
lifeline
 
05:35:20.390 --> 05:35:20.400 align:start position:0%

05:35:21.470 --> 05:35:21.480 align:start position:0%

05:47:02.150 --> 05:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you speaker
 
05:47:04.070 --> 05:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
the house will be in order the member
 
05:47:06.048 --> 05:47:06.058 align:start position:0%
has a right to be heard
 
05:47:07.730 --> 05:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
all right I know it's late so just be
 
05:47:09.948 --> 05:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
real quick at this North Dakota has had
 
05:47:12.948 --> 05:47:12.958 align:start position:0%
its own public Bank since 1919. this
 
05:47:14.750 --> 05:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
bank takes tax revenue from the state
 
05:47:16.730 --> 05:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
and then reinvests it in the state
 
05:47:19.368 --> 05:47:19.378 align:start position:0%
keeping the money local
 
05:47:19.378 --> 05:47:21.650 align:start position:0%
keeping the money local
system

05:47:21.650 --> 05:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:47:23.570 --> 05:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
when you build a bridge or public other
 
05:47:25.010 --> 05:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
public infrastructure half the cost of
 
05:47:26.570 --> 05:47:26.580 align:start position:0%
that project goes to interest payments
 
05:47:28.850 --> 05:47:28.860 align:start position:0%
to the mega Corporation Banks and I just
 
05:47:30.350 --> 05:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
don't see any reason we need to do that
 
05:47:32.510 --> 05:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to keep this in our toolkit
 
05:47:35.270 --> 05:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
so that the banks are collapsing right
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
now we kind of know what's going on and
 
05:47:38.090 --> 05:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
we can kind of lie and say oh they're
 
05:47:39.890 --> 05:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
all safe they're not and there's
 
05:47:41.570 --> 05:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
actually no Reserve requirement right
 
05:47:44.448 --> 05:47:44.458 align:start position:0%
now for banks for the banks so
 
05:47:45.890 --> 05:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
there's no need for them to keep any
 
05:47:47.390 --> 05:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
money in their vault they just keep on
 
05:47:48.948 --> 05:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
asking the feds for more and more and as
 
05:47:50.390 --> 05:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
we know the printing presses keep going
 
05:47:53.570 --> 05:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
verb so
 
05:47:54.890 --> 05:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
I don't want to take a whole bunch of
 
05:47:56.208 --> 05:47:56.218 align:start position:0%
time just going to say last thing is
 
05:47:58.788 --> 05:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
this public Bank does not compete with
 
05:48:01.788 --> 05:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
local banks so North Dakota is 12 banks
 
05:48:04.490 --> 05:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
for every 100 000 people per capita and
 
05:48:06.288 --> 05:48:06.298 align:start position:0%
the U.S average is two
 
05:48:09.830 --> 05:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
so if we're really trying to
 
05:48:12.410 --> 05:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
help the people of New Hampshire and
 
05:48:14.270 --> 05:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
keep our costs down
 
05:48:16.368 --> 05:48:16.378 align:start position:0%
and not just burn money on these banks
 
05:48:18.470 --> 05:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
are going to take our tax dollars and
 
05:48:20.690 --> 05:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
put them out of state then I would
 
05:48:23.270 --> 05:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
urge you guys to pass this Bill thank
 
05:48:23.280 --> 05:48:24.288 align:start position:0%
urge you guys to pass this Bill thank
you

05:48:24.288 --> 05:48:24.298 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:48:30.530 --> 05:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:32.390 --> 05:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:48:34.670 --> 05:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
um I uh this bill has been a perennial
 
05:48:36.110 --> 05:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
it's been kicking around for a number of
 
05:48:37.910 --> 05:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
years with a wide variety of sponsors
 
05:48:40.490 --> 05:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
and I've sponsored it I've co-sponsored
 
05:48:42.048 --> 05:48:42.058 align:start position:0%
it a few times I thank the member from
 
05:48:44.448 --> 05:48:44.458 align:start position:0%
Northfield for stepping forward it uh
 
05:48:46.310 --> 05:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
seems more timely than they did last
 
05:48:48.410 --> 05:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
year with the growing instability in the
 
05:48:50.868 --> 05:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
banking industry especially the failure
 
05:48:53.690 --> 05:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
of the high-flying Silicon Valley Bank
 
05:48:55.610 --> 05:48:55.620 align:start position:0%
and he pretty much
 
05:48:57.650 --> 05:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
summed everything up all I really need
 
05:48:59.868 --> 05:48:59.878 align:start position:0%
to add is that it's it's a fairly well I
 
05:49:01.368 --> 05:49:01.378 align:start position:0%
mean it's kind of a long Bill if you
 
05:49:02.810 --> 05:49:02.820 align:start position:0%
want to if you're anywhere trying to
 
05:49:04.310 --> 05:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
absorb it all on your phones while
 
05:49:05.750 --> 05:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're sitting here
 
05:49:08.208 --> 05:49:08.218 align:start position:0%
but it's uh short for the complication
 
05:49:12.110 --> 05:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
of the topic if passed as is all hb648
 
05:49:15.350 --> 05:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
does it establishes a board of directors
 
05:49:17.690 --> 05:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
and an accompanying advisory commission
 
05:49:20.930 --> 05:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
along with authorizing uh jail card The
 
05:49:22.310 --> 05:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
Joint legislative committee on
 
05:49:24.470 --> 05:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to begin the rule
 
05:49:26.090 --> 05:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
making process and the rules will
 
05:49:27.288 --> 05:49:27.298 align:start position:0%
presumably be
 
05:49:29.150 --> 05:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
quite voluminous
 
05:49:31.070 --> 05:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
and then the state treasurer and the
 
05:49:32.690 --> 05:49:32.700 align:start position:0%
bank commissioner and the Attorney
 
05:49:34.490 --> 05:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
General will be asked to write a startup
 
05:49:36.230 --> 05:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
plan and that would include
 
05:49:37.850 --> 05:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
recommendations there'd be a lot of
 
05:49:39.650 --> 05:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
future legislation needed to flesh out
 
05:49:42.288 --> 05:49:42.298 align:start position:0%
to start a plan so that's going to take
 
05:49:45.470 --> 05:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
several years so I if if you need to
 
05:49:47.628 --> 05:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
take my advice and overturn the itl if
 
05:49:49.190 --> 05:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
we actually passed it we'd just be
 
05:49:52.250 --> 05:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
starting a uh process that's going to
 
05:49:54.590 --> 05:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
take a whole bunch of several years and
 
05:49:57.410 --> 05:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
what is the Bank of North Dakota it's
 
05:49:59.448 --> 05:49:59.458 align:start position:0%
Unique but it has worked well in North
 
05:50:01.128 --> 05:50:01.138 align:start position:0%
Dakota I think we need something similar
 
05:50:03.948 --> 05:50:03.958 align:start position:0%
here so uh I urge you to overturn the
 
05:50:06.890 --> 05:50:06.900 align:start position:0%
itl some more appropriate motion can be
 
05:50:10.010 --> 05:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
introduced so thanks
 
05:50:11.690 --> 05:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
do you recognize representative by the
 
05:50:15.240 --> 05:50:15.250 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:15.250 --> 05:50:21.530 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

05:50:21.530 --> 05:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:24.170 --> 05:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:50:26.150 --> 05:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
I'm so glad I got a chance to speak in
 
05:50:28.128 --> 05:50:28.138 align:start position:0%
these last two days here
 
05:50:30.350 --> 05:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
I was asked to table this bill and I
 
05:50:32.750 --> 05:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
said no I think it's important that the
 
05:50:34.610 --> 05:50:34.620 align:start position:0%
people who who support the bill should
 
05:50:36.650 --> 05:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
have a chance to speak and let you know
 
05:50:38.448 --> 05:50:38.458 align:start position:0%
what they think and how they want this
 
05:50:41.570 --> 05:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
Bill yes it is true Commerce has seen
 
05:50:44.470 --> 05:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
this bill multiple times over the years
 
05:50:47.448 --> 05:50:47.458 align:start position:0%
and yes it is true the North Dakota did
 
05:50:48.910 --> 05:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
back in
 
05:50:54.590 --> 05:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
1919 did create a bank it was necessary
 
05:50:58.010 --> 05:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
for North Dakota at the time because the
 
05:51:02.208 --> 05:51:02.218 align:start position:0%
farmers were unable to get loans from
 
05:51:03.890 --> 05:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
the community from the banks that were
 
05:51:06.830 --> 05:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
in that time back then Banks didn't have
 
05:51:10.070 --> 05:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
Financial requirements they were pretty
 
05:51:12.110 --> 05:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
kind of loosey-goosey and evidently they
 
05:51:14.330 --> 05:51:14.340 align:start position:0%
weren't loan into farmers and so the
 
05:51:16.788 --> 05:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
state decided to step in in the meantime
 
05:51:19.910 --> 05:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire all the different
 
05:51:22.070 --> 05:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
benefits that that North Dakota Bank
 
05:51:25.190 --> 05:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
does provide to all those different the
 
05:51:27.530 --> 05:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
farmers but also to the citizens are
 
05:51:30.110 --> 05:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
actually right now being provided by
 
05:51:33.110 --> 05:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
nifa for student loans the business
 
05:51:35.150 --> 05:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority does business findings
 
05:51:38.030 --> 05:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
so we have all the same things that that
 
05:51:40.850 --> 05:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
bank does but we just operate it a
 
05:51:42.288 --> 05:51:42.298 align:start position:0%
little differently and as a matter of
 
05:51:44.930 --> 05:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
fact we do it like the other 48 states
 
05:51:48.410 --> 05:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
do it so I would urge you to vote with
 
05:51:50.570 --> 05:51:50.580 align:start position:0%

House Bill 277 on the table
 
05:53:58.788 --> 05:53:58.798 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a division vote the
 
05:54:00.350 --> 05:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes the representative Leon
 
05:54:06.530 --> 05:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:07.850 --> 05:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
05:54:09.470 --> 05:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
that may face few obstacles to
 
05:54:12.350 --> 05:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
vasectomies and yet women are sometimes
 
05:54:14.090 --> 05:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
denied medical care which results in
 
05:54:17.150 --> 05:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
sterilization because the doctor thinks
 
05:54:18.410 --> 05:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
that she might want to have children in
 
05:54:19.910 --> 05:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
the future and they think that that
 
05:54:22.010 --> 05:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
desire is actually more important than
 
05:54:23.510 --> 05:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
the medical condition
 
05:54:25.788 --> 05:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
and if I know that house bill 277
 
05:54:27.410 --> 05:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
attempted to right this wrong but we
 
05:54:29.628 --> 05:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
just couldn't get there in time and if I
 
05:54:31.548 --> 05:54:31.558 align:start position:0%

long day
 
05:59:41.448 --> 05:59:41.458 align:start position:0%
I stand before you for recognition of
 
05:59:44.090 --> 05:59:44.100 align:start position:0%

I stand with my education committee
 
05:59:47.570 --> 05:59:47.580 align:start position:0%

government
 
05:59:52.490 --> 05:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
and if I asked all of the women here to
 
05:59:54.470 --> 05:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
come down it would be about a third of
 
05:59:56.390 --> 05:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
the house and less people to be speaking
 
05:59:56.400 --> 05:59:57.708 align:start position:0%
the house and less people to be speaking
to

05:59:57.708 --> 05:59:57.718 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:59:59.448 --> 05:59:59.458 align:start position:0%
and if I asked all the men who value
 
06:00:01.610 --> 06:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
women in government I think we'd all be
 
06:00:02.990 --> 06:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
on this side of the podium at least I
 
06:00:04.548 --> 06:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
hope so
 
06:00:06.288 --> 06:00:06.298 align:start position:0%

history I ask you to also reflect on the
 
06:00:12.110 --> 06:00:12.120 align:start position:0%

06:00:14.750 --> 06:00:14.760 align:start position:0%

lasting contributions to women's rights
 
06:02:06.470 --> 06:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
when Ms Ricker announced her campaign

for governor in 1910 ten years before
 
06:02:13.190 --> 06:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
she acquired the right to vote
 
06:02:16.250 --> 06:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
she said I'm running for governor in
 
06:02:18.110 --> 06:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
order to get people in the habit of
 
06:02:20.090 --> 06:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
thinking of women as governors
 
06:02:21.948 --> 06:02:21.958 align:start position:0%
people have to about to think about a
 
06:02:23.990 --> 06:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
thing for several centuries before they
 
06:02:26.990 --> 06:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
got acclimated to the idea
 
06:02:30.708 --> 06:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
fortunately it did not take centuries
 
06:02:33.530 --> 06:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
in 1920 the 19th Amendment to the U.S
 
06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution confirmed women's right to

06:02:56.448 --> 06:02:56.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was the first state in the
 
06:02:58.190 --> 06:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
U.S to have an all-woman Congressional
 
06:03:01.128 --> 06:03:01.138 align:start position:0%
Delegation as you all know probably we
 
06:03:02.930 --> 06:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
were the first state to elect the same
 
06:03:04.788 --> 06:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
woman to be both governor and state
 
06:03:08.030 --> 06:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
senator which we have now done twice and
 
06:03:09.410 --> 06:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
I don't think any other state has done
 
06:03:14.868 --> 06:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:17.448 --> 06:03:17.458 align:start position:0%
all of this is not only good for women
 
06:03:20.090 --> 06:03:20.100 align:start position:0%
it is good for our country
 
06:03:22.128 --> 06:03:22.138 align:start position:0%
women's life experience are different
