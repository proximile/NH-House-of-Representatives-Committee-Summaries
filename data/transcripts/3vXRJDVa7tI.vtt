okay

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay the the 1235
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
contained portions
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.389 align:start position:0%
that uh
changed

00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
h frm the frm
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
was dealt with in hb2
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's been dealt with for several years
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
there's a section of law 359 p
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
that puts out all the details of of the
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
frm settlement fund
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
we changed it a little bit
 
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.149 align:start position:0%
we changed it a little bit
in

00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:31:52.159 --> 00:31:53.269 align:start position:0%
in
um

00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
hb2 we put the money in in hb2 we also
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
repealed the repeal so there's no
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
further action that i think needs to be
 
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.830 align:start position:0%
further action that i think needs to be
done

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:05.029 align:start position:0%
done
on

00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:32:05.039 --> 00:32:06.310 align:start position:0%
on
on

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
frm and the way that bill
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
was amended and the second amendment was
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
confusing so this is going to take all
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
that out and just leave in the bill as
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
it was intended to raise the forty
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
thousand to fifty thousand
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
for the victims of of uh violence and
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's the way the bill should be
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
cleaned just dealing with that issue
 
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.389 align:start position:0%
cleaned just dealing with that issue
so

00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
i moved the amendment
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
yeah we we had a first in a second
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
already uh representative walt
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
as one of the original sponsors of the
 
00:32:44.159 --> 00:32:45.430 align:start position:0%
as one of the original sponsors of the
bill

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
i would take issue with the fact of the
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
way the bill was originally intended i
 
00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
would argue that
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
the section that's being removed here
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
takes the residual part of whatever
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
money is left on frm and moves it to the
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
victims assistance fund if there is
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
money left that actually was part of the
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
original intention of the bill
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
because the original sponsor in this was
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
none other than the late representative
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
cushing and representative cushing often
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
said to me that we should never have
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
done a separate fund for the frm victims
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
because they're already existed in law
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
the victims compensation fund and they
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
were eligible to apply to the victims
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
compensation fund but chose not to and
 
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.190 align:start position:0%
compensation fund but chose not to and
so

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
they had a an approach of recovery
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
available to them
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
so his thought was is that since we put
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
this money in the
 
00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.389 align:start position:0%
this money in the
uh

00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
fund for the frm
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
and it really is a different form of a
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
victims compensation fund that any money
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
left over should go to the already
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
existing victims compensation fund that
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
does compensate other victims of crime
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
so i would suggest that the amendment
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
then guts the basic intention one of the
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
two basic intentions of the bill
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
and that is that it eliminates the
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
ability to take any residual money and
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
allow it to be used for other crime
 
00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:08.470 align:start position:0%
allow it to be used for other crime
victims

00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
represent weiler
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
i don't think there will be any
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
residuals so we shouldn't make that
 
00:34:14.879 --> 00:34:16.629 align:start position:0%
residuals so we shouldn't make that
anticipation

00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
anticipation
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
i think there's likely to be
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
may i respond
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
say something
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
and i think if we find out in a year or
 
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
so that there is a residual that's the
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
time to
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
do something thank you
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
may i respond
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
did you raise your hand
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative waltz you just
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
didn't see it um but i would suggest
 
00:34:46.629 --> 00:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
what is the harm in doing it now why is
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
there a problem with acknowledging now
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
that if there's money left it can go to
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
compensate other victims of crime you
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
would put this off later you know
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
obviously representative cushing's not
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
going to be here later others of us may
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
not be here this seems like as good a
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
time as any to do this and therefore i
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
oppose this amendment i think the bill
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
as it came to us
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
you know we are not a policy committee
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
this is effectively changing the policy
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
because there was a policy here to put
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
the money in for other crime victims
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's not just a financial issue it's a
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
policy issue and here we are once again
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
trying to make policy here and i would
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
argue it should be as it arrived to us
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
as a policy bill because this will have
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
no effect on the current expenditures of
 
00:35:32.069 --> 00:35:32.079 align:start position:0%
the state so i think this is just an
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
attempt to change policy and i oppose
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%

5. such expenses that are typically used
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
for this victims program include medical
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%

of participating in court
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
proceedings the ending
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
balance in the fund
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 2021 having looked at
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
the annual report for the program which
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
was issued last fall is close to a
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
so i believe it's the
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
intent of the division and hopefully
 
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
that the increase can be absorbed by
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
these available funds
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
and make mention of the fact that the
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
fund is funded by federal funds
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
restitution penalty grants and so on
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
no state funding there
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
so i would encourage my colleagues on
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote in favor of ought
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended on house bill 1235
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
are there any further comments represent
 
00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.150 align:start position:0%

00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
we can't go and consent because it
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
contains dollars

00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
question on that
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
as as it comes out of the committee it
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
it there's no change from what the house
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
has already passed on a policy
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
i don't i think we need to just leave it
 
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.670 align:start position:0%

no turcotte seconded it
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
and represented griffin made the motion
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
this bill would have the state pay
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
7.5 percent of the retirement system
 
00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.829 align:start position:0%
7.5 percent of the retirement system
contributions

00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
of its political subdivisions
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
for group one and group two employees
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
the bill came out of its policy
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
committee executive departments and
 
00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.309 align:start position:0%
committee executive departments and
administrations

00:44:58.309 --> 00:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
administrations
 
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
with an itl recommendation
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
and the full house
 
00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.030 align:start position:0%
and the full house
initially

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
initially
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
voted itl
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
it was later reconsidered at the end of
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
after many members had left
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
and it passed by the slimmest of margins
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
the finance committee opposes the bill
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
on multiple grounds
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
the bill would change the state's policy
 
00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:29.839 align:start position:0%
and the policy committee had rejected
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
that change
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
the cost of the bill is a function of
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
the number of employees
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
of the state's political subdivisions
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
and the state has no control
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
over that number
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
the bill's current estimated cost
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
is roughly 28 million
 
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
in both fiscal year
 
00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.589 align:start position:0%
in both fiscal year
2024

00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
and fiscal year
 
00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:58.150 align:start position:0%
and fiscal year
2025.

00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
2025.
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
that is budget money that the state may
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
not have at that time
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
but most importantly
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
with an effective date of july 31
 
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.109 align:start position:0%
with an effective date of july 31
2023

00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
passage of the bill would encumber a
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
future legislator's budget
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
which is never good policy
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
are there any further comments i'll rep
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
some leashman
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair and
 
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
certainly i think perhaps the members
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
that did vote on this later saw the
 
00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
error of their ways and that's why the
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
bill passed on the floor but
 
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.589 align:start position:0%
bill passed on the floor but
um

00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
as i think all of us know started in
 
00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.630 align:start position:0%
as i think all of us know started in
1966

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
1966
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
by providing 40 percent
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
of the contribution rate to
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities that helped offset that
 
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.030 align:start position:0%
municipalities that helped offset that
contribution

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
then in
 
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:56.680 align:start position:0%
77 we reduced it down to 35 percent
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
2009 we reduced it down to 30 percent
 
00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
with the hope at that time because i was
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
here that we would at least bring it
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
back when the state's coffers were a
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
little healthier than they were in 2009
 
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
however in
 
00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.349 align:start position:0%
however in
2011

00:47:11.349 --> 00:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
2011
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
the legislature reduced it entirely i
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
think the 7.5 percent is reasonable the
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
state as as we all know is at least the
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
coffers are full this time around and at
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
the very least i think we can make a
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
small contribution to help offset
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
municipal contributions to the
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
retirement system thanks
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further comments
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
when we reduced it to zero
 
00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
we increased the contributions by the
 
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.910 align:start position:0%
we increased the contributions by the
members

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
so that it
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
took away most of the cost of
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
what we had what we would have paid from
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
the important thing is here when we sit
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
down to make a budget we interview all
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
these departments and we put them under
 
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.430 align:start position:0%
these departments and we put them under
strict

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
strict
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
control to spend no more than what we
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
give them
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
that's impossible
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
if we're going to contribute to the
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
retirement systems of municipal and
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
county employees we have no control over
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
that piece
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
they could keep hiring people and hiring
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
people they could keep giving
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
increases in pay and each of those
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
actions would make this more expensive
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
to the state so going forward
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
looking at 27 months when we finish our
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
budget there's no prediction what this
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
could amount to it's a dangerous way
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
to do any kind of funding so that's why
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to have something
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
controllable when we decide we're going
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
to give the towns 100 million that's a
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
set amount when we decide we're going to
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
give the towns an increased portion of
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms that's a set amount it
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
won't go out unless we get it in so
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's no way that would unbalance the
 
00:48:56.549 --> 00:48:56.559 align:start position:0%
budget but this
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
if we get into the habit of paying for
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
retirement systems for
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
for non-state employees
 
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:03.990 align:start position:0%
for non-state employees
then

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
we could easily unbalance the budget so
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
i think we shouldn't do that we
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do any action that's going to
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
lead down that road thank you
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative waltz
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman i would suggest
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
that the argument that the towns are
 
00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
going to just hire and hire and then
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
have an imposition on the state is
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
nothing but a straw man the towns have
 
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:28.880 align:start position:0%
no motivation to hire because they have
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
to pay the salaries of those and those
 
00:49:33.030 --> 00:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
town budgets are tight one only has to
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
attend a regular be a regular attendee
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
of town meeting to know how hard it is
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
to get a new employee into a town budget
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
so i think that argument is nothing but
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
a straw man the real argument here is
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
the state when the state dropped this in
 
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
2009 there was a huge spike in property
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
taxes for the counts and to suggest that
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
it was made up for by the additional
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
employee compensator contributions is
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
just wrong
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
there was a huge increase in local
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
we have citizens throughout the state
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
who are suffering who are having to sell
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
their homes who are dealing with all
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
kinds of things because we have crammed
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
so much down on the towns that was once
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
paid for by the state we owe it to our
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
local communities to start returning
 
00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
some of the contribution that we should
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
be paying for the retirement systems
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
that we once paid and that we suddenly
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
pulled the rug out from under them
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
i think that we should be passing this
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
and that we should be sending money to
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
the towns and give us some property tax
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
relief to our citizens throughout the
 
00:50:31.359 --> 00:50:33.670 align:start position:0%
relief to our citizens throughout the
state

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.319 --> 00:50:37.670 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%

if i could madam chair please just a
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
brief background this bill uh came from
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
election law uh it also went through a
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
division vote on the floor of the house
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
it came out of division one here in
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
finance seven to zero
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
uh essentially what the bill will do is
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
allow the voter checklist to be
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
available in a spreadsheet form
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
at the request of a resident of a town
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
or city
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
once a month maximum
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
the fee structure that's currently in
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
statute for voter checklists remains in
 
00:54:29.359 --> 00:54:30.230 align:start position:0%
statute for voter checklists remains in
place

00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
so there is no financial
 
00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:34.230 align:start position:0%
so there is no financial
burden

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
burden
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
with regards to the passage of this bill
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
today now i'll have you know election
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
law amended the bill
 
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
and with that came an amended fiscal
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
note that was
 
00:54:50.549 --> 00:54:50.559 align:start position:0%
i just received myself yesterday
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
so i want to be sure
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
that you're aware that the original bill
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
as drafted
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
reflects a decrease of a hundred
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to the budget that is
 
00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.510 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to the budget that is
incorrect

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
because the bill has been amended from
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
election law
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
and you'll notice uh if
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
we have the new fiscal note
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
it says that there is no impact on the
 
00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.349 align:start position:0%
it says that there is no impact on the
state

00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:55:13.359 --> 00:55:14.470 align:start position:0%
state
funds

00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
so i want to make that very clear
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
the reason likely for that is because
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
originally when the bill was drafted
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
undetermined whether or not the
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
checklist in a spreadsheet form would be
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
a fee would be for a fee
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
and as it turns out in the amended
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
version and i've confirmed this with
 
00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
several sources yes the spreadsheet does
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
have the same fee structure that's in
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
the law now
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
so with that i would ask you all to
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
support my motion of ought to pass thank
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%

00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%

00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
if this came from the policy committee
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
otp and because of the amendment there
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
is no fiscal impact shouldn't we just
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
simply vote otp and put this on consent
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%

now it's added to the underlying bill
 
01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:07.190 align:start position:0%
now it's added to the underlying bill
which

01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%

72.2 million dollars
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
the likelihood of that going forward was
 
01:00:30.559 --> 01:00:32.630 align:start position:0%
the likelihood of that going forward was
non-existent

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%

01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
not exceeding not
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
but we also understand there's a dire
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
need for some sort of
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
recognition and contribution to the
 
01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.390 align:start position:0%
recognition and contribution to the
retirees

01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
retirees
 
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
that haven't received any form of cola
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%
since 2019 and that
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
was merely another 500
 
01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:59.829 align:start position:0%
was merely another 500
um

01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
one-time payment to all retirees again
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
put this amendment forward primarily
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there is a need
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
we're currently in in a high inflation
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
economy and um
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
i i believe many of the people that are
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
depending on their retirement
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
to sustain their way of living are
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
having an
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
incredibly hard time
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
also we heard a lot of and that's that's
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
the obvious for a cola and that's the
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
obvious for
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
helping out the retirees on the
 
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
retirement system but one thing that
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
also has occurred since there was a
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
decrease in the retirement
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.430 align:start position:0%
and um
departments

01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
departments
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
and we heard a lot of testimony to this
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
fact are having
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of trouble
 
01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.710 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of trouble
recruiting

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
recruiting
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
that they currently have in the driver
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
issue i believe is the retirement system
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
one of the motivation fact mode of
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
motivation factors for people to choose
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
a career with the state
 
01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.270 align:start position:0%
a career with the state
is

01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
they understand that their remuneration
 
01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
during their service is not as much as
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
it could be otherwise
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
but they also were attracted by the fact
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
that there's a
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
a good retirement system available to
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
them and it would be available to them
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
in in and
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
when they're still at a at a reasonably
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
young age those that
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
and that was one of the primary factors
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
in recruitment and retainment of
 
01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:46.950 align:start position:0%
in recruitment and retainment of
personnel

01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
since like i stated
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
there was a change in the retirement
 
01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:51.589 align:start position:0%
there was a change in the retirement
system

01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
people have flooded the doors leaving
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
the state service
 
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony currently for an
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
example in our prison system
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
the guards there serve a very important
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
function they're now dealing with a 60
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
percent shortfall of personnel
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
which which alone makes that a
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
undesirable and even a dangerous
 
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.510 align:start position:0%
undesirable and even a dangerous
circumstance

01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:15.430 align:start position:0%
circumstance
so

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
even though i would like to do more um
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
does give some recognition to their need
 
01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:25.039 align:start position:0%
but it's also we understand that this is
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
an issue that needs to be addressed and
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully sooner than later we can
 
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
put the appropriate funding behind the
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
retirement system thank you madam chair
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
and i urge you out to pass thank you are
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
there further comments representative
 
01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.710 align:start position:0%
there further comments representative
weiler

01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
i agree that if someone was living on
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
this only this pension
 
01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
that yes every little bit helps but in
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
the past
 
01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
when we gave
 
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh a
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
a cost of living increase or or a
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
stipend and just a single one-time
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
stipend we looked at the whole income
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
there could be somebody
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
making under 30 000 in
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
in the state retirement but they could
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
also have a military pension and the
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
social security added to that so i think
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the past we've used total income
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
rather than just the income that was
 
01:04:18.549 --> 01:04:18.559 align:start position:0%
coming from the retirement system and i
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
wonder why we didn't do it this time
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
represent waltz
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weiler it is my
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
understanding that group 2 employees are
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
not eligible for
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
social security and the fact that they
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
pay a windfall tax on their state
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits already because of
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
the nature of the benefits and the
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
nature of federal tax law
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
so i would suggest that
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
um for many of these people this is
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
their only source of income because they
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
are not eligible for social security
 
01:04:58.230 --> 01:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you that's irrelevant
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:05:02.789 --> 01:05:02.799 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um and this is
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
to representative hatch if i may i
 
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:06.829 align:start position:0%
to representative hatch if i may i
i

01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the fact that we have a
 
01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
problem we'd like to fix which is the
 
01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:13.990 align:start position:0%
problem we'd like to fix which is the
um

01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
decline in or the amount of attrition
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
that's taking place prior to retirement
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
i i just don't see the connection
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
between a one-time
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
500 payment and a long-term incentive to
 
01:05:26.319 --> 01:05:27.589 align:start position:0%
500 payment and a long-term incentive to
maintain

01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh employment
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
and and and it also makes me wonder
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh if we pay a one-time 500 dollar
 
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
payment aren't we really
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
signaling that they can expect more
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
one-time payments in the future i mean a
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
one-and-done doesn't seem like that
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
would hold up what what are your
 
01:05:47.589 --> 01:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that sir
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question uh just
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
a moment please sorry representative
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
hatch you may respond
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair we'll get there
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
i know
 
01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.309 align:start position:0%
i know
um

01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:02.309 --> 01:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
i i understand your comment but um
 
01:06:02.319 --> 01:06:03.430 align:start position:0%
i i understand your comment but um
a

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
the 500 one-time payment is in
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
recognition of the need and also we're
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
in hyperinflation and my thoughts to
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
that exactly my personal thoughts is
 
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe it would just help
 
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
some of those that are really really
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
struggling on their retirement from the
 
01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.349 align:start position:0%
struggling on their retirement from the
state

01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
it might allow them to buy a tank full
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
of fuel
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
it is just an immediate assistance to
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
the need that i'm sure many of them have
 
01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.069 align:start position:0%
the need that i'm sure many of them have
and

01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:35.910 --> 01:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
so the intent of this is not for
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
retainment when i was talking about that
 
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
i was just speaking to the retirement
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
system at all
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
taken away the attractiveness
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
of the state retirement system to many
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
many people who at one time
 
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
considered having a career with the
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
state but no longer do and and it's
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
really a serious problem
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
and the one that was spoken to the most
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
and passionately was the issue at our
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
prison system um we're creating some
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
dangerous circumstances with the lack of
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
personnel so we have to do something
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
to address that and i do know this been
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
here long enough that there was a strong
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
recruitment program there was a very
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
good retainment
 
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.029 align:start position:0%
good retainment
stat

01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
stat
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
mainly because of the retirement system
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
that was in place for those that are
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
serving us thank you
 
01:07:36.789 --> 01:07:36.799 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
burner yes i'm the prime sponsor of this
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
bill for a lot of the reasons that
 
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative hatch brought this up
 
01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
for clarification we did the one-time
 
01:07:46.799 --> 01:07:47.829 align:start position:0%
for clarification we did the one-time
payment

01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
payment
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago which was
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
unanimous in the house but we did that
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
with a fifty thousand dollar mark so
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
when i wrote when i submitted the bill i
 
01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
put it at thirty thousand dollars to try
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
to address the average person
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
under the thirty thousand are averaging
 
01:08:02.549 --> 01:08:02.559 align:start position:0%
around a nineteen thousand dollar
 
01:08:02.559 --> 01:08:03.510 align:start position:0%
around a nineteen thousand dollar
pension

01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
pension
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
and i was trying to get something like a
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
caller i know that's budget
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
but this isn't much as a budget buster
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
because the last one did have some
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
impact the last payment i know it had
 
01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
some impact and that's why i went with
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
the uh thirty thousand dollar level
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
so we didn't get the group two in and
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
all that so
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
just for clarification thank you
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there further
 
01:08:25.279 --> 01:08:27.590 align:start position:0%

if this move were to be made
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
fees would be
 
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.270 align:start position:0%
fees would be
involved

01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
with regards to licensing of assessors
 
01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.950 align:start position:0%
with regards to licensing of assessors
currently

01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
with the board under the dra there are
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
no fees
 
01:20:10.629 --> 01:20:10.639 align:start position:0%
it is fees that would fund this
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
board under the oplc
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
and with that i would
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
ask that the committee vote in favor of
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative leishman
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair i won't be supporting
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
this motion
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
there are several things that caught my
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
eye during the discussion one the dra
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
did not
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
ask for this change and in my belief the
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
dre has done a fairly
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
good job overseeing assessors
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
one of their responsibilities one of
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
many this creates a fine structure
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
without an appeals process
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
it also creates a fee
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
and i know my colleagues on the other
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
side of the aisle have never been really
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
in favor of fees but
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
i just think the way things have gone
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
for years with the dra and their
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
oversight of assessors in the process
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
has been done well so i will not be
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
supporting the motion madam chair
 
01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:12.149 align:start position:0%
supporting the motion madam chair
thanks

01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
just based on a thank you madam chair
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
just based on a conversation i had uh
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
recently with regards to the fee
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
structure which is certainly true um the
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
balance here is transparency and
 
01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.149 align:start position:0%
balance here is transparency and
government

01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:21:34.709 --> 01:21:34.719 align:start position:0%
and that was the the motive behind
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
offering the bill in the first place
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
and uh it seems that that transparency
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
what outweighed
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh the fee structure uh in the entire
 
01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
edna committee and the majority of our
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
division one thank you madam chair
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any for any further
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
comments madam
 
01:21:55.679 --> 01:21:57.110 align:start position:0%
comments madam
uh

01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:58.950 --> 01:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
i just have a question of division one
 
01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.470 align:start position:0%
i just have a question of division one
certainly

01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh did you hear from the assessors
 
01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:10.870 align:start position:0%
uh did you hear from the assessors
themselves

01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
the answer to your question is not as i
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
recall however
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
they did testify to edna
 
01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
i watched that hearing
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
and it was the board
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
the chair it was the vice chairman of
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
the board of assessors who testified
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
and uh was in favor of the bill
 
01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
in fact it was his testimony i found
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
quite critical in terms of the
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
background and the intent of the move
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative griffin
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
i believe this is a
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
solution looking for a problem
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
i think the board of excesses at the dra
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
has worked well
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
we know that the dra didn't have a
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
position on this
 
01:23:00.639 --> 01:23:02.310 align:start position:0%
position on this
and

01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
and i suspect that fees are going to go
 
01:23:06.550 --> 01:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
up and maybe
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
maybe other costs and
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
i tend to vote no
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other comments
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
versum hatch
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
i voted for this in division three
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
and and i have to admit i'm division one
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me i have to admit that i have
 
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.709 align:start position:0%
excuse me i have to admit that i have
since

01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh given a lot of thought and talked to
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
a few individuals concerning this and
 
01:23:36.550 --> 01:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
i'm and i'm thinking i may change my
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
vote um that i had in the division
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
primarily um
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
i supported this because a i have a lot
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
of confidence in the oplc and i still
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
carry that um but
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
when i
 
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
asked a few questions of the assessors i
 
01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:52.790 align:start position:0%
asked a few questions of the assessors i
knew

01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
knew
 
01:23:55.110 --> 01:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
and tried to weed out the necessity for
 
01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:55.830 align:start position:0%
and tried to weed out the necessity for
this

01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
and and i got the blank stare
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
they're not not aware and and i i think
 
01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
the statement that maybe this is a
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
solution looking for a problem um
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:15.430 --> 01:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know of any cases that i've
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
heard up and that's what i asked a few
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
assessors where if there was an issue
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
with whatever they did
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
the person that had issue with it have
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
why they did what they did in other
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
words they they were open to any
 
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
questions and any documentation they had
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
is open to the public so um
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
and as far as a fee goes
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
the only stop check for this this that
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
has changed in this legislature uh in
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
the last few terms
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
now they would go to a
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
rules gel card
 
01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.229 align:start position:0%
rules gel card
and

01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
it was there where the fee would be
 
01:24:58.159 --> 01:24:59.189 align:start position:0%
it was there where the fee would be
reviewed

01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
um having chaired gel cart and have been
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
have having been a member of that for
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
many years um we really don't have the
 
01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.149 align:start position:0%
many years um we really don't have the
time

01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
or even the wherewithal
 
01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:10.790 align:start position:0%
or even the wherewithal
um

01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
to do a complete
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
investigation of the fees the fee
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
structures um as we did in ways and
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
means though though we try and i'm not
 
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
saying gel car doesn't do its job but
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
there's not the time
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
or the staff
 
01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:28.719 align:start position:0%
or the ability to pay the very close
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
scrutiny to fees
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
that has been done in ways and means so
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
um i apologize for this but i i need to
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
change my vote and i no longer support
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
this change without some further
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
thought and investigation thank you
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh thank you for being on
 
01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:50.950 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh thank you for being on
gelcar

01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
brutal

01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
brutal
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i think
 
01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's worse than appendicitis there's no
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
question in my mind or having a tooth
 
01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.350 align:start position:0%
question in my mind or having a tooth
bolt

01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
bolt
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that madam chair
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
representatives yes
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman to answer
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative walder's question the
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
answer is no
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
being the clerk for division one
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
i wish that somebody from the board of
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
associates would have been present
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
because i had some questions during and
 
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
even after
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know our hearing so
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
i was a little bit disappointed that
 
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
nobody seemed to care or take interest
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
in the bill thank you
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
are there further comments or questions
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh thank you
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair i
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
i think i'm gonna vote no on this and
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
i'll accept that there is a problem that
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
we found and the found problem is
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh a perception that there's a lack of
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
transparency i just would like to see
 
01:26:55.110 --> 01:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
that addressed rather than
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
moving the assessors over into an
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
environment in which a fee structure is
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
going to be added to them and given that
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
so many of these are employed by city
 
01:27:06.709 --> 01:27:06.719 align:start position:0%
and state
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
these would become reimbursable expenses
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
the fees so i you know in this era of
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
trying to reduce pressure on property
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
taxes this would just be another burden
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
to push downhill so i think i'll be
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
voting now
 
01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
represent mooney in a last attempt here
 
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1552 to
 
01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
preserve the unanimous
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh decision of the edna committee to
 
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
make this happen having done their their
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
research i would just add that by moving
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
the board to the oplc
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
it would then be comparable to the way
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
other boards are
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
managed and the way that they conduct
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%

i mean it's still like 36 percent at the
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
men's prison but it's not 60 percent

document and let people read
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh what the amendment does the original
 
01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.070 align:start position:0%
uh what the amendment does the original
bill

01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:36:08.070 --> 01:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh was for group two
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
and the calculation of uh retirement
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
that was changed in
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
in 2011.
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh what the amendment does
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
and that well the basic bill
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
had a lot more information and it
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
changed a lot more things the amendment
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
addresses this calculation for group two
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
there are approximately 4 900 employees
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
in group 2.
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
this addresses the 1900 that were
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
affected by the calculation change as of
 
01:36:37.679 --> 01:36:38.470 align:start position:0%
affected by the calculation change as of
july

01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
july
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
1st 2011
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
what this does is
 
01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.830 align:start position:0%
what this does is
restore

01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
restore
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
the calculation that those individuals
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
were hired under
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
anybody hired after that date
 
01:36:53.669 --> 01:36:53.679 align:start position:0%
has the current calculations what this
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
does is is
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
i would say repair
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
what was a bad a good bad idea in 2011
 
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
that got us to this point so what we're
 
01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
trying to do is make whole the
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
calculation for those employees that
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
were hired under a different calculation
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
set that got modified
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
so that's what basically the amendment
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
does is it narrows the scope from the
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
this does not have a fiscal note
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh it will have a fiscal note when it is
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
provided the other body because uh
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
retirement system actuarials uh only
 
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
provide fiscal notes on bills they don't
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
do it just on request
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
so this bill by the time it is is taken
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
up by the other body will have a fiscal
 
01:37:43.510 --> 01:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
note the estimate of cost is somewhere
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
in the 28 to 30 million dollar range
 
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
but that's that's a that's a scientific
 
01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.629 align:start position:0%
but that's that's a that's a scientific
guess

01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
guess
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you manager are you sure that's
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
not a swag it was a swag but i thought
 
01:37:55.830 --> 01:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'd delete some of the words thank you
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other comments
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
on the amendment uh representative waltz
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i agree with
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
what uh chairman emmerich said but i
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify a little it
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't quite restore things back to the
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
way it was in 2000
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
before we messed with it in 2011
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
then it was the top three years this is
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
now the top five years so it's it's
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
still a bit of a differentiation but
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
it's closer to what we did but i wanted
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that it's not a full
 
01:38:33.430 --> 01:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
clawback to what the law was before they
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
messed the legislature messed with it in
 
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
2011. it it gets us part of the way
 
01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
there but not all the way there
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further comments
 
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh i would concur
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
this is primary addressing the
 
01:38:47.679 --> 01:38:51.830 align:start position:0%
this is primary addressing the
calculation

01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:53.590 --> 01:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
represent edwards
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm just curious because i didn't sit
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
in on these meetings if if we have two
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
people who retired and two or were in
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
the system prior to 2011
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
and person a retires in 2019 person b
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
retires in 2024
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
does person a who retired in 2019 do
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
they see any change to their retirement
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
as a result of this bill
 
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
in the 2024 retiree
 
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
does does this essentially make that
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
person whole all the way back to 2011
 
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
with the distinction between the three
 
01:39:33.109 --> 01:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
and five-year mark
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding of this bill addresses
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
people who are currently employed
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't believe this has
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
anything to do with people who had re
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
some of some of us were here during that
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh sb3 discussion
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:00.639 align:start position:0%
for the people that were on the rolls
 
01:40:04.149 --> 01:40:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
those are the people
 
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
when they were they were on the rolls
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
but not vested
 
01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
and so when they came on
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
they were
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
under the assumption
 
01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:18.550 align:start position:0%
under the assumption
that

01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
the retirement system
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
what they thought when they came to work
 
01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:27.430 align:start position:0%
what they thought when they came to work
here

01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:28.470 align:start position:0%
here
and

01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:31.830 --> 01:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
the way the sb3 was written
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
you had to be vested
 
01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain
 
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:38.790 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain
your

01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
retirement the way the way it was
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
and so what this does is it
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
takes care of the people
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
that were on board
 
01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.629 align:start position:0%
that were on board
hired

01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
hired
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
but not vested
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
and so that's
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
i think that it has nothing to do with
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
when you retire
 
01:41:04.950 --> 01:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
it all has to do with when you were
 
01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:07.990 align:start position:0%
it all has to do with when you were
hired

01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
there any further comments
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
i have a question if it's possible is
 
01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
there a revised fiscal note that goes
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
with this the original fiscal note as
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
i'm reading it indicates a 50 roughly 56
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
million dollar cost in fy 23 is that
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
unchanged higher or lower
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%

million dollar range
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%

would you like to speak to your motion
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
yes very briefly um under current law
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
a motorcycle
 
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:31.600 align:start position:0%

why this would be a good idea
um

01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
um

audience
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
as the bill first was introduced uh we
 
01:51:00.719 --> 01:51:02.070 align:start position:0%
as the bill first was introduced uh we
tried

01:51:02.070 --> 01:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
tried
 
01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:03.510 align:start position:0%
tried
almost

01:51:03.510 --> 01:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
almost
 
01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
a little bit too prematurely to set
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
or standards for pollution in soil as a
 
01:51:12.149 --> 01:51:12.159 align:start position:0%
result of pfas
 
01:51:14.070 --> 01:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
as it turns out
 
01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
there is a federal study that's going to
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
be conducted on soil
 
01:51:21.270 --> 01:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
conducted by the united states
 
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
geological survey the usgs
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
that study is critical to the setting of
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
standards of pollution pfas pollution in
 
01:51:31.679 --> 01:51:33.510 align:start position:0%
standards of pollution pfas pollution in
soils

01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
soils
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
this amended bill
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
and i might add is amended entirely
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
different from the way it was originally
 
01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.390 align:start position:0%
different from the way it was originally
introduced

01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
the amended version recognizes that
 
01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:46.629 align:start position:0%
the amended version recognizes that
study

01:51:46.629 --> 01:51:46.639 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
recognizes the due date of that study
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
basically uh says that the commissioner
 
01:51:57.589 --> 01:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
would then set standards based on the
 
01:51:57.599 --> 01:51:58.790 align:start position:0%
would then set standards based on the
study

01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
these are critical
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
pieces also in section two of the
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
amended version of the bill
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
it amends the groundwater protection act
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
to add soil
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
and that a person liable for such
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
contamination provide safe alternative
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
water to an impacted well owner
 
01:52:21.669 --> 01:52:21.679 align:start position:0%
the word person i might add
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
includes corporations
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
public or private and companies
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
lastly the amended bill clarifies
 
01:52:32.709 --> 01:52:32.719 align:start position:0%
language with regards to certain
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste generators
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
making our state standards consistent
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
with those on the federal standard which
 
01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
i understand has been causing some
 
01:52:44.709 --> 01:52:44.719 align:start position:0%
confusion this bill will clear that up
 
01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
so the amended bill that came out of the
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
ena committee unanimously and then on
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar has a fiscal note
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
of no fiscal impact on the state
 
01:52:59.350 --> 01:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
and i'll hope that was brief enough and
 
01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate your support of an
 
01:53:03.430 --> 01:53:03.440 align:start position:0%

simply discussing what uh what this does
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely madam chair actually just a
 
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
couple of very small amendments
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
um the original the original bill didn't
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
specify how much money could be devoted
 
01:56:28.229 --> 01:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
to any one particular program uh so we
 
01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
added in a
 
01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of any grant shall be no more
 
01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
than 4 000 per program and that gives
 
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
the department still a lot of latitude
 
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
on exactly how much they give to
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
each program if they get a uh you know a
 
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
lot of requests
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
they can reduce that number
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh but in no case can they
 
01:56:50.790 --> 01:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
do more than four thousand uh the only
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
other part of the amendment was the
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%

01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%

02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
first the amendment

reduces the amount of the allocation for
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%

and secondly
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does uh this was
 
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
actually um a non-germane
 
02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:45.189 align:start position:0%
actually um a non-germane
amendment

02:03:45.189 --> 02:03:45.199 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
that uh came before us at a public
 
02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:48.709 align:start position:0%
that uh came before us at a public
hearing

02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:48.719 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:03:48.719 --> 02:03:50.069 align:start position:0%
hearing
recently

02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
recently
 
02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
amendment a portion of the amendment
 
02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
is to a pr um
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
authorize the department of education to

apply to be part of a pilot program for
 
02:04:10.229 --> 02:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
medicaid direct certification programs
 
02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
this original thinking came out of a
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
committee that was a
 
02:04:18.870 --> 02:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
committee that came out of division two
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
and house education it was a combined
 
02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:22.069 align:start position:0%
and house education it was a combined
committee

02:04:22.069 --> 02:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
that we were looking at different um we
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
were concerned about the manner in which
 
02:04:31.589 --> 02:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch counts were taken
 
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
and this was a result this came as a
 
02:04:37.910 --> 02:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation and a result of that
 
02:04:40.069 --> 02:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
committee that worked
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:42.310 align:start position:0%
on this
group

02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
group
 
02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:43.270 align:start position:0%
group

02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
what it does is the
 
02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560 align:start position:0%

potential monetary uh
 
02:05:33.270 --> 02:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
factor involved
 
02:05:35.910 --> 02:05:35.920 align:start position:0%

02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%

02:05:43.430 --> 02:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:45.030 --> 02:05:45.040 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
the cost that would be associated this
 
02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:54.709 align:start position:0%
the cost that would be associated this
um

02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:54.719 --> 02:05:55.750 align:start position:0%
um
i

02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:05:55.760 --> 02:05:56.870 align:start position:0%
i
actually

02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
did it's a pilot program
 
02:05:59.119 --> 02:06:00.229 align:start position:0%
did it's a pilot program
and

02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
02:06:01.679 --> 02:06:03.189 align:start position:0%
i think the
ultimate

02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
ultimate
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
would be a benefit
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
to the children of new hampshire
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
in that we will better identify the
 
02:06:12.629 --> 02:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
number of students who will be eligible
 
02:06:15.189 --> 02:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced lunch and i think
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
we all know that that children

in school and in terms of school
 
02:06:33.669 --> 02:06:33.679 align:start position:0%
districts this will really be a plus for
 
02:06:35.109 --> 02:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
them because we will reduce the
 
02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
paperwork that they need to um uh

gather on a yearly basis

states participating in this process and
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
as the research has shown significant
 
02:06:53.350 --> 02:06:53.360 align:start position:0%

madam chair this is a non-german
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
amendment that came to us to address an
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
emergency situation regarding the stores
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
street parking garage
 
02:12:13.589 --> 02:12:13.599 align:start position:0%
it's well past its lifespan
 
02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's been discussed for years whether or
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
not what we need to do with the store
 
02:12:21.030 --> 02:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
street garage
 
02:12:22.629 --> 02:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
it would appear that
 
02:12:24.709 --> 02:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
minor injuries
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
to individuals using that garage have
 
02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
been growing in frequency over the past
 
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
couple of years trippings and scrapes
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
and bruises and bumps
 
02:12:35.189 --> 02:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
i took special note driving in today to
 
02:12:37.109 --> 02:12:37.119 align:start position:0%
look at the netting and netting to me
 
02:12:38.709 --> 02:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
seems to be kind of a euphemism this is
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
like really hard stuff
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
to keep chunks of the stores street
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
garage from falling onto the first floor
 
02:12:47.830 --> 02:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
platform or falling onto a car or a
 
02:12:50.069 --> 02:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
person walking on that platform also
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
from chunks falling onto the road below
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
so this came to us as an emergency
 
02:12:57.430 --> 02:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
situation that we
 
02:12:59.109 --> 02:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
need to deal with instead of kicking it
 
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
down the road which apparently we have
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
been doing for a while um
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:13:07.109 --> 02:13:07.119 align:start position:0%
request or suggests that it does more
 
02:13:09.589 --> 02:13:09.599 align:start position:0%
than suggest asks that the store street
 
02:13:09.599 --> 02:13:10.629 align:start position:0%
than suggest asks that the store street
garage

02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
garage
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
be demolished
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
a new structure be constructed at the
 
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
site of the current department of
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
justice building which would also be
 
02:13:19.199 --> 02:13:20.149 align:start position:0%
justice building which would also be
raised

02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
raised
 
02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
and that the department of justice be
 
02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
moved to another location
 
02:13:25.750 --> 02:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
and there is a place where they can go
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
they've already considered where they
 
02:13:29.830 --> 02:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
would put justice
 
02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
given that this has been a problem for a
 
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
long time the building
 
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
we are spending apparently several
 
02:13:39.430 --> 02:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year to keep it at
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
least functional um perhaps
 
02:13:44.550 --> 02:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
your version of safe is not necessarily
 
02:13:46.069 --> 02:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
the same as other people's version of
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
safe but we are sure that it is safe
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
right now but it is costing a
 
02:13:51.750 --> 02:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money every year
 
02:13:54.069 --> 02:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain that position
 
02:13:56.470 --> 02:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
so this amendment came to us to make the
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
request as an appropriation of 35
 
02:14:01.030 --> 02:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars i know it always stings
 
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
to spend money like that especially when
 
02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
there are needs around the state but in
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
this instance the government needs has a
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
strong need too
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
so i request your support
 
02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
on this amendment to address the store
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
street garage by removing that garage
 
02:14:17.430 --> 02:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
removing the building um that is located
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
at the department of justice building a
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
new structure there and uh relocating
 
02:14:23.589 --> 02:14:23.599 align:start position:0%
the department of justice with regards
 
02:14:26.310 --> 02:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
to specifications um that is down in the
 
02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
future so i cannot speak to exactly at
 
02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
all what this would look like but i
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
please ask your support for this
 
02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
amendment it is something we need to do
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
now we have reached the point of an
 
02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:37.189 align:start position:0%
now we have reached the point of an
emergency

02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other comments
 
02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:40.390 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other comments
questions

02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:14:42.310 --> 02:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh thank you
 
02:14:45.510 --> 02:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair and and thank you um
 
02:14:48.069 --> 02:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
i i can imagine it's a it's a crisis and
 
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
we have to act now i would just like to
 
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
ask um
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
did the capital budget process break
 
02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:57.599 align:start position:0%
because we didn't catch this earlier in
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
a capital budgeting process and if so
 
02:15:03.589 --> 02:15:03.599 align:start position:0%
how did that process break down
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:15:08.310 --> 02:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know um if this can be laid to
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
the capital budget process or not
 
02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
i think that it's simply it's risen to
 
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
the level of an emergency and putting it
 
02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
through the capital budget process at
 
02:15:19.109 --> 02:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
this point would not be appropriate i
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
can't speak to why we did not do this
 
02:15:25.270 --> 02:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
10-15 years ago so
 
02:15:25.280 --> 02:15:26.069 align:start position:0%
10-15 years ago so
okay

02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay so my follow-up on that isn't that
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
i'm i have no argument that it's a
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
crisis and we have to do this now i'm
 
02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
just asking you know given that this is
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
such a
 
02:15:38.709 --> 02:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
obvious item that should be in the
 
02:15:41.669 --> 02:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
capital budget do we know why it wasn't
 
02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
included in the capital budget process
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
and i think i heard your answer to be no
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
02:15:49.589 --> 02:15:49.599 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler can shed some
 
02:15:51.990 --> 02:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
light on this
 
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes the uh chairman of public works got
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
up to say
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
that there's about a hundred million in
 
02:15:59.669 --> 02:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
the capital
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh budget every year and this would
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
would just kill all her other so many
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
other projects that he didn't think it
 
02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
was appropriate to put it in the capital
 
02:16:11.669 --> 02:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
budget because it would
 
02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
kind of reduce all her other work so
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
he's hoping that there's enough money
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
and surplus that we can do it out of
 
02:16:20.470 --> 02:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
that so we don't have to get involved in
 
02:16:21.910 --> 02:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
the capital budget that was his
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:25.910 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
uh

02:16:25.910 --> 02:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that
 
02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:30.229 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that
until

02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
relatively recently like this year
 
02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:34.629 align:start position:0%
relatively recently like this year
or

02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
a year ago whatever but relatively
 
02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:37.910 align:start position:0%
a year ago whatever but relatively
recently

02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
recently
 
02:16:40.389 --> 02:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
is the first time that anyone has
 
02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
actually put anything together
 
02:16:46.629 --> 02:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
as to the cost of
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
uh replacing the store street garage
 
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
we've talked about it for
 
02:16:53.589 --> 02:16:53.599 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
02:16:53.599 --> 02:16:55.190 align:start position:0%
10 years
minimum

02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
02:16:58.389 --> 02:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
i was on a committee in 2005 to build a
 
02:17:00.629 --> 02:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
parking garage right there so that's
 
02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
more than 10 years
 
02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
so it just never really
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
got off the ground
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
in the past to where it could even be
 
02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:11.110 align:start position:0%
in the past to where it could even be
considered

02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
considered
 
02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:12.070 align:start position:0%
considered
by

02:17:12.070 --> 02:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:13.750 align:start position:0%
by
um

02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:15.429 --> 02:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
and i think that ken's point or sorry
 
02:17:22.629 --> 02:17:22.639 align:start position:0%
representative weiler's point about
 
02:17:22.639 --> 02:17:23.589 align:start position:0%
representative weiler's point about
uh

02:17:23.589 --> 02:17:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
trying to um
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
bond this through the capital budget
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
would really
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
be a significant problem for
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
the rest of the needs of the state so
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
did you have a further question
 
02:17:40.070 --> 02:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
i i did i i think the only reason i'm
 
02:17:42.469 --> 02:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
going to vote no on this obvious need is
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
that i it just feels to me like the
 
02:17:48.150 --> 02:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
capital budgeting process ought to have
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
routine replacement of buildings
 
02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
included and if we don't have enough
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
money in it then we should be
 
02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
showing an unfunded uh
 
02:17:59.669 --> 02:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
balance in the capital budget
 
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
requirements so i i just i'm going to
 
02:18:03.990 --> 02:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
vote no just because i think this was a
 
02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
broken process and even though i know we
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
need to do it
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:18:14.070 --> 02:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments
 
02:18:15.349 --> 02:18:15.359 align:start position:0%

this bill is a terror well it's not a
 
02:22:55.349 --> 02:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
a good bill
 
02:22:55.359 --> 02:22:56.070 align:start position:0%
a good bill
but

02:22:56.070 --> 02:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
what it means um during our hearing
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is really about um a
 
02:23:07.349 --> 02:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
natural disaster occurring in a town and
 
02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
what happens after that disaster takes
 
02:23:09.920 --> 02:23:11.030 align:start position:0%
what happens after that disaster takes
place

02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:23:13.190 --> 02:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
um and the question i asked i said you
 
02:23:16.150 --> 02:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
know god forbid if for some reason a
 
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
hurricane or a tornado went through my
 
02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
city of manchester what resources would
 
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
be immediately available to that my town
 
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:23:30.710 --> 02:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
right away there isn't anything we we do
 
02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:31.990 align:start position:0%
right away there isn't anything we we do
have

02:23:31.990 --> 02:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:23:34.070 --> 02:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
a piece of legislation
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
chapter 9 um under um
 
02:23:41.110 --> 02:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
9 colon 13-d
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
that is civil emergency and it it
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
provides the governor
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
with the authority to go to fiscal
 
02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
committee but you know and i know how
 
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
long it takes to get the fiscal
 
02:23:52.950 --> 02:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
committee that would be at least a two
 
02:23:55.349 --> 02:23:55.359 align:start position:0%
week turnaround so
 
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
in the event of all said what happened
 
02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
was the the
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
damage was so severe that the roads were
 
02:24:05.190 --> 02:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
closed um they they needed to repair the
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
bridge and the road and they needed to
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
get it opened right away and for that
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
they there was nothing available to them
 
02:24:16.230 --> 02:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
now while this bill was not a good bill
 
02:24:17.910 --> 02:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
i thought that
 
02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
probably maybe entertaining some kind of
 
02:24:23.990 --> 02:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
a conversation about what help is
 
02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.270 align:start position:0%
a conversation about what help is
available

02:24:25.270 --> 02:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
and to set up a meeting or a study group
 
02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:29.910 align:start position:0%
and to set up a meeting or a study group
with

02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:24:33.110 --> 02:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
homeland security about what could we do
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire to make
 
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
sure that we don't leave
 
02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
our towns and municipalities
 
02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
that especially the small small ones
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
that are the most vulnerable and don't
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
have much money immediately to make some

um
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that we probably have had
 
02:32:41.190 --> 02:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
some kind of a law enforcement conduct
 
02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:42.150 align:start position:0%
some kind of a law enforcement conduct
review

02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
review
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
process in the past is is this
 
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
is this a brand new thing we're doing or
 
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
or or is this augmenting something that
 
02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
we think could work better
 
02:32:54.309 --> 02:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
well there
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's more than augmenting i mean there
 
02:32:59.750 --> 02:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
there has been a a law enforcement
 
02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
you know misconduct uh process of
 
02:33:04.630 --> 02:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
investigation it's been
 
02:33:06.389 --> 02:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
i think our our understanding is it's
 
02:33:09.030 --> 02:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
been in the past not very
 
02:33:10.870 --> 02:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
standardized so there's much there's
 
02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
been much
 
02:33:14.710 --> 02:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
discrepancies between departments
 
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of how it's handled
 
02:33:16.720 --> 02:33:17.830 align:start position:0%
in terms of how it's handled
um

02:33:17.830 --> 02:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:19.110 align:start position:0%
um
uh

02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:33:21.270 --> 02:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
and and in terms of what i mean for
 
02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
example one of the things that this bill
 
02:33:25.030 --> 02:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
does is i think is very important is
 
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
define what constitutes police
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
misconduct um the the information we
 
02:33:32.710 --> 02:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
received was that you know various
 
02:33:35.190 --> 02:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
police departments in various places in
 
02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
the state have interpreted what kind
 
02:33:40.309 --> 02:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
what may constitute misconduct
 
02:33:41.910 --> 02:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
significantly differently among each
 
02:33:43.830 --> 02:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
other so i think that's one of the big
 
02:33:45.670 --> 02:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
things that this does
 
02:33:47.270 --> 02:33:47.280 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
02:54:22.870 --> 02:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
walner's at the top of that one
 
02:54:25.990 --> 02:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
so as you heard this program
 
02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
did not um end up getting into the
 
02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:30.309 align:start position:0%
did not um end up getting into the
budget

02:54:30.309 --> 02:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:54:34.389 --> 02:54:34.399 align:start position:0%
and um it seems like it was
 
02:54:36.710 --> 02:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
sort of an oversight or something happen
 
02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
these these folks have not had
 
02:54:42.150 --> 02:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
an increase in their
 
02:54:45.349 --> 02:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
eligibility for i believe we were told
 
02:54:47.429 --> 02:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
30 years
 
02:54:47.439 --> 02:54:48.469 align:start position:0%
30 years
and

02:54:48.469 --> 02:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:51.429 --> 02:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
these are very very low income people
 
02:54:53.670 --> 02:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
who go in and out of
 
02:54:53.680 --> 02:54:55.269 align:start position:0%
who go in and out of
medicaid

02:54:55.269 --> 02:54:55.279 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:54:57.510 --> 02:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
and getting medical assistance with
 
02:54:57.520 --> 02:54:58.389 align:start position:0%
and getting medical assistance with
their

02:54:58.389 --> 02:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:55:00.870 --> 02:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
bills many of them are people with
 
02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
mental illness
 
02:55:04.550 --> 02:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
and they need
 
02:55:09.190 --> 02:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:11.030 --> 02:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
what my amendment does is fund it for
 
02:55:12.550 --> 02:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
six months
 
02:55:15.110 --> 02:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative edwards did it for three
 
02:55:17.110 --> 02:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
i just feel like they have been left
 
02:55:19.429 --> 02:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
behind for so long
 
02:55:22.309 --> 02:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
and they got inadvertently left out of
 
02:55:24.710 --> 02:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
the budget um
 
02:55:27.349 --> 02:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
during this last budget period so
 
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
it was sort of a middle ground
 
02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative walner um i
 
02:55:37.670 --> 02:55:37.680 align:start position:0%

02:55:41.429 --> 02:55:41.439 align:start position:0%

02:55:46.630 --> 02:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
you all right um is there anyone else
 
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
that wants to speak to this
 
02:55:50.550 --> 02:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
02:55:53.269 --> 02:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you madam chair um
 
02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
i i
 
02:55:57.429 --> 02:55:57.439 align:start position:0%
i don't have any opposition to this the
 
02:56:00.469 --> 02:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh the my amendment came first in the
 
02:56:02.150 --> 02:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
process and and in talking to
 
02:56:04.070 --> 02:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative walner i i believe that
 
02:56:05.670 --> 02:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
triggered her thinking that she would
 
02:56:07.429 --> 02:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
submit this one
 
02:56:07.439 --> 02:56:08.389 align:start position:0%
submit this one
um

02:56:08.389 --> 02:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:08.399 --> 02:56:09.269 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:56:09.269 --> 02:56:09.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:11.510 --> 02:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
the reason i picked a quarter
 
02:56:14.550 --> 02:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
was predominantly out of a perception
 
02:56:17.110 --> 02:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
that we had a limited amount of money to
 
02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:18.230 align:start position:0%
that we had a limited amount of money to
apply

02:56:18.230 --> 02:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
apply
 
02:56:20.630 --> 02:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
in this cycle and i didn't know how much
 
02:56:23.590 --> 02:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
it was and so i figured a quarter was a
 
02:56:25.830 --> 02:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
parsimonious way to get something and
 
02:56:27.590 --> 02:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
not just nothing so
 
02:56:30.710 --> 02:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
um so i i'm not opposed to the walnur
 
02:56:30.720 --> 02:56:33.190 align:start position:0%
um so i i'm not opposed to the walnur

representative griffin
 
02:58:36.309 --> 02:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair my question is
 
02:58:38.389 --> 02:58:38.399 align:start position:0%
does that wipe out the earlier amendment
 
02:58:40.230 --> 02:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
well that's just what i was trying to
 
02:58:42.309 --> 02:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
figure out but i think it does but i
 
02:58:44.630 --> 02:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
think we have to eliminate the other
 
02:58:44.640 --> 02:58:45.750 align:start position:0%
think we have to eliminate the other
amendment

02:58:45.750 --> 02:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:58:49.910 --> 02:58:49.920 align:start position:0%

amendment 1181
 
02:58:54.630 --> 02:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
and and then that if we voted on that
 
02:58:58.830 --> 02:58:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:58.840 --> 02:59:00.550 align:start position:0%

02:59:19.190 --> 02:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:20.710 --> 02:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
as amended
 
02:59:27.269 --> 02:59:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:27.279 --> 02:59:35.670 align:start position:0%
 
eight 2022-1181

02:59:35.670 --> 02:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:37.590 --> 02:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
yes you may
 
02:59:40.150 --> 02:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
oh okay so i think this is uh fairly
 
02:59:42.389 --> 02:59:42.399 align:start position:0%
obvious i we just we just passed one
 
02:59:44.790 --> 02:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
that lasts a longer period of time with
 
02:59:46.309 --> 02:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
the walnut amendment
 
02:59:49.510 --> 02:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
and uh this is a population of need i'd
 
02:59:51.429 --> 02:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
also add that we get federal matching
 
02:59:53.190 --> 02:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
money as a result of this
 
02:59:58.230 --> 02:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
so um i i i'm in favor of 1181
 
03:00:00.870 --> 03:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
and and not the uh earlier one i i
 
03:00:04.230 --> 03:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
proposed okay thank you very much
 
03:00:06.150 --> 03:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
represent lynn yes just really a
 
03:00:07.750 --> 03:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
question for representative which can
 
03:00:09.429 --> 03:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
you or or representative walnut can you
 
03:00:12.230 --> 03:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
just sort of explain to me or a little
 
03:00:15.349 --> 03:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
more detail what the in and out program
 
03:00:16.790 --> 03:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
really is how
 
03:00:19.750 --> 03:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
how it works and who it captures uh
 
03:00:23.429 --> 03:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:26.150 --> 03:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
we were given the information that there
 
03:00:29.030 --> 03:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
are right now about 2500
 
03:00:29.040 --> 03:00:30.150 align:start position:0%
are right now about 2500
um

03:00:30.150 --> 03:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:32.389 --> 03:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
people with mental illness that are on
 
03:00:33.670 --> 03:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
this program
 
03:00:35.309 --> 03:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
and about
 
03:00:39.030 --> 03:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
3600 that fall into the area of
 
03:00:41.910 --> 03:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
elderly disabled or blind
 
03:00:44.150 --> 03:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
they're low-income people who whose
 
03:00:46.630 --> 03:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
incomes are not
 
03:00:50.710 --> 03:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
not low enough to be on state assistance
 
03:00:53.830 --> 03:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
but they have such a large spin down
 
03:00:53.840 --> 03:00:54.790 align:start position:0%
but they have such a large spin down
for

03:00:54.790 --> 03:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:00:54.800 --> 03:00:55.910 align:start position:0%
for
health

03:00:55.910 --> 03:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
health
 
03:00:57.670 --> 03:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
related costs
 
03:01:01.429 --> 03:01:01.439 align:start position:0%
that their that their incomes drop
 
03:01:04.070 --> 03:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
way below what they're uh way below the
 
03:01:06.550 --> 03:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
eligibility for state assistance
 
03:01:09.190 --> 03:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
so it's a monthly program so when on
 
03:01:12.950 --> 03:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
months that they have a lot of expenses
 
03:01:14.309 --> 03:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
they can get
 
03:01:14.319 --> 03:01:15.190 align:start position:0%
they can get
some

03:01:15.190 --> 03:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:01:17.349 --> 03:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
medical help on months that they don't
 
03:01:18.790 --> 03:01:18.800 align:start position:0%
they have to cover
 
03:01:20.950 --> 03:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
all of their own cost
 
03:01:22.230 --> 03:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
03:01:24.950 --> 03:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
far from an expert in it and i hope i've
 
03:01:27.030 --> 03:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
not messed this up okay
 
03:01:29.349 --> 03:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
but that's my understanding of how it
 
03:01:30.870 --> 03:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
works um
 
03:01:33.349 --> 03:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
but these are very very meaty
 
03:01:35.190 --> 03:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
meaty um
 
03:01:39.910 --> 03:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:42.870 --> 03:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards thank you i i
 
03:01:45.190 --> 03:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
i concur with what representative walner
 
03:01:48.309 --> 03:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
just said and i i would just add that
 
03:01:51.030 --> 03:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the folks that benefit most from
 
03:01:53.670 --> 03:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
this are in chronic care conditions
 
03:01:55.750 --> 03:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
because they end up
 
03:01:57.510 --> 03:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
due to their medical spend dropping
 
03:01:59.830 --> 03:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
below the eligibility levels uh
 
03:02:03.030 --> 03:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
frequently within a year so uh this this
 
03:02:05.349 --> 03:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
helps people these help our poorest
 
03:02:08.710 --> 03:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:10.790 --> 03:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you both
 
03:02:13.750 --> 03:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify a little bit further
 
03:02:17.750 --> 03:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
this is each month so their income is is
 
03:02:19.750 --> 03:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
above the medicaid level they start
 
03:02:21.510 --> 03:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
buying their drugs they hit the medicaid
 
03:02:23.349 --> 03:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
and they pay the money they get down to
 
03:02:25.349 --> 03:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
the medicaid level now medicaid picks it
 
03:02:27.910 --> 03:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
up next month process starts over again
 
03:02:29.429 --> 03:02:29.439 align:start position:0%
they start having to spend their money
 
03:02:31.190 --> 03:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
they hit the medicaid level medicaid
 
03:02:33.030 --> 03:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
picks up so a month-to-month basis
 
03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
they're basically spending money out of
 
03:02:36.150 --> 03:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
pocket and then medicaid picks up a
 
03:02:37.910 --> 03:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
little bit and then it starts over again
 
03:02:39.349 --> 03:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
the next month so the right on the
 
03:02:41.349 --> 03:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
border line of the medicaid
 
03:02:41.359 --> 03:02:43.830 align:start position:0%
border line of the medicaid
threshold

03:02:43.830 --> 03:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
03:02:45.429 --> 03:02:45.439 align:start position:0%
you know i'm can i ask just one
 
03:02:47.110 --> 03:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up so am i understanding what
 
03:02:48.790 --> 03:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
you're saying that that the money that
 
03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:49.590 align:start position:0%
you're saying that that the money that
we're

03:02:49.590 --> 03:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
we're
 
03:02:51.590 --> 03:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
paying is the money that when they do
 
03:02:53.670 --> 03:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
hit the medicaid threshold this is the
 
03:02:56.070 --> 03:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
money this is our portion so to speak of
 
03:03:00.389 --> 03:03:00.399 align:start position:0%
the money that is expended for medicaid
 
03:03:02.150 --> 03:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative durf i'm not sure if
 
03:03:04.230 --> 03:03:04.240 align:start position:0%
you're asking about the money in the
 
03:03:06.870 --> 03:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
bill or the money in general
 
03:03:08.389 --> 03:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
the money in general i'm sorry so
 
03:03:10.630 --> 03:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
essentially this will raise the
 
03:03:13.190 --> 03:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
threshold so they will no longer be in
 
03:03:14.950 --> 03:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
that going back and forth they'll be on
 
03:03:14.960 --> 03:03:18.150 align:start position:0%
that going back and forth they'll be on
medicaid

03:03:18.150 --> 03:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:20.070 --> 03:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:03:20.080 --> 03:03:21.349 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

03:03:21.349 --> 03:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:03:23.590 --> 03:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
everybody clear on that no
 
03:03:23.600 --> 03:03:24.469 align:start position:0%
everybody clear on that no
but

03:03:24.469 --> 03:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:03:24.479 --> 03:03:27.590 align:start position:0%
but
yes

03:03:27.590 --> 03:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:29.750 --> 03:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i have uh i have never heard of
 
03:03:32.389 --> 03:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
medicaid in and out before but
 
03:03:33.990 --> 03:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
i have now
 
03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:35.830 align:start position:0%
i have now
yeah

03:03:35.830 --> 03:03:35.840 align:start position:0%

comment on this uh yes ma'am this is uh
 
03:05:35.910 --> 03:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
this is one of three bills we're going
 
03:05:39.030 --> 03:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
to talk about today where um
 
03:05:41.590 --> 03:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
between the time that the
 
03:05:43.750 --> 03:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
policy committee amended it and the time
 
03:05:47.510 --> 03:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:49.750 --> 03:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
there was a realization that the uh
 
03:05:52.150 --> 03:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal note no longer applied and so it
 
03:05:54.790 --> 03:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have a fiscal impact and in those
 
03:05:56.550 --> 03:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
three cases this being the first one
 
03:06:01.670 --> 03:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
today uh we'll just uh put it otp
 
03:06:04.389 --> 03:06:04.399 align:start position:0%
and put it on consent so since there's
 
03:06:07.190 --> 03:06:07.200 align:start position:0%
no financial issue
 
03:06:09.510 --> 03:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i can i can speak to the bill but
 
03:06:11.990 --> 03:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's almost irrelevant that's fine
 
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%

03:08:30.230 --> 03:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay would you like to speak to your
 
03:08:33.590 --> 03:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
motion uh thank you madam chair um
 
03:08:35.030 --> 03:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh as
 
03:08:37.830 --> 03:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
as the bill came over to division three
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
we had a significant concern
 
03:08:42.790 --> 03:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
because um
 
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to put the state in
 
03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
jeopardy of having cms withhold
 
03:08:50.950 --> 03:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
medicaid money from us between the
 
03:08:52.630 --> 03:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
medicaid money and money to nursing
 
03:08:55.990 --> 03:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
homes about 160 million a year was at
 
03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:57.110 align:start position:0%
homes about 160 million a year was at
stake

03:08:57.110 --> 03:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
stake
 
03:08:59.590 --> 03:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
so what this amendment does
 
03:09:00.710 --> 03:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
is it
 
03:09:02.710 --> 03:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
keeps us on the right side of the bright
 
03:09:05.590 --> 03:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
line uh and and and keeps the funding
 
03:09:05.600 --> 03:09:06.790 align:start position:0%
line uh and and and keeps the funding
secure

03:09:06.790 --> 03:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
secure
 
03:09:09.590 --> 03:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does is um
 
03:09:11.030 --> 03:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh the first thing
 
03:09:13.510 --> 03:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
it does is what it doesn't do it it
 
03:09:13.520 --> 03:09:14.630 align:start position:0%
it does is what it doesn't do it it
deleted

03:09:14.630 --> 03:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
deleted
 
03:09:16.550 --> 03:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
write a conscience as a way to
 
03:09:21.190 --> 03:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
seek an exemption
 
03:09:24.309 --> 03:09:24.319 align:start position:0%
cms doesn't recognize that so so this
 
03:09:26.630 --> 03:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
amendment deletes the right of
 
03:09:26.640 --> 03:09:28.309 align:start position:0%
amendment deletes the right of
conscience

03:09:28.309 --> 03:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
03:09:31.990 --> 03:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
then on the medical exemption
 
03:09:34.790 --> 03:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh we made it very clear that we're
 
03:09:37.269 --> 03:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
going to be following the documentation
 
03:09:40.070 --> 03:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
requirements of cms to apply for a
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
medical exemption and so that that puts
 
03:09:44.790 --> 03:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
us into conformance
 
03:09:45.990 --> 03:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:09:48.870 --> 03:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
the the third thing which may be the
 
03:09:50.630 --> 03:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
biggest thing and the thing the primary
 
03:09:52.469 --> 03:09:52.479 align:start position:0%
sponsor likes
 
03:09:56.070 --> 03:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
is that it establishes
 
03:09:57.590 --> 03:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
religious exemption in our law such that
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh an individual can go to their
 
03:10:04.080 --> 03:10:05.190 align:start position:0%
uh an individual can go to their
employer

03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
employer
 
03:10:08.309 --> 03:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
and do a self-attestation that they have
 
03:10:13.110 --> 03:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
a sincerely um held religious belief
 
03:10:14.550 --> 03:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
and it
 
03:10:14.560 --> 03:10:15.830 align:start position:0%
and it
effectively

03:10:15.830 --> 03:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
03:10:18.229 --> 03:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
takes the employer
 
03:10:21.510 --> 03:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
out of the mode of
 
03:10:23.510 --> 03:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
judging whether or not it's a real
 
03:10:25.110 --> 03:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
religious belief
 
03:10:28.550 --> 03:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
the you know federal government
 
03:10:31.590 --> 03:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
is there to protect freedom of religion
 
03:10:34.389 --> 03:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
and it should not be delegating power to
 
03:10:37.349 --> 03:10:37.359 align:start position:0%
an employer to sit in judgment of an
 
03:10:38.950 --> 03:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
individual's religious belief they're
 
03:10:41.110 --> 03:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
not qualified it's not part of their hr
 
03:10:43.910 --> 03:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
department so so what this does is
 
03:10:47.910 --> 03:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
because the cms rules say that there
 
03:10:50.630 --> 03:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
must be an evaluation process by the
 
03:10:50.640 --> 03:10:52.309 align:start position:0%
must be an evaluation process by the
employer

03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
employer
 
03:10:55.269 --> 03:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
we specify in this bill that the
 
03:10:58.550 --> 03:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
evaluation process consists of
 
03:11:01.110 --> 03:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
validating that the person is uh
 
03:11:03.750 --> 03:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
legitimately covered by the policy that
 
03:11:06.309 --> 03:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
they're using the appropriate form
 
03:11:08.389 --> 03:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
that they've signed and dated
 
03:11:08.399 --> 03:11:09.190 align:start position:0%
that they've signed and dated
it

03:11:09.190 --> 03:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:11:11.670 --> 03:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh and then their obligations as part of
 
03:11:13.830 --> 03:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
the evaluation effort is to go ahead and
 
03:11:16.469 --> 03:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
put a date time stamp on it store the
 
03:11:18.389 --> 03:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
record for at least a year
 
03:11:21.830 --> 03:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
and um and then the the most evaluative
 
03:11:25.670 --> 03:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
part is they can deny it if they have
 
03:11:25.680 --> 03:11:26.550 align:start position:0%
part is they can deny it if they have
um

03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:29.590 --> 03:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh reasons to believe strong reasons to
 
03:11:32.229 --> 03:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
believe that there may be fraud at place
 
03:11:34.070 --> 03:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
and filing the request
 
03:11:34.080 --> 03:11:35.110 align:start position:0%
and filing the request
so

03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
so this gives us
 
03:11:39.990 --> 03:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
a clear religious exemption um that we
 
03:11:42.710 --> 03:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't have before so i would ask you
 
03:11:45.429 --> 03:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
to accept this amendment uh
 
03:11:47.990 --> 03:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
that effectively replaces the the body
 
03:11:50.710 --> 03:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
of 1604.
 
03:11:53.429 --> 03:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other com reps
 
03:11:56.070 --> 03:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
in lynn yes just a question with regard
 
03:11:58.550 --> 03:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
with regard to paragraph
 
03:12:01.269 --> 03:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
e2 the last paragraph on the page the
 
03:12:03.590 --> 03:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
only question i have is i didn't
 
03:12:05.910 --> 03:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
i i didn't see any language in there
 
03:12:07.670 --> 03:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
that says
 
03:12:09.670 --> 03:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
that requires the employer to either
 
03:12:11.269 --> 03:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
accept or either approve or deny the
 
03:12:13.590 --> 03:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
request and i'm just wondering if that's
 
03:12:16.550 --> 03:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
does does that need to be in there
 
03:12:16.560 --> 03:12:18.229 align:start position:0%
does does that need to be in there
um

03:12:18.229 --> 03:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:19.670 --> 03:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay i
 
03:12:22.070 --> 03:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
i think that's a fair point i thank you
 
03:12:22.080 --> 03:12:22.870 align:start position:0%
i think that's a fair point i thank you
i

03:12:22.870 --> 03:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:12:25.510 --> 03:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
i believe it's covered because it says
 
03:12:27.110 --> 03:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
the written requests for a medical
 
03:12:29.510 --> 03:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
exemption shall include documentation as
 
03:12:31.590 --> 03:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
required by cms
 
03:12:34.229 --> 03:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
and then on line 24 it reads that the
 
03:12:36.790 --> 03:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
employer shall evaluate the request to
 
03:12:39.429 --> 03:12:39.439 align:start position:0%
ensure that the individual submitting is
 
03:12:39.439 --> 03:12:40.229 align:start position:0%
ensure that the individual submitting is
so

03:12:40.229 --> 03:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:12:43.110 --> 03:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
so i i think the fact that they do
 
03:12:46.150 --> 03:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
evaluate it and that they've been given
 
03:12:47.670 --> 03:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
the guidelines of the medical
 
03:12:50.710 --> 03:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
documentation required by cms i i think
 
03:12:54.630 --> 03:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
it covers the the um
 
03:12:56.469 --> 03:12:56.479 align:start position:0%
the evaluation requirement for the
 
03:12:59.670 --> 03:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
employer but i i would defer to your uh
 
03:13:01.429 --> 03:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
judgments you've done this longer than i
 
03:13:01.439 --> 03:13:02.469 align:start position:0%
judgments you've done this longer than i
have

03:13:02.469 --> 03:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:13:03.510 --> 03:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know i guess the only question i
 
03:13:05.110 --> 03:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
mean if it if the
 
03:13:07.030 --> 03:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
if the medicaid
 
03:13:09.429 --> 03:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
regulations sort of say
 
03:13:11.670 --> 03:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
that you know if you submit certain docu
 
03:13:13.590 --> 03:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
if you submit appropriate documentation
 
03:13:14.469 --> 03:13:14.479 align:start position:0%
then the
 
03:13:15.750 --> 03:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:13:17.110 --> 03:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:13:18.790 --> 03:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
you know the exception shall be allowed
 
03:13:19.990 --> 03:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
or something i think then i think i
 
03:13:21.830 --> 03:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
would agree with you if it if it's open
 
03:13:23.349 --> 03:13:23.359 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't really say anything then i
 
03:13:25.990 --> 03:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
i you know that might be an issue but
 
03:13:27.830 --> 03:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
presumably that could be corrected you
 
03:13:29.750 --> 03:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
know by the other body
 
03:13:33.110 --> 03:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
i i think so and i i will admit i did
 
03:13:35.750 --> 03:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
not read the cms uh language on this
 
03:13:35.760 --> 03:13:37.030 align:start position:0%
not read the cms uh language on this
specifically

03:13:37.030 --> 03:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
03:13:40.950 --> 03:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
but i got good counsel advice by
 
03:13:42.389 --> 03:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
people who do
 
03:13:44.389 --> 03:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
dabble in this and and
 
03:13:47.590 --> 03:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
they thought this would be adequate
 
03:13:50.309 --> 03:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:52.070 --> 03:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
are there any further comments or
 
03:13:55.190 --> 03:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent waltz
 
03:13:57.910 --> 03:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
you know when i hear this it seems to me
 
03:14:00.630 --> 03:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
that we're just inviting fraud i mean i
 
03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
i could sit here and say you know i'm a
 
03:14:04.950 --> 03:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
member of the church of tree frogs and i
 
03:14:07.510 --> 03:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
don't believe in vaccinations you know i
 
03:14:07.520 --> 03:14:09.590 align:start position:0%
don't believe in vaccinations you know i
mean

03:14:09.590 --> 03:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
mean
 
03:14:12.630 --> 03:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
we i think we have a responsibility to
 
03:14:16.150 --> 03:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
require at least some basic
 
03:14:16.160 --> 03:14:17.830 align:start position:0%
require at least some basic
uh

03:14:17.830 --> 03:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:14:19.030 --> 03:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
something that can be said with a
 
03:14:20.309 --> 03:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
straight face
 
03:14:22.550 --> 03:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
and this does not do that and that's my
 
03:14:22.560 --> 03:14:25.190 align:start position:0%
and this does not do that and that's my
concern

03:14:25.190 --> 03:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
concern
 
03:14:26.870 --> 03:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
would you like to respond represent
 
03:14:26.880 --> 03:14:28.229 align:start position:0%
would you like to respond represent
edwards

03:14:28.229 --> 03:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
edwards
 
03:14:30.790 --> 03:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you i i think we're in an era
 
03:14:33.429 --> 03:14:33.439 align:start position:0%
where we've just generally accepted the
 
03:14:35.830 --> 03:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
ability of people to self-identify in
 
03:14:37.110 --> 03:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
the way that they choose to
 
03:14:37.120 --> 03:14:38.630 align:start position:0%
the way that they choose to
self-identify

03:14:38.630 --> 03:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
self-identify
 
03:14:40.630 --> 03:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
and given that religious freedom is
 
03:14:42.870 --> 03:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
explicitly part of our constitution i
 
03:14:45.510 --> 03:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
just don't think the government is in a
 
03:14:48.229 --> 03:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
position to evaluate whether or not it's
 
03:14:50.469 --> 03:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
a truly held religious belief
 
03:14:52.070 --> 03:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
particularly when people can
 
03:14:55.349 --> 03:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
self-identify as almost anything and
 
03:14:57.750 --> 03:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
have their pronouns changed it just
 
03:14:59.670 --> 03:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
seems to me that we ought to extend that
 
03:15:01.910 --> 03:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
level of tolerance to the religious
 
03:15:01.920 --> 03:15:03.910 align:start position:0%
level of tolerance to the religious
community

03:15:03.910 --> 03:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:15:05.269 --> 03:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:15:06.790 --> 03:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative waltz
 
03:15:09.110 --> 03:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
but we as a government do question those
 
03:15:10.870 --> 03:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
things if you want to claim to be a
 
03:15:13.349 --> 03:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
conscientious objector for the military
 
03:15:15.510 --> 03:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
purposes you have a pretty high bar to
 
03:15:17.830 --> 03:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
prove it it's not unusual for the
 
03:15:20.229 --> 03:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
government to want to see some serious
 
03:15:22.710 --> 03:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
proof that this is a genuine belief from
 
03:15:24.870 --> 03:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
a real religion and i'm not sure what
 
03:15:27.429 --> 03:15:27.439 align:start position:0%
the distinction is between say the
 
03:15:29.670 --> 03:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
military requiring it and i was just
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
accepting this and me and my tree frog
 
03:15:33.349 --> 03:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
religion i mean what's the difference
 
03:15:33.359 --> 03:15:37.429 align:start position:0%
religion i mean what's the difference
here

03:15:37.429 --> 03:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:39.670 --> 03:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
03:15:43.030 --> 03:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:45.269 --> 03:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
i i think this is just going to be one
 
03:15:47.910 --> 03:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
of those areas in which
 
03:15:49.990 --> 03:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
different principles
 
03:15:52.790 --> 03:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
clash and don't fit together very well
 
03:15:52.800 --> 03:15:53.910 align:start position:0%
clash and don't fit together very well
but

03:15:53.910 --> 03:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:15:58.469 --> 03:15:58.479 align:start position:0%
given that some self-identity is
 
03:16:00.830 --> 03:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
identified in the constitution as being
 
03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
protected and yet we're extending
 
03:16:06.150 --> 03:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
self-identity and pronouns to people who
 
03:16:08.150 --> 03:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
don't find that protection in the
 
03:16:12.229 --> 03:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
constitution specifically i i i think
 
03:16:14.790 --> 03:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
that it's perfectly appropriate for us
 
03:16:17.030 --> 03:16:17.040 align:start position:0%

03:16:33.429 --> 03:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
i i will support this amendment but i
 
03:16:35.190 --> 03:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
will point out that i i think there are
 
03:16:38.070 --> 03:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
some inconsistencies uh between this
 
03:16:39.670 --> 03:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
bill and some other bills that we've
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
passed in the uh in the house i do like
 
03:16:45.750 --> 03:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
how we you have um
 
03:16:48.070 --> 03:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
a delineated rather wealthy religious
 
03:16:48.080 --> 03:16:49.590 align:start position:0%
a delineated rather wealthy religious
exemption

03:16:49.590 --> 03:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
03:16:52.309 --> 03:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
i i am not a fan that the right of
 
03:16:54.790 --> 03:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
conscience has been removed only because
 
03:16:56.950 --> 03:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
for those individuals who don't have a
 
03:16:59.910 --> 03:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
religion or don't have a medical
 
03:17:02.950 --> 03:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
reason a right of conscience
 
03:17:05.830 --> 03:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
for some of us is can be almost equated
 
03:17:10.710 --> 03:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:13.190 --> 03:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
since we do have other bills in the
 
03:17:16.630 --> 03:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
hopper um i i will support this if it
 
03:17:17.830 --> 03:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
hadn't been for some of those other
 
03:17:19.510 --> 03:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
bills i wouldn't but i will support this
 
03:17:19.520 --> 03:17:20.790 align:start position:0%
bills i wouldn't but i will support this

03:19:30.309 --> 03:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
so so there's really nothing further to
 
03:19:33.349 --> 03:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
say because this amendment uh
 
03:19:37.030 --> 03:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
overwrites and replaces uh most of 1604
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%

so we i think we just had the debate on
it

03:24:11.600 --> 03:24:12.870 align:start position:0%
uh man i'm sure i'd like to move 1609
itl

03:24:12.870 --> 03:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
itl
 
03:24:12.880 --> 03:24:14.229 align:start position:0%
itl
second

03:24:14.229 --> 03:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:24:16.070 --> 03:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
where'd that come from
 
03:24:21.030 --> 03:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh would you like to speak to your
 
03:24:27.229 --> 03:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
1609 has two significant uh financial
 
03:24:33.670 --> 03:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
issues tied to it
 
03:24:35.349 --> 03:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:24:35.359 --> 03:24:36.150 align:start position:0%
um the
the

03:24:36.150 --> 03:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:24:38.150 --> 03:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
most obvious to people
 
03:24:40.630 --> 03:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
is that it institutes a reporting
 
03:24:43.269 --> 03:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
requirement and uh authorizes the money
 
03:24:44.630 --> 03:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
to pay for it
 
03:24:47.190 --> 03:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
um it's been the policy
 
03:24:50.950 --> 03:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
of the house for for a few years now to
 
03:24:53.429 --> 03:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
not collect abortion statistics so that
 
03:24:55.030 --> 03:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
would violate the
 
03:24:57.750 --> 03:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
basically uh truths that we have on the
 
03:24:57.760 --> 03:24:59.269 align:start position:0%
basically uh truths that we have on the
issue

03:24:59.269 --> 03:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
issue
 
03:25:02.950 --> 03:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
and and so i i would not want to support
 
03:25:05.510 --> 03:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
the money to pay for the reporting um
 
03:25:08.389 --> 03:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
because i think that would be an act of
 
03:25:12.070 --> 03:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
bad faith the the other part of this
 
03:25:13.510 --> 03:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:25:16.550 --> 03:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
this bill effectively guts the language
 
03:25:16.560 --> 03:25:17.590 align:start position:0%
this bill effectively guts the language
in

03:25:17.590 --> 03:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:25:21.590 --> 03:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
hb2 relative to the fetal protection act
 
03:25:21.600 --> 03:25:22.950 align:start position:0%
hb2 relative to the fetal protection act
and

03:25:22.950 --> 03:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
there were probably three really
 
03:25:28.630 --> 03:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
critical things that needed to
 
03:25:30.469 --> 03:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
be agreed to
 
03:25:32.070 --> 03:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
by the majority
 
03:25:34.309 --> 03:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
in order to get the budget passed the
 
03:25:37.349 --> 03:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
prior two terms we did not get a budget
 
03:25:39.269 --> 03:25:39.279 align:start position:0%
passed on the first go around we
 
03:25:41.030 --> 03:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
succeeded this time
 
03:25:43.910 --> 03:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
and it was due to
 
03:25:46.070 --> 03:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
looking each other in the eye and making
 
03:25:47.910 --> 03:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
agreements and finding out what we could
 
03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
agree to agree on
 
03:25:51.030 --> 03:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:25:52.070 --> 03:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
given that
 
03:25:54.229 --> 03:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
the finance committee made these
 
03:25:57.030 --> 03:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
promises i think the finance committee
 
03:26:00.150 --> 03:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
is obligated to keep those promises
 
03:26:02.070 --> 03:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
because it's less than a year after we
 
03:26:04.070 --> 03:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
did those agreements and we're just
 
03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
about 14 15 months from needing
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
agreements again
 
03:26:10.389 --> 03:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
and so you can only lose your integrity
 
03:26:12.630 --> 03:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
and and credibility once
 
03:26:17.429 --> 03:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
so i i do not want to support 1609 and
 
03:26:19.030 --> 03:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
and go down the road of not being
 
03:26:21.750 --> 03:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
trusted in the future and violating a
 
03:26:24.469 --> 03:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
commitment made in the past so
 
03:26:26.870 --> 03:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
i recommend itl
 
03:26:30.950 --> 03:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:33.349 --> 03:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh represent walner
 
03:26:35.670 --> 03:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:26:38.070 --> 03:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
i believe that the
 
03:26:40.790 --> 03:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of this bill is is really
 
03:26:42.469 --> 03:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
very minor
 
03:26:45.269 --> 03:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
and this came to us from the policy
 
03:26:45.279 --> 03:26:46.550 align:start position:0%
and this came to us from the policy
committee

03:26:46.550 --> 03:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:26:50.550 --> 03:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
and by doing an itl we have rejected
 
03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
completely what the policy committee has
 
03:26:54.070 --> 03:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
sent to us
 
03:26:56.309 --> 03:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
and i for that reason will be voting
 
03:26:59.990 --> 03:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:02.630 --> 03:27:02.640 align:start position:0%

03:32:25.510 --> 03:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
it it
 
03:32:25.520 --> 03:32:27.030 align:start position:0%

amends

03:32:27.030 --> 03:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
amends
 
03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
the exceptions
 
03:32:30.870 --> 03:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
under which
 
03:32:33.429 --> 03:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
an abortion is permissible
 
03:32:36.790 --> 03:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
after 24 weeks by adding
 
03:32:36.800 --> 03:32:37.670 align:start position:0%
after 24 weeks by adding
that

03:32:37.670 --> 03:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:32:40.710 --> 03:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
in the case of fetal abnormalities
 
03:32:42.870 --> 03:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life
 
03:32:42.880 --> 03:32:43.750 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life
or

03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:32:45.510 --> 03:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
a medical emergency
 
03:32:45.520 --> 03:32:46.229 align:start position:0%
a medical emergency
so

03:32:46.229 --> 03:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:49.110 --> 03:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
the fetal abnormalities incompatible
 
03:32:50.389 --> 03:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
with life
 
03:32:53.110 --> 03:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
deals with those scenarios of public
 
03:32:53.120 --> 03:32:54.229 align:start position:0%
deals with those scenarios of public
concern

03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
concern
 
03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
where uh
 
03:32:58.710 --> 03:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
the mother finds out that the child's
 
03:32:58.720 --> 03:33:00.229 align:start position:0%
the mother finds out that the child's
survivability

03:33:00.229 --> 03:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
survivability
 
03:33:00.239 --> 03:33:01.190 align:start position:0%
survivability
is

03:33:01.190 --> 03:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:33:02.790 --> 03:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
is really very low
 
03:33:04.950 --> 03:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
and it provides
 
03:33:07.990 --> 03:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
the option of an abortion i i think in
 
03:33:09.990 --> 03:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
most cases
 
03:33:12.710 --> 03:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
the safer medical procedure at that
 
03:33:14.790 --> 03:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
point is to go ahead and deliver the
 
03:33:14.800 --> 03:33:15.990 align:start position:0%
point is to go ahead and deliver the
child

03:33:15.990 --> 03:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:33:19.190 --> 03:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
but that's really a medical choice that
 
03:33:20.790 --> 03:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
we would be leaving
 
03:33:24.229 --> 03:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
to the mother and her physician by
 
03:33:26.309 --> 03:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
creating this fetal abnormalities
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life option
 
03:33:32.229 --> 03:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing it does
 
03:33:32.239 --> 03:33:34.150 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing it does
is

03:33:34.150 --> 03:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:33:36.309 --> 03:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
the hb2 language
 
03:33:36.319 --> 03:33:38.550 align:start position:0%
the hb2 language
already

03:33:38.550 --> 03:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:33:40.389 --> 03:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
made it clear
 
03:33:40.399 --> 03:33:41.670 align:start position:0%
made it clear
that

03:33:41.670 --> 03:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:33:44.950 --> 03:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
the ultrasound requirement was really
 
03:33:48.309 --> 03:33:48.319 align:start position:0%
only going to be subject to penalty
 
03:33:50.309 --> 03:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
if the provider
 
03:33:53.670 --> 03:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
did not adequately back up their 24-week
 
03:33:56.309 --> 03:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
determination there was there was never
 
03:34:00.229 --> 03:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
a case where at 8 weeks or ten weeks
 
03:34:02.950 --> 03:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
that we were mandating a medical
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
or an obstetric ultrasound and in order
 
03:34:08.469 --> 03:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
to make the law clear
 
03:34:11.670 --> 03:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
we've added the following phrase to
 
03:34:13.830 --> 03:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph one
 
03:34:16.550 --> 03:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
saying this paragraph shall be construed
 
03:34:18.389 --> 03:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
to require the performance of an
 
03:34:20.950 --> 03:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
ultrasound only if the provider either
 
03:34:23.750 --> 03:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
knows that the fetus has a gestational
 
03:34:27.110 --> 03:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
age of at least 24 weeks or is conscious
 
03:34:30.469 --> 03:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
of a substantial risk that the fetus has
 
03:34:32.950 --> 03:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
a gestational age of at least
 
03:34:34.790 --> 03:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
24 weeks
 
03:34:34.800 --> 03:34:36.550 align:start position:0%
24 weeks
so

03:34:36.550 --> 03:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:38.710 --> 03:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
i think this bill
 
03:34:41.269 --> 03:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
this amendment addresses
 
03:34:41.279 --> 03:34:42.389 align:start position:0%
this amendment addresses
most

03:34:42.389 --> 03:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
most
 
03:34:46.309 --> 03:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
of the concerns uh of many um to include
 
03:34:48.309 --> 03:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
myself i think this is really good
 
03:34:48.319 --> 03:34:49.510 align:start position:0%
myself i think this is really good
policy

03:34:49.510 --> 03:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
policy
 
03:34:51.590 --> 03:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
and it's something that i'd be i'm i'm
 
03:34:53.670 --> 03:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
proud to offer this amendment
 
03:34:53.680 --> 03:34:54.550 align:start position:0%
proud to offer this amendment
so

03:34:54.550 --> 03:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:34:57.590 --> 03:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
i i would ask for your support
 
03:34:59.670 --> 03:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if i should keep tap
 
03:35:02.389 --> 03:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
dancing until our chairman comes back
 
03:35:02.399 --> 03:35:03.670 align:start position:0%
dancing until our chairman comes back
um

03:35:03.670 --> 03:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
if you have anything further you keep
 
03:35:07.190 --> 03:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
wanna and and then representative eric
 
03:35:10.070 --> 03:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
has has it come okay i i would i would
 
03:35:12.469 --> 03:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
just say that this this basically i
 
03:35:14.630 --> 03:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
think uh has been coordinated with
 
03:35:17.910 --> 03:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
enough people prior to this meeting that
 
03:35:20.950 --> 03:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh we're not this this this would not
 
03:35:24.309 --> 03:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
represent a break in good faith with the
 
03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
people that we made our initial budget
 
03:35:27.830 --> 03:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
agreement with
 
03:35:30.309 --> 03:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
we worked very hard to talk to a lot of
 
03:35:30.319 --> 03:35:31.349 align:start position:0%
we worked very hard to talk to a lot of
people

03:35:31.349 --> 03:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:35:33.349 --> 03:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
and and this
 
03:35:35.269 --> 03:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
this i think
 
03:35:37.990 --> 03:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
can be acceptable to the majority in the
 
03:35:40.229 --> 03:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
house that's my belief
 
03:35:42.630 --> 03:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative lynn i'm i'm happy to
 
03:35:44.630 --> 03:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
let you talk a little bit i i'm not the
 
03:35:46.710 --> 03:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
chair so are you the chair now
 
03:35:50.790 --> 03:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:50.800 --> 03:35:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:35:54.070 --> 03:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:56.389 --> 03:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
i believe there was a drafting error on
 
03:35:57.990 --> 03:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
olessa's part
 
03:36:00.309 --> 03:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
the in section one
 
03:36:01.990 --> 03:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
the fetal abnormalities in competitive
 
03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:02.790 align:start position:0%
the fetal abnormalities in competitive
life

03:36:02.790 --> 03:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
life
 
03:36:02.800 --> 03:36:04.150 align:start position:0%
life
phrase

03:36:04.150 --> 03:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
phrase
 
03:36:06.469 --> 03:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
um should not have been there that
 
03:36:09.349 --> 03:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
phrase is actually in section two
 
03:36:10.630 --> 03:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
except in the case of fetal
 
03:36:12.550 --> 03:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
abnormalities compatible life or a
 
03:36:14.630 --> 03:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
medical emergency i specified
 
03:36:19.990 --> 03:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:22.710 --> 03:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
okay so uh obviously as you know mr
 
03:36:25.349 --> 03:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
ripple for lba coordinates this with ols
 
03:36:26.790 --> 03:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
and when he and i talked about it
 
03:36:29.670 --> 03:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday it's ols's recommendation that
 
03:36:35.910 --> 03:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:38.150 --> 03:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative lin for a comment thank
 
03:36:40.550 --> 03:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
you i i um i
 
03:36:41.910 --> 03:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
i guess i would have been i would have
 
03:36:43.190 --> 03:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
been inclined the same way with
 
03:36:44.550 --> 03:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
representative earth but if they if
 
03:36:46.229 --> 03:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
there's reasons i i that's not a big
 
03:36:48.950 --> 03:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
deal for me but um i would like to thank
 
03:36:50.790 --> 03:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
you representatives for this for this
 
03:36:52.229 --> 03:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
amendment i think
 
03:36:52.239 --> 03:36:53.429 align:start position:0%
amendment i think
um

03:36:53.429 --> 03:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
to me
 
03:36:56.950 --> 03:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
this this amendment is is
 
03:36:58.710 --> 03:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
crucial and and makes all the difference
 
03:37:00.389 --> 03:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
in the world if i could i'd like to just
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
make four brief points
 
03:37:03.990 --> 03:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
first to me
 
03:37:06.950 --> 03:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment corrects a significant
 
03:37:09.750 --> 03:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
two significant flaws in the current
 
03:37:11.670 --> 03:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
fetal life protection act
 
03:37:13.750 --> 03:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
and i want to i also want to say here
 
03:37:15.670 --> 03:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
i'm very grateful to the governor's
 
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
office for the for inputs that they've
 
03:37:20.550 --> 03:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
that they've provided on this
 
03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
first the fetal abnormalities
 
03:37:24.870 --> 03:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with life it seems to me is
 
03:37:27.030 --> 03:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
critically important for the for the
 
03:37:29.670 --> 03:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
reasons that you pointed out um
 
03:37:31.590 --> 03:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
that was the reason that i've personally
 
03:37:34.070 --> 03:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
i voted against h.b 16
 
03:37:34.080 --> 03:37:35.510 align:start position:0%
i voted against h.b 16
73

03:37:35.510 --> 03:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
73
 
03:37:38.309 --> 03:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that in that situation of
 
03:37:40.229 --> 03:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
a fetal abnormality inconsistent with
 
03:37:42.950 --> 03:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
life it is just too much for the
 
03:37:45.030 --> 03:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
government to step in and say you will
 
03:37:47.429 --> 03:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
have the baby that just seems to me we
 
03:37:49.750 --> 03:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
that that's a decision for the mother
 
03:37:52.150 --> 03:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
um and secondly i think as you pointed
 
03:37:54.630 --> 03:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
out also it corrects to the extent there
 
03:37:56.469 --> 03:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
could have been any misunderstanding of
 
03:37:58.550 --> 03:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
of the ultrasound requirement this
 
03:38:01.269 --> 03:38:01.279 align:start position:0%
language it seems to me corrects it
 
03:38:03.750 --> 03:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
um the other two points that i unders as
 
03:38:05.990 --> 03:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
i understand that people have have sort
 
03:38:06.000 --> 03:38:06.710 align:start position:0%
i understand that people have have sort
of

03:38:06.710 --> 03:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:38:09.190 --> 03:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
complained about the current fetal life
 
03:38:12.389 --> 03:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
protection act it seems to me that i i
 
03:38:14.469 --> 03:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
don't think that those criticisms are
 
03:38:17.190 --> 03:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
well taken first of all to the extent
 
03:38:20.229 --> 03:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
that that the original 1609 before this
 
03:38:20.239 --> 03:38:21.190 align:start position:0%
that that the original 1609 before this
amendment

03:38:21.190 --> 03:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:38:21.200 --> 03:38:22.710 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

03:38:22.710 --> 03:38:22.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:25.349 --> 03:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
adds as the la as the word health in
 
03:38:26.790 --> 03:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
certain places
 
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and the claim has been that the
 
03:38:30.790 --> 03:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
current law does not have a health
 
03:38:33.750 --> 03:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
exception that is just that is just
 
03:38:37.269 --> 03:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
wrong if you read the last clause
 
03:38:40.070 --> 03:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
of our of current rsa
 
03:38:43.510 --> 03:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
329 44 roman numeral 3
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
it clearly does that clearly does
 
03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
constitute a health exception
 
03:38:52.229 --> 03:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
it is a restricted health exception it
 
03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
it means for example that there needs to
 
03:38:57.510 --> 03:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
be some some significant risk to a
 
03:39:00.070 --> 03:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
substantial to an important bodily
 
03:39:00.080 --> 03:39:01.189 align:start position:0%
substantial to an important bodily
function

03:39:01.189 --> 03:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
function
 
03:39:03.750 --> 03:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
but the current 1609 without this
 
03:39:06.389 --> 03:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
amendment where it simply says health
 
03:39:08.070 --> 03:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
that i i think really would
 
03:39:11.110 --> 03:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
significantly undermine the current law
 
03:39:13.030 --> 03:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
it would basically say that if somebody
 
03:39:15.590 --> 03:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
says you know i'm i will be really
 
03:39:17.670 --> 03:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
depressed if i have to have this baby
 
03:39:19.429 --> 03:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
that would be enough to say then you
 
03:39:21.030 --> 03:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
don't then you're entitled to have an
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
abortion beyond the 24 weeks and
 
03:39:27.670 --> 03:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
secondly to the extent that the um that
 
03:39:32.070 --> 03:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
the criticism has been there is no uh
 
03:39:33.510 --> 03:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's no uh
 
03:39:35.750 --> 03:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
rape or incest exception again i would
 
03:39:37.349 --> 03:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
take issue with that
 
03:39:40.630 --> 03:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
the very fact that you have 24 weeks to
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
make that the woman has 24 weeks to make
 
03:39:45.189 --> 03:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
that decision our own it seems to me
 
03:39:47.030 --> 03:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
that really it that really covers that
 
03:39:49.349 --> 03:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
certainly if somebody's been been raped
 
03:39:51.670 --> 03:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
they they know on that when it happened
 
03:39:53.030 --> 03:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
that they've been raped and they have
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
six months basically to make the
 
03:39:57.030 --> 03:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
decision whether to have an abortion or
 
03:39:59.030 --> 03:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
not and the last point i would make for
 
03:40:00.790 --> 03:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
number four is simply
 
03:40:01.910 --> 03:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
to the extent that there's been
 
03:40:05.830 --> 03:40:05.840 align:start position:0%
criticism about the fact that the bill
 
03:40:07.830 --> 03:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
that the current law has a penalty
 
03:40:07.840 --> 03:40:08.870 align:start position:0%
that the current law has a penalty
provision

03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
provision
 
03:40:11.349 --> 03:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh that that subjects doctors to
 
03:40:13.990 --> 03:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties i think it's really
 
03:40:16.710 --> 03:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
important to understand that there is no
 
03:40:19.990 --> 03:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
danger of doctors being inadvertent of
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
inadvertently becoming criminals because
 
03:40:25.189 --> 03:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
the current law has this very specific
 
03:40:27.910 --> 03:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
men's rear requirement that provides
 
03:40:30.630 --> 03:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
that before a doctor can be convicted he
 
03:40:33.110 --> 03:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
has to act or he or she has to act
 
03:40:35.590 --> 03:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
either knowing that he's performing an
 
03:40:38.710 --> 03:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
abortion on a 20 on a post 20 or 24 or
 
03:40:38.720 --> 03:40:40.710 align:start position:0%
abortion on a 20 on a post 20 or 24 or
post

03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
post
 
03:40:43.830 --> 03:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
fetus or consciously disregards that
 
03:40:45.349 --> 03:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's enough to say the
 
03:40:46.870 --> 03:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
doctor should have known that's not
 
03:40:49.670 --> 03:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
enough the doctor has to actually have
 
03:40:53.590 --> 03:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
known or have consciously disregarded um
 
03:40:56.870 --> 03:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
so i think that this this amendment i i
 
03:41:00.389 --> 03:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
think is a corrects what i see as the
 
03:41:02.389 --> 03:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
as the problems in the existing law
 
03:41:04.950 --> 03:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
while not in any way gutting the law so
 
03:41:08.229 --> 03:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
i intend to support this amendment
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you are there any other
 
03:41:10.319 --> 03:41:13.670 align:start position:0%
uh thank you are there any other
comments

03:41:13.670 --> 03:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:15.269 --> 03:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
i'll rub some moonie
 
03:41:16.710 --> 03:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:41:20.469 --> 03:41:20.479 align:start position:0%
i can appreciate uh the thought here
 
03:41:20.479 --> 03:41:21.750 align:start position:0%
i can appreciate uh the thought here
however

03:41:21.750 --> 03:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:41:23.910 --> 03:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
on the amendment and i'm looking at line
 
03:41:23.920 --> 03:41:26.070 align:start position:0%
on the amendment and i'm looking at line
10

03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
10
 
03:41:27.349 --> 03:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
i see
 
03:41:30.870 --> 03:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
it was added their fetal abnormalities
 
03:41:34.870 --> 03:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life comma or
 
03:41:36.790 --> 03:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
in the discussions i have just been
 
03:41:38.150 --> 03:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
privy to
 
03:41:40.229 --> 03:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
i'm only hearing that that's in there
 
03:41:43.030 --> 03:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
because ols decided to
 
03:41:45.429 --> 03:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
to me that's unacceptable
 
03:41:47.910 --> 03:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
i would ask that we have another
 
03:41:51.670 --> 03:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
amendment where that language in line 10
 
03:41:52.790 --> 03:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
is not
 
03:41:55.110 --> 03:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
included and if we have to recess then
 
03:41:56.469 --> 03:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
madam chair i would ask that that be
 
03:41:56.479 --> 03:41:57.510 align:start position:0%
madam chair i would ask that that be
done

03:41:57.510 --> 03:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:41:58.630 --> 03:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:42:00.950 --> 03:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
may i address that
 
03:42:03.510 --> 03:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
oh yes you may okay so
 
03:42:04.950 --> 03:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
in the existing
 
03:42:04.960 --> 03:42:06.070 align:start position:0%
in the existing
statute

03:42:06.070 --> 03:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:42:09.670 --> 03:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
the the portion at the end of line 10
 
03:42:13.590 --> 03:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
already exists it already says a medical
 
03:42:16.950 --> 03:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
emergency as specified defined okay
 
03:42:18.630 --> 03:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
so so
 
03:42:20.150 --> 03:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
in this
 
03:42:22.469 --> 03:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
write-up there are
 
03:42:25.349 --> 03:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
that that remains but we're also
 
03:42:28.469 --> 03:42:28.479 align:start position:0%
inserting a fetal abnormalities
 
03:42:30.790 --> 03:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life
 
03:42:32.790 --> 03:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
exception as well
 
03:42:32.800 --> 03:42:33.590 align:start position:0%
exception as well
the

03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:36.550 --> 03:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
repeating of it because oos suggested it
 
03:42:38.389 --> 03:42:38.399 align:start position:0%
is the one down on page
 
03:42:38.399 --> 03:42:40.070 align:start position:0%
is the one down on page
23

03:42:40.070 --> 03:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
23
 
03:42:42.710 --> 03:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
where that same language is repeated on
 
03:42:44.630 --> 03:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
23 and 24.
 
03:42:45.990 --> 03:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:42:48.790 --> 03:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
i i think if one
 
03:42:50.150 --> 03:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
is okay
 
03:42:52.070 --> 03:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
with adding
 
03:42:55.110 --> 03:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
a fetal abnormalities incompatible with
 
03:42:57.990 --> 03:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
life exception that this is properly
 
03:43:02.309 --> 03:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:04.229 --> 03:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:06.229 --> 03:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for us to have a uh
 
03:43:11.189 --> 03:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
a caucus
 
03:43:11.199 --> 03:43:12.229 align:start position:0%
a caucus
yes

03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:43:16.229 --> 03:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:21.429 --> 03:43:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:24.229 --> 03:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
is uh 10 minutes enough
 
03:43:26.550 --> 03:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
i think 10 minutes okay so we'll recess
 
03:43:27.990 --> 03:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
for 10 minutes
 
03:43:28.000 --> 03:43:29.429 align:start position:0%
for 10 minutes
uh

03:43:29.429 --> 03:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:43:31.349 --> 03:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
yeah the republicans will meet in
 
03:43:32.790 --> 03:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
division one
 
03:43:35.189 --> 03:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
and the democrats will meet in division
 
03:43:35.199 --> 03:43:36.469 align:start position:0%
and the democrats will meet in division
two

03:58:28.830 --> 03:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
we're gonna call this let me
 
03:58:30.790 --> 03:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
see okay

03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
i have no idea what
 
03:58:40.150 --> 03:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
what's proper to say
 
03:58:40.160 --> 03:58:40.950 align:start position:0%
what's proper to say
but

03:58:40.950 --> 03:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:58:44.550 --> 03:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
we are waiting on an amendment
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
to hb 1609
 
03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:58:52.389 --> 03:58:52.399 align:start position:0%
i would like to proceed
 
03:58:54.550 --> 03:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
to the other
 
03:58:54.560 --> 03:58:55.510 align:start position:0%

03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
that hhs has and i'm a little annoyed
 
03:59:02.950 --> 03:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
because representative edwards promised
 
03:59:08.710 --> 03:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:13.269 --> 03:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:15.110 --> 03:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
not yet
 
03:59:20.630 --> 03:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
hb 1622 relative to mental health parity
 
03:59:23.269 --> 03:59:23.279 align:start position:0%
is an otp
 
03:59:25.590 --> 03:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
do i have a motion
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
so moved do i have a second
 
03:59:33.429 --> 03:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:36.229 --> 03:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
03:59:38.469 --> 03:59:38.479 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am this is uh the third of the
 
03:59:40.870 --> 03:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
three where um
 
03:59:40.880 --> 03:59:41.590 align:start position:0%
three where um
the

03:59:41.590 --> 03:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:59:44.389 --> 03:59:44.399 align:start position:0%
policy committee made an amendment
 
03:59:46.309 --> 03:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
and after that
 
03:59:49.189 --> 03:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
there was no um fiscal note any longer
 
03:59:50.950 --> 03:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
no fiscal impact
 
03:59:50.960 --> 03:59:51.990 align:start position:0%
no fiscal impact
so

03:59:51.990 --> 03:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:55.510 --> 03:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
like the other two i recommend we otp
 
03:59:56.870 --> 03:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
this and
 
03:59:59.189 --> 03:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
subsequently put it on consent

poisoning testing
 
04:02:09.590 --> 04:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
in the same way in which
 
04:02:12.870 --> 04:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
the immunization program is is is
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
managed and the offensive part of that
 
04:02:21.189 --> 04:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
is that it places authority in the
 
04:02:21.199 --> 04:02:22.630 align:start position:0%
is that it places authority in the
schools

04:02:22.630 --> 04:02:22.640 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:02:24.790 --> 04:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
for example in the in the day care
 
04:02:27.670 --> 04:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
centers but i'm more concerned about the
 
04:02:31.110 --> 04:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
schools actually it it it requires them
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
to become an enforcement arm
 
04:02:35.110 --> 04:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
04:02:35.120 --> 04:02:36.229 align:start position:0%
of the state
to

04:02:36.229 --> 04:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that parents are complying with
 
04:02:42.469 --> 04:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
the lead poison testing
 
04:02:44.469 --> 04:02:44.479 align:start position:0%
now we had testimony
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
that suggested that after two years of
 
04:02:49.349 --> 04:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic and lockdowns
 
04:02:52.150 --> 04:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
not surprisingly compliance with the
 
04:02:52.160 --> 04:02:53.750 align:start position:0%
not surprisingly compliance with the
lead

04:02:53.750 --> 04:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
lead
 
04:02:55.590 --> 04:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
poison testing
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
was down around the 67 percent margin
 
04:03:01.110 --> 04:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
and we we want to get that up higher as
 
04:03:01.120 --> 04:03:01.750 align:start position:0%
and we we want to get that up higher as
a

04:03:01.750 --> 04:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:03:03.670 --> 04:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
as a critical element of the public
 
04:03:04.950 --> 04:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
health system
 
04:03:07.990 --> 04:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
but um but rather than
 
04:03:11.349 --> 04:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
essentially empowering the schools to
 
04:03:11.359 --> 04:03:12.550 align:start position:0%
essentially empowering the schools to
enforce

04:03:12.550 --> 04:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
04:03:13.830 --> 04:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
the law
 
04:03:13.840 --> 04:03:15.670 align:start position:0%
the law
um

04:03:15.670 --> 04:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:15.680 --> 04:03:16.710 align:start position:0%
um
we

04:03:16.710 --> 04:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
the majority thought it would be better
 
04:03:20.150 --> 04:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
to have
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
the department put together a parental
 
04:03:25.910 --> 04:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
public education program
 
04:03:25.920 --> 04:03:27.189 align:start position:0%
public education program
because

04:03:27.189 --> 04:03:27.199 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:03:29.750 --> 04:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
most people comply once they realize how
 
04:03:33.750 --> 04:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
important the lead poison testing is
 
04:03:37.030 --> 04:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
and it's just an inappropriate role
 
04:03:38.950 --> 04:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
to have the schools
 
04:03:41.510 --> 04:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
acting as a police
 
04:03:44.469 --> 04:03:44.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement arm of the state
 
04:03:47.110 --> 04:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
their job is to educate children and
 
04:03:48.950 --> 04:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
work in partnership
 
04:03:48.960 --> 04:03:50.070 align:start position:0%
work in partnership
with

04:03:50.070 --> 04:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
the parents
 
04:03:52.950 --> 04:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:03:55.429 --> 04:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
partnership relationship
 
04:03:57.429 --> 04:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
is harmed
 
04:04:01.189 --> 04:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
when the school becomes an authority
 
04:04:03.429 --> 04:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
over the parents it
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
puts the arrows completely in the wrong
 
04:04:09.189 --> 04:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
direction of who's accountable to who
 
04:04:10.630 --> 04:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
so for that
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
i i the majority on the committee
 
04:04:19.590 --> 04:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
recommends uh itl now it's it's possible
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
that the bill can be improved a little
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
you know it but but i'd rather just itl
 
04:04:30.309 --> 04:04:30.319 align:start position:0%
it and uh and be clear about uh about it
 
04:04:31.750 --> 04:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:04:34.309 --> 04:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
are there any further comments
 
04:04:37.670 --> 04:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
so i had some concerns about this
 
04:04:45.510 --> 04:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
bill in
 
04:04:48.150 --> 04:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
the area of both the schools and the
 
04:04:50.870 --> 04:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
child care centers and
 
04:04:54.630 --> 04:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:57.590 --> 04:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
children might be denied entry to child
 
04:04:59.510 --> 04:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
care or might be
 
04:04:59.520 --> 04:05:01.189 align:start position:0%
care or might be
actually

04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:05:03.429 --> 04:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
asked to leave after the six months if
 
04:05:05.590 --> 04:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
they did not have the
 
04:05:07.110 --> 04:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
have the
 
04:05:09.670 --> 04:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
test on the form the information on the
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
form i think it's important i think that
 
04:05:14.389 --> 04:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
having the information on the form is
 
04:05:14.399 --> 04:05:15.670 align:start position:0%
having the information on the form is
important

04:05:15.670 --> 04:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:05:18.309 --> 04:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
i think both the schools and child care
 
04:05:19.750 --> 04:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
can certainly get involved in
 
04:05:21.510 --> 04:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
encouraging parents
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
but i was concerned about the
 
04:05:25.990 --> 04:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
about the
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
whole area of
 
04:05:28.319 --> 04:05:29.590 align:start position:0%
whole area of
denying

04:05:29.590 --> 04:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
denying
 
04:05:31.830 --> 04:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
denying entrance
 
04:05:35.189 --> 04:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
and um i did i will be voting i will be
 
04:05:37.110 --> 04:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
voting against the itl because i think
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
there might have been a better way for
 
04:05:39.830 --> 04:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
us to
 
04:05:55.990 --> 04:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:59.510 --> 04:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that perhaps
 
04:06:01.750 --> 04:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
you don't like the bill as it stands is
 
04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
i did have an amendment drafted um
 
04:06:08.469 --> 04:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
for the division
 
04:06:11.269 --> 04:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
which would have made it clear that um a
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
child could not be denied entry
 
04:06:14.640 --> 04:06:15.510 align:start position:0%
child could not be denied entry
um

04:06:15.510 --> 04:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:18.790 --> 04:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
into a child care facility or removed
 
04:06:21.189 --> 04:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
because they didn't have this on the on
 
04:06:22.710 --> 04:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
the form
 
04:06:25.110 --> 04:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
so i did have that but that um
 
04:06:28.229 --> 04:06:28.239 align:start position:0%
but the itl overrode that amendment okay
 
04:06:32.469 --> 04:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
04:06:33.920 --> 04:06:38.229 align:start position:0%
are there any other

04:06:38.239 --> 04:06:39.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:06:39.189 --> 04:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
okay

04:06:40.399 --> 04:06:42.550 align:start position:0%

man i'm sure
 
04:08:05.110 --> 04:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
i i'm wanting to write the committee
 
04:08:07.349 --> 04:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
report on that and and one of the points
 
04:08:09.349 --> 04:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
i meant to make was that there's an
 
04:08:12.309 --> 04:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
article 28 a issue in here as well
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
because we would be asking the schools
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
for example to become enforcers and
 
04:08:19.030 --> 04:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
we're not going to pay them so that is
 
04:08:21.349 --> 04:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
the definition of an unfunded mandate
 
04:08:23.429 --> 04:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
giving them more work and no more money
 
04:08:23.439 --> 04:08:24.389 align:start position:0%
giving them more work and no more money
okay

04:08:24.389 --> 04:08:24.399 align:start position:0%

which is
 
04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%

number you just said and i'm struggling
 
04:10:00.149 --> 04:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay would you like to speak to your
 
04:10:02.880 --> 04:10:03.910 align:start position:0%
okay would you like to speak to your
motion

04:10:03.910 --> 04:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
motion
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh yes yes ma'am um
 
04:10:09.269 --> 04:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill has two major
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
components to it
 
04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
and uh it passed out of division three
 
04:10:15.590 --> 04:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
four to three
 
04:10:17.590 --> 04:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
with the opposition
 
04:10:19.269 --> 04:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh taking
 
04:10:23.110 --> 04:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
a a incredibly viable perspective
 
04:10:26.070 --> 04:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
that the department was just absolutely
 
04:10:29.670 --> 04:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
unable to give us any financial data
 
04:10:31.110 --> 04:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
upon which that we could make an
 
04:10:33.110 --> 04:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
informed judgment
 
04:10:33.120 --> 04:10:34.469 align:start position:0%
informed judgment
now

04:10:34.469 --> 04:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:10:37.510 --> 04:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
as it turns out in my view
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
in these two components there's a
 
04:10:39.840 --> 04:10:41.030 align:start position:0%
in these two components there's a
component

04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
component
 
04:10:41.040 --> 04:10:42.149 align:start position:0%
component
that

04:10:42.149 --> 04:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:42.159 --> 04:10:43.349 align:start position:0%
that
protects

04:10:43.349 --> 04:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
protects
 
04:10:45.990 --> 04:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
a parent's
 
04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
reserve levels
 
04:10:48.630 --> 04:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:10:50.389 --> 04:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to sustain
 
04:10:54.710 --> 04:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
themselves and and it's been at 115
 
04:10:57.269 --> 04:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
of the federal poverty guideline for
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
quite a while
 
04:11:02.469 --> 04:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
so the the part of the bill
 
04:11:06.030 --> 04:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
increased that self-support reserve to
 
04:11:10.870 --> 04:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
150 150 35 percentage points
 
04:11:12.309 --> 04:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
with this amendment
 
04:11:14.469 --> 04:11:14.479 align:start position:0%
if if if we were to accept that in the
 
04:11:14.479 --> 04:11:15.429 align:start position:0%
if if if we were to accept that in the
bill

04:11:15.429 --> 04:11:15.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:11:17.590 --> 04:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
that's the part that creates the fiscal
 
04:11:17.600 --> 04:11:18.830 align:start position:0%
that's the part that creates the fiscal
uncertainty

04:11:18.830 --> 04:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
uncertainty
 
04:11:21.269 --> 04:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
we what what that
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
that'll do is it will certainly protect
 
04:11:26.229 --> 04:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
parents in the lower income levels from
 
04:11:29.030 --> 04:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
having to pay child support but that
 
04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
means that the state needs to step in
 
04:11:33.030 --> 04:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
and and pay
 
04:11:36.550 --> 04:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
and play a bigger role in
 
04:11:38.870 --> 04:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
child support payments
 
04:11:38.880 --> 04:11:40.149 align:start position:0%
child support payments
so

04:11:40.149 --> 04:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:43.030 --> 04:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
so we don't know how much that is
 
04:11:44.870 --> 04:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
and the department couldn't help us and
 
04:11:46.389 --> 04:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
the department said
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
hey we've got this quadrennial review
 
04:11:50.630 --> 04:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
coming and we'll have a report in
 
04:11:52.630 --> 04:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
december we might have some information
 
04:11:54.389 --> 04:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
for you in december
 
04:11:56.630 --> 04:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
so this amendment says
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
let's freeze
 
04:12:02.229 --> 04:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
the self-support reserve level at 115
 
04:12:02.239 --> 04:12:03.429 align:start position:0%
the self-support reserve level at 115
percent

04:12:03.429 --> 04:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:12:05.670 --> 04:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
until the department can give us the
 
04:12:08.469 --> 04:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
financial data for the finance committee
 
04:12:11.349 --> 04:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
to make an informed decision
 
04:12:14.550 --> 04:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
it allows the second component of this
 
04:12:16.950 --> 04:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
to go forward and i don't want to speak
 
04:12:19.030 --> 04:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
too much about that because that's in
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:25.590 --> 04:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments
 
04:12:27.590 --> 04:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
represent walner
 
04:12:29.349 --> 04:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
so what concerned me about the bill and
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
though representative edwards
 
04:12:37.990 --> 04:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
did come in with this amendment to try
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
to um
 
04:12:42.550 --> 04:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
help make us feel i think more
 
04:12:45.990 --> 04:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable with with the with the bill
 
04:12:48.630 --> 04:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
what what bothered me was that we really
 
04:12:52.070 --> 04:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
the department was not able to give us
 
04:12:52.080 --> 04:12:53.189 align:start position:0%
the department was not able to give us
any

04:12:53.189 --> 04:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:12:56.309 --> 04:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
kind of information about what would
 
04:12:56.319 --> 04:12:57.189 align:start position:0%
kind of information about what would
happen

04:12:57.189 --> 04:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
in situations where
 
04:13:00.000 --> 04:13:00.870 align:start position:0%
in situations where
people

04:13:00.870 --> 04:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:13:03.030 --> 04:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
would find themselves in need of for
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
instance we might increase our tanf
 
04:13:05.040 --> 04:13:06.790 align:start position:0%
instance we might increase our tanf
rolls

04:13:06.790 --> 04:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
rolls
 
04:13:08.229 --> 04:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
we might increase
 
04:13:10.630 --> 04:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
the number the amount of money that was
 
04:13:13.269 --> 04:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
spent for child care
 
04:13:17.670 --> 04:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
the state could be looking at larger
 
04:13:19.110 --> 04:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
food stamp
 
04:13:21.030 --> 04:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility people being eligible for
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
food stamps so
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't really have any of that
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
financial information
 
04:13:28.309 --> 04:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
and though i think he made a good
 
04:13:32.870 --> 04:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be any
 
04:13:38.229 --> 04:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
big changes i
 
04:13:39.990 --> 04:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure that there weren't other
 
04:13:42.469 --> 04:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
parts of the bill that would end up
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
causing us
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
to have a financial
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
impact and um
 
04:13:50.149 --> 04:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
we are the finance committee and i
 
04:13:51.750 --> 04:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
thought we should
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
be getting that kind of information the
 
04:13:54.000 --> 04:13:55.429 align:start position:0%
be getting that kind of information the
department

04:13:55.429 --> 04:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:13:57.990 --> 04:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
did tell us that they are doing a report
 
04:14:00.469 --> 04:14:00.479 align:start position:0%
that is going to be done this during the
 
04:14:02.630 --> 04:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
fall and
 
04:14:03.990 --> 04:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
by december
 
04:14:06.070 --> 04:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
where they will be able to give us that
 
04:14:08.149 --> 04:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
kind of information and i thought it was
 
04:14:08.159 --> 04:14:09.030 align:start position:0%
kind of information and i thought it was
worth

04:14:09.030 --> 04:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
worth
 
04:14:10.790 --> 04:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
waiting to hear that
 
04:14:13.110 --> 04:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
and i would
 
04:14:16.309 --> 04:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
i would have gone for interim study on
 
04:14:18.389 --> 04:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
this i think it is exactly the kind of
 
04:14:20.790 --> 04:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
bill the finance committee should be
 
04:14:22.469 --> 04:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
looking at more closely
 
04:14:23.830 --> 04:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
and interim study would give us the
 
04:14:27.429 --> 04:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:29.590 --> 04:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments represent
 
04:14:29.600 --> 04:14:31.429 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments represent
waltz

04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
waltz
 
04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you manager
 
04:14:33.600 --> 04:14:34.469 align:start position:0%
thank you manager
so

04:14:34.469 --> 04:14:34.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:14:36.309 --> 04:14:36.319 align:start position:0%
i've been here a long time i started in
 
04:14:38.950 --> 04:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
2004 on the children and family law
 
04:14:42.469 --> 04:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
committee and in 2004 is when the state
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
passed the law that basically changed
 
04:14:47.269 --> 04:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
the way we approach
 
04:14:49.349 --> 04:14:49.359 align:start position:0%
shared parenting it was revolutionary at
 
04:14:50.710 --> 04:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
the time we were some of the first in
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
the country if not the first in the
 
04:14:53.189 --> 04:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
world to do it
 
04:14:55.189 --> 04:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
and i served four terms on children and
 
04:14:57.510 --> 04:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
family one of which i was chair and this
 
04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
concept has come up over and over again
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
of trying to tie
 
04:15:06.710 --> 04:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
support to uh time to custody time we
 
04:15:07.990 --> 04:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
don't use the word custody but to
 
04:15:09.910 --> 04:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
parental parental tie time with the
 
04:15:09.920 --> 04:15:10.870 align:start position:0%
parental parental tie time with the
parent

04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
parent
 
04:15:10.880 --> 04:15:11.750 align:start position:0%
parent
and

04:15:11.750 --> 04:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:15:11.760 --> 04:15:12.790 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:15:12.790 --> 04:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
there were always
 
04:15:17.110 --> 04:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
really complicated reasons not to do it
 
04:15:19.510 --> 04:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
and when this came forward this time i
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
was very surprised that it actually
 
04:15:23.429 --> 04:15:23.439 align:start position:0%
passed the committee because
 
04:15:25.269 --> 04:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
over and over when we looked at it it
 
04:15:27.670 --> 04:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
created some very complicated and very
 
04:15:30.870 --> 04:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
expensive results excuse me i'd ask you
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
to talk to the amendment
 
04:15:34.790 --> 04:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
which is um
 
04:15:36.469 --> 04:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
talking about the hundred and fifteen
 
04:15:39.910 --> 04:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
percent when we move to the otpa if
 
04:15:42.710 --> 04:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's what happens then your comments
 
04:15:45.590 --> 04:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
are appropriate thank you so
 
04:15:47.110 --> 04:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
getting to the fact that it had
 
04:15:49.030 --> 04:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
expensive and unintended results the
 
04:15:50.790 --> 04:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
amendment is one of those things that
 
04:15:53.830 --> 04:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
that would do that so there the
 
04:15:55.990 --> 04:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
member who sponsored the amendment said
 
04:15:57.670 --> 04:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
and i wrote this down
 
04:16:00.389 --> 04:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
that 115 of the federal poverty
 
04:16:02.710 --> 04:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
guideline would be enough to sustain the
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
family and
 
04:16:04.800 --> 04:16:05.590 align:start position:0%
family and
well

04:16:05.590 --> 04:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:16:08.790 --> 04:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
sustain to sustain self and then
 
04:16:11.429 --> 04:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
i presume that also means 115 of the
 
04:16:13.830 --> 04:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines would vary depending
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
on how many children there are
 
04:16:15.600 --> 04:16:16.630 align:start position:0%
on how many children there are
so

04:16:16.630 --> 04:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:16:18.950 --> 04:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
that would be to sustain the self and
 
04:16:20.389 --> 04:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
those children when they're with that
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:27.110 --> 04:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay well i did write down sustained
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
self those were the words that you said
 
04:16:30.630 --> 04:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
because i i wanted to be accurate in
 
04:16:33.189 --> 04:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
what i was saying representative
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:16:37.429 --> 04:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that if we pass this
 
04:16:39.670 --> 04:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
we are and particularly at the 115
 
04:16:42.550 --> 04:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
percent we are potentially impoverishing
 
04:16:45.670 --> 04:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
one parent and the way the guidelines
 
04:16:47.910 --> 04:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
would work is if you could have
 
04:16:50.229 --> 04:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
really disproportionate incomes with one
 
04:16:51.910 --> 04:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
parent versus another
 
04:16:54.070 --> 04:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
and if they've got shared
 
04:16:55.910 --> 04:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
cust shared parenting time where they're
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
with them equally you could have an
 
04:17:00.790 --> 04:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
amount so small that one parent cannot
 
04:17:03.349 --> 04:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
realistically provide an adequate home
 
04:17:04.950 --> 04:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
for the children when you're looking at
 
04:17:07.349 --> 04:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
these kinds of numbers it is the reason
 
04:17:09.429 --> 04:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
that for the last 20 some years we have
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
gone against this and this 115 reserve
 
04:17:15.429 --> 04:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
is consistent with the problems that
 
04:17:15.439 --> 04:17:16.149 align:start position:0%
is consistent with the problems that
have

04:17:16.149 --> 04:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:17:18.950 --> 04:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
evolved over the last 20 years
 
04:17:21.110 --> 04:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
so that's why i'm one of the reasons i'm
 
04:17:23.189 --> 04:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
opposing both the amendment and the bill
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
is i think it's going to particularly at
 
04:17:27.750 --> 04:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
this number of only 115 as opposed to
 
04:17:29.830 --> 04:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
150 percent that the policy committee
 
04:17:29.840 --> 04:17:30.550 align:start position:0%
150 percent that the policy committee
did

04:17:30.550 --> 04:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
did
 
04:17:32.630 --> 04:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
it will result in one parent being
 
04:17:32.640 --> 04:17:34.710 align:start position:0%
it will result in one parent being
impoverished

04:17:34.710 --> 04:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
impoverished
 
04:17:34.720 --> 04:17:35.510 align:start position:0%
impoverished
uh

04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:17:37.030 --> 04:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
i have a question
 
04:17:39.670 --> 04:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
what is current law in this regard
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
the current law is 115
 
04:17:44.550 --> 04:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
okay so we're not
 
04:17:45.670 --> 04:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
we're going
 
04:17:48.950 --> 04:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
all we're doing is saying current law
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
well except that we would freeze it at
 
04:17:54.389 --> 04:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
the current law levels until we had the
 
04:17:56.550 --> 04:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
information from the department to make
 
04:17:58.550 --> 04:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
a judgment about
 
04:17:59.990 --> 04:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not it should be raised and
 
04:18:02.710 --> 04:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
by how much okay thank you but excuse me
 
04:18:04.469 --> 04:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
may i address that
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
i believe current law does not tie
 
04:18:10.469 --> 04:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
support to parenting time the current
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
law ties support to income of each
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
parent not the parenting time and by
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
tying it to parenting time is what's
 
04:18:20.550 --> 04:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
going to result in this impossible of a
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
parent and the 115 percent when that's
 
04:18:24.550 --> 04:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
where what's going to be considered
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
you're going to have some parent where
 
04:18:28.229 --> 04:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to have really not enough
 
04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
money to sustain a household
 
04:18:32.309 --> 04:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:18:32.319 --> 04:18:38.309 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
um

04:18:38.309 --> 04:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
is there anything
 
04:18:42.229 --> 04:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
04:18:45.750 --> 04:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
that deals with co-parenting
 
04:18:47.590 --> 04:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh there is but that's in the main bill
 
04:18:48.870 --> 04:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
and i was trying to stick to the
 
04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
amendment good okay so we'll get to that
 
04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
later all right are there any more
 
04:18:56.870 --> 04:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:59.670 --> 04:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh because my quote was uh i think
 
04:19:02.710 --> 04:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
misquoted i may i come back and and
 
04:19:04.630 --> 04:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
restate what i believe i said and
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
certainly what i i think i meant
 
04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
what i would i yes you may thank thank
 
04:19:10.950 --> 04:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
04:19:14.550 --> 04:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
um the concept of a self-support reserve
 
04:19:16.870 --> 04:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
this isn't my concept it's the concept
 
04:19:18.630 --> 04:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's in law today
 
04:19:21.110 --> 04:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
is that that is the level that an
 
04:19:24.070 --> 04:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
individual would need to have in order
 
04:19:26.469 --> 04:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
to support themselves
 
04:19:27.910 --> 04:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
04:19:30.309 --> 04:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
they can support themselves or not at
 
04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
that level
 
04:19:34.149 --> 04:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
is is not what i'm saying right now i'm
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
just saying that that hundred and
 
04:19:37.030 --> 04:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
fifteen percent
 
04:19:38.710 --> 04:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
is the
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
current laws attempt to shield money for
 
04:19:44.630 --> 04:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
the individual so that they can sustain
 
04:19:44.640 --> 04:19:46.149 align:start position:0%
the individual so that they can sustain
themselves

04:19:46.149 --> 04:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
04:19:48.229 --> 04:19:48.239 align:start position:0%

04:21:56.309 --> 04:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
yes yes ma'am i can comment on it please
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
may i yes okay so um as i mentioned as
 
04:22:01.750 --> 04:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
we were discussing the amendment there
 
04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
are two big components to this bill
 
04:22:06.309 --> 04:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
and we we just dealt with the one that
 
04:22:08.710 --> 04:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
was publicly stated to be the concern
 
04:22:10.389 --> 04:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
that we couldn't get our arms around the
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal numbers so we deferred that
 
04:22:14.790 --> 04:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
what's the big the other big component
 
04:22:16.710 --> 04:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
the other big component
 
04:22:21.510 --> 04:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
is essential because of a 2018 court
 
04:22:21.520 --> 04:22:22.550 align:start position:0%
is essential because of a 2018 court
ruling

04:22:22.550 --> 04:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
ruling
 
04:22:25.110 --> 04:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
that basically said that
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
regardless or independent of
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
the joint custody agreement
 
04:22:34.229 --> 04:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
the person with more money would pay
 
04:22:36.630 --> 04:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
entirely the entire joint custody
 
04:22:38.790 --> 04:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
payment and pay it to
 
04:22:42.790 --> 04:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
the lesser income individual
 
04:22:42.800 --> 04:22:44.149 align:start position:0%
the lesser income individual
this

04:22:44.149 --> 04:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
has caused the courts a great deal of
 
04:22:47.040 --> 04:22:48.229 align:start position:0%
has caused the courts a great deal of
concern

04:22:48.229 --> 04:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:22:48.239 --> 04:22:49.269 align:start position:0%
concern
because

04:22:49.269 --> 04:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:22:49.279 --> 04:22:50.710 align:start position:0%
because
um

04:22:50.710 --> 04:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:54.149 --> 04:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
they they have uh acted a little
 
04:22:56.870 --> 04:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
independently and arbitrary uh between
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
the different judges and they've asked
 
04:23:02.550 --> 04:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
for the legislature to step forward with
 
04:23:04.389 --> 04:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
a formula
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
to weight
 
04:23:09.030 --> 04:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
how much should go
 
04:23:09.040 --> 04:23:10.389 align:start position:0%
how much should go
to

04:23:10.389 --> 04:23:10.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:23:12.630 --> 04:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
into joint custody and what the
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
percentage of sharing is
 
04:23:16.469 --> 04:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
so like if you know
 
04:23:18.309 --> 04:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative earth and i were having
 
04:23:18.319 --> 04:23:19.110 align:start position:0%
representative earth and i were having
this

04:23:19.110 --> 04:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
argument and he had the kid 40 percent
 
04:23:25.349 --> 04:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
of the time and i had the kids 60
 
04:23:29.189 --> 04:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
then there would be a shift in resources
 
04:23:32.550 --> 04:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
to compensate me for that 20 percentage
 
04:23:34.710 --> 04:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
points that's what the formula does is
 
04:23:37.030 --> 04:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
to figure out how much should be
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
balanced in order to keep both parents
 
04:23:43.910 --> 04:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
as whole as they can so so the formula
 
04:23:46.149 --> 04:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
is important because
 
04:23:48.870 --> 04:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
family court is hell on earth
 
04:23:48.880 --> 04:23:49.750 align:start position:0%
family court is hell on earth
and

04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
this fighting over money
 
04:23:54.070 --> 04:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
and who pays how much
 
04:23:56.790 --> 04:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
it has been a mess now for three or four
 
04:24:00.309 --> 04:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
years and this formula will allow the
 
04:24:01.990 --> 04:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
courts to
 
04:24:04.229 --> 04:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh routinely
 
04:24:07.269 --> 04:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
adjudicate the amount of money that
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
should go from one parent to another in
 
04:24:12.229 --> 04:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
a joint parenting environment and for
 
04:24:13.590 --> 04:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
that reason
 
04:24:16.710 --> 04:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
i think it's time sensitive and critical
 
04:24:18.070 --> 04:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
that we pass
 
04:24:19.910 --> 04:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
the component that's based on the
 
04:24:25.110 --> 04:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
formula so i i recommend otpa
 
04:24:27.670 --> 04:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
are there further comments representing
 
04:24:27.680 --> 04:24:29.990 align:start position:0%
are there further comments representing
walls

04:24:29.990 --> 04:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
walls
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
so in the 18 years i've been involved in
 
04:24:35.110 --> 04:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
this this is at least the fourth change
 
04:24:36.149 --> 04:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:24:39.429 --> 04:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
formula for determining child support uh
 
04:24:41.189 --> 04:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
it seems that every couple of years the
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
legislature tries to tinker with it and
 
04:24:45.269 --> 04:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
no matter where they ticker with it
 
04:24:47.590 --> 04:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
there's always somebody that's unhappy
 
04:24:49.030 --> 04:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
and there was obviously somebody that
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
was unhappy this time that brought
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
forward this particular
 
04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
version of it
 
04:24:55.590 --> 04:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
but i maintain that this particular
 
04:24:58.630 --> 04:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
version of it is going to impoverish at
 
04:25:00.630 --> 04:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
least one parent when you've got some
 
04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
real disparity there in income
 
04:25:05.590 --> 04:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
or even when you don't and i am not
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
going to be able to support this given
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
the effect on impoverishing a parent but
 
04:25:12.469 --> 04:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to to
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that the courts have had
 
04:25:16.630 --> 04:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
guidance ever since we went to shared
 
04:25:18.950 --> 04:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
parenting back in 2004
 
04:25:20.710 --> 04:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
there has been consistent guidance we'd
 
04:25:22.710 --> 04:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
keep amending it but there has always
 
04:25:24.309 --> 04:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
been guidance there there has always
 
04:25:26.790 --> 04:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
been some sort of formula some way to do
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
it and the courts have implemented it
 
04:25:29.040 --> 04:25:29.990 align:start position:0%
it and the courts have implemented it
they've

04:25:29.990 --> 04:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
they've
 
04:25:32.309 --> 04:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
amended it as we have amended the law
 
04:25:34.309 --> 04:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
but this is not new guidance this is
 
04:25:36.550 --> 04:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
just the latest change in the guidance
 
04:25:39.510 --> 04:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
as to what's always been there
 
04:25:41.189 --> 04:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further comments
 
04:25:44.149 --> 04:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:46.229 --> 04:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
so i believe
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
there's a couple issues there i i do
 
04:25:51.110 --> 04:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
believe this lawsuit that
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative ed was referred to
 
04:25:54.870 --> 04:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
did change
 
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
the state of things by removing
 
04:25:59.670 --> 04:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
the discretion of judges
 
04:25:59.680 --> 04:26:00.790 align:start position:0%
the discretion of judges
to

04:26:00.790 --> 04:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:26:03.429 --> 04:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
share the
 
04:26:05.670 --> 04:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
cost between households so that's one
 
04:26:05.680 --> 04:26:06.710 align:start position:0%
cost between households so that's one
point

04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:26:07.670 --> 04:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
the and
 
04:26:09.510 --> 04:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
another point is as far as the way this
 
04:26:09.520 --> 04:26:10.790 align:start position:0%
another point is as far as the way this
bill

04:26:10.790 --> 04:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
um what it does first of all it doesn't
 
04:26:15.670 --> 04:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
just take into consideration the
 
04:26:19.110 --> 04:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
household let's call it the less
 
04:26:21.030 --> 04:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
the house go with less income
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
rather it looks at the fact in a
 
04:26:25.429 --> 04:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
co-parenting state so traditionally
 
04:26:27.510 --> 04:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
if if it was not which is what it was
 
04:26:28.950 --> 04:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
many years ago it wasn't really
 
04:26:30.389 --> 04:26:30.399 align:start position:0%
co-parenting the children
 
04:26:32.229 --> 04:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
tended to stay with one
 
04:26:32.239 --> 04:26:33.990 align:start position:0%
tended to stay with one
party

04:26:33.990 --> 04:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
party
 
04:26:35.830 --> 04:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
this looks at it as two separate
 
04:26:37.429 --> 04:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
households so first of all the
 
04:26:39.110 --> 04:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
calculation is
 
04:26:39.120 --> 04:26:40.469 align:start position:0%
calculation is
greater

04:26:40.469 --> 04:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
greater
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
than it would have been previously the
 
04:26:44.469 --> 04:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
the total cost if you will because now
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
you're not talking about one household
 
04:26:47.269 --> 04:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
but two household because the children's
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
going back and forth um so so that's
 
04:26:51.510 --> 04:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's part of it
 
04:26:52.469 --> 04:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
i think addresses the lower income
 
04:26:57.189 --> 04:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
situation that was being described
 
04:27:00.149 --> 04:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
the real concern came
 
04:27:03.269 --> 04:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
from situations where the incomes were
 
04:27:05.510 --> 04:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
more closely aligned
 
04:27:07.510 --> 04:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
so for instance take the case where one
 
04:27:09.510 --> 04:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
party and it could be either party we
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
actually had representatives of both
 
04:27:14.149 --> 04:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the right word to use
 
04:27:16.389 --> 04:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
is anymore
 
04:27:17.590 --> 04:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
we had people with different genders
 
04:27:17.600 --> 04:27:19.269 align:start position:0%
we had people with different genders
there

04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:27:20.630 --> 04:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
talking about this
 
04:27:22.630 --> 04:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
and you could essentially have one one
 
04:27:24.389 --> 04:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
party have a
 
04:27:26.469 --> 04:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
a an income and the other one have an
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
income of that same number plus one
 
04:27:28.479 --> 04:27:29.990 align:start position:0%
income of that same number plus one
dollar

04:27:29.990 --> 04:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
and in that situation
 
04:27:33.590 --> 04:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
a calculation would be made as to what
 
04:27:35.590 --> 04:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
the total
 
04:27:37.830 --> 04:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
shared cost would be
 
04:27:40.389 --> 04:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
between the two households
 
04:27:40.399 --> 04:27:41.590 align:start position:0%
between the two households
but

04:27:41.590 --> 04:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:27:44.070 --> 04:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
all of the income all of the excuse me
 
04:27:47.590 --> 04:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
all of the child care would go to the
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
parent the parent
 
04:27:50.159 --> 04:27:51.189 align:start position:0%
parent the parent
making

04:27:51.189 --> 04:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
making
 
04:27:52.870 --> 04:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
one dollar less
 
04:27:55.990 --> 04:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
so essentially the other parent has no
 
04:27:57.830 --> 04:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
control over
 
04:27:59.429 --> 04:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
what's happening with the child's
 
04:28:02.070 --> 04:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
clothing filter and so on and so forth
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
even though the parents themselves are
 
04:28:06.070 --> 04:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
very closely aligned in terms of
 
04:28:07.349 --> 04:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
their income
 
04:28:09.269 --> 04:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
so that's the goal that that's been
 
04:28:10.870 --> 04:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
trying to be addressed in terms of your
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
share you're sharing the parenting you
 
04:28:14.389 --> 04:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
have two households they might be
 
04:28:15.750 --> 04:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
roughly equally sharing the parenting or
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
maybe it's 40 60 or whatever it doesn't
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
really matter
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
but the point is that the parent the
 
04:28:22.469 --> 04:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
parent with the greater income even
 
04:28:24.389 --> 04:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
though it's only slightly greater should
 
04:28:24.399 --> 04:28:25.189 align:start position:0%
though it's only slightly greater should
have

04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:28:25.199 --> 04:28:26.229 align:start position:0%
have
some

04:28:26.229 --> 04:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:28:26.239 --> 04:28:27.030 align:start position:0%
some
uh

04:28:27.030 --> 04:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:29.269 --> 04:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
money if you will to
 
04:28:31.349 --> 04:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
support the child when that child is
 
04:28:34.469 --> 04:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
with or children uh with that parent
 
04:28:38.550 --> 04:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:40.469 --> 04:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
04:28:41.670 --> 04:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:28:43.590 --> 04:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
sort of a repeat of what i said before
 
04:28:46.469 --> 04:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
but i we are the finance committee and i
 
04:28:48.309 --> 04:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
don't think any of us can walk out of
 
04:28:49.510 --> 04:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
here today
 
04:28:52.149 --> 04:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
feeling really clear about what the cost
 
04:28:55.030 --> 04:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
of this piece of legislation is
 
04:28:55.040 --> 04:28:57.429 align:start position:0%
of this piece of legislation is
it's

04:28:57.429 --> 04:28:57.439 align:start position:0%

going it will have an impact on artanis
 
04:29:00.640 --> 04:29:01.990 align:start position:0%
going it will have an impact on artanis
and

04:29:01.990 --> 04:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
and

food stamp
 
04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
rolls our housing housing subsidies and
 
04:29:08.469 --> 04:29:08.479 align:start position:0%
i think that um it would have been
 
04:29:10.710 --> 04:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
better for us to have found out what
 
04:29:14.149 --> 04:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
those what that impact was before we
 
04:29:16.070 --> 04:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
move forward the policy and the
 
04:29:16.080 --> 04:29:17.590 align:start position:0%
move forward the policy and the
department

04:29:17.590 --> 04:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:29:19.750 --> 04:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
testified in front of us that they are
 
04:29:21.429 --> 04:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
working on that now and we'll have it
 
04:29:25.189 --> 04:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:26.469 --> 04:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:29:29.349 --> 04:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative earth i'd like to speak
 
04:29:33.349 --> 04:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
to that point as well i left that out
 
04:29:35.990 --> 04:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
so the department actually did not yes
 
04:29:37.910 --> 04:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
they are doing a quite quadrennial
 
04:29:39.349 --> 04:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
review of
 
04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
child care support
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
they did not state they were going to be
 
04:29:46.229 --> 04:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
able to address this particular concern
 
04:29:50.389 --> 04:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
the concern here is it has to do with
 
04:29:53.429 --> 04:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
how many people are low income i.e under
 
04:29:55.990 --> 04:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
the care of the state if you will
 
04:29:58.389 --> 04:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
and how many people that would grow by
 
04:30:00.790 --> 04:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
which we eliminated with the amendment
 
04:30:02.790 --> 04:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
that we just passed because we're not
 
04:30:05.110 --> 04:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
changing the 150 percent threshold
 
04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
whereas if we did change that that would
 
04:30:08.389 --> 04:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
grow that as well so there's a lot of
 
04:30:11.189 --> 04:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
variability here that
 
04:30:12.950 --> 04:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
cannot be readily determined under any
 
04:30:15.030 --> 04:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances until
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
the the process until it actually
 
04:30:16.560 --> 04:30:17.910 align:start position:0%
the the process until it actually
implemented

04:30:17.910 --> 04:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
04:30:17.920 --> 04:30:18.870 align:start position:0%
implemented
and

04:30:18.870 --> 04:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
04:30:22.469 --> 04:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
this had this the situation has been
 
04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
studied heavily for the past i believe
 
04:30:26.790 --> 04:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
it's four years i think it was in 2018
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
if i'm not mistaken before i was here
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh bill passed
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars was allocated to
 
04:30:35.510 --> 04:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
do a thing called the casey study
 
04:30:38.070 --> 04:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
which study was completed a year or so
 
04:30:38.080 --> 04:30:39.269 align:start position:0%
which study was completed a year or so
later

04:30:39.269 --> 04:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
later
 
04:30:40.710 --> 04:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
and there have been a few studies in
 
04:30:42.469 --> 04:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
between of less
 
04:30:42.479 --> 04:30:43.429 align:start position:0%
between of less
cost

04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
cost
 
04:30:45.510 --> 04:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
so there's no question that this process
 
04:30:47.910 --> 04:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
has been studied and at this point it
 
04:30:50.550 --> 04:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
seems what we need to do is implement it
 
04:30:53.590 --> 04:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:55.750 --> 04:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
04:30:58.550 --> 04:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
much has been made of the fact that 115
 
04:31:01.110 --> 04:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
percent hasn't been increased in 30
 
04:31:01.120 --> 04:31:02.309 align:start position:0%
percent hasn't been increased in 30
years

04:31:02.309 --> 04:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:31:02.319 --> 04:31:03.110 align:start position:0%
years
but

04:31:03.110 --> 04:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
that's 115 of federal poverty level
 
04:31:10.229 --> 04:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
that increases annually or even more so
 
04:31:12.630 --> 04:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
so it's not like the same number has
 
04:31:15.189 --> 04:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
been fixed for 30 years and somebody
 
04:31:16.870 --> 04:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
tried to give us that impression thank
 
04:31:16.880 --> 04:31:18.309 align:start position:0%

madam chair i i i move otp and then
 
04:33:11.510 --> 04:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
would like to subsequently make it otpa
 
04:33:13.830 --> 04:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
no the it shows here that there was an
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:18.480 --> 04:33:19.830 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:33:19.830 --> 04:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:33:21.429 --> 04:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
i the amendment
 
04:33:23.590 --> 04:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
that i'm prepared to talk to i think is
 
04:33:24.949 --> 04:33:24.959 align:start position:0%
new is
 
04:33:27.269 --> 04:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
mr ripple here
 
04:33:30.629 --> 04:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
this this amendment did not come over
 
04:33:33.830 --> 04:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
from the policy committee if i may go
 
04:33:36.310 --> 04:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
yeah somebody should you may recall
 
04:33:39.269 --> 04:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
president edwards i believe the
 
04:33:41.269 --> 04:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
part one part roman numeral part i i
 
04:33:42.709 --> 04:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
believe you did have you did put forth
 
04:33:44.551 --> 04:33:44.561 align:start position:0%
that amendment
 
04:33:46.789 --> 04:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
and then you added the
 
04:33:50.150 --> 04:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
other part or either that or vice versa
 
04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
so i believe there's actually you and i
 
04:33:52.949 --> 04:33:52.959 align:start position:0%
i think have actually seen several
 
04:33:54.869 --> 04:33:54.879 align:start position:0%
amendments on this
 
04:33:58.310 --> 04:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding 1134 is the most
 
04:34:01.189 --> 04:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
recent and and got voted out of our
 
04:34:03.029 --> 04:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
committee but not in front of the full
 
04:34:03.039 --> 04:34:04.551 align:start position:0%
committee but not in front of the full
committee

04:34:04.551 --> 04:34:04.561 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:34:06.551 --> 04:34:06.561 align:start position:0%
right and that's the amendment where i'm
 
04:34:10.470 --> 04:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
asking for a motion on is 11 34.
 
04:34:13.189 --> 04:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
okay i'll i'll move 1134. i just thought
 
04:34:15.510 --> 04:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
we needed to have an underlying otp no
 
04:34:17.830 --> 04:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
because it's already on here as
 
04:34:20.629 --> 04:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
amendment as amended all right so do i
 
04:34:23.269 --> 04:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
have a second second thank you reps and
 
04:34:23.279 --> 04:34:25.750 align:start position:0%

04:35:08.789 --> 04:35:08.799 align:start position:0%
fluent in what the privacy rules and
 
04:35:11.029 --> 04:35:11.039 align:start position:0%
principles are and they should be pretty
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
fluent on i.t security issues so in
 
04:35:16.949 --> 04:35:16.959 align:start position:0%
previous versions of this bill
 
04:35:19.189 --> 04:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
we weren't certain what the grade level
 
04:35:21.510 --> 04:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
for those skills are
 
04:35:23.269 --> 04:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
but they turn out to be
 
04:35:25.109 --> 04:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
labor grade 30
 
04:35:27.830 --> 04:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
step five based on the analysis the
 
04:35:30.551 --> 04:35:30.561 align:start position:0%
department did with whoever does the hr
 
04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
04:35:35.349 --> 04:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
um and so so they need two people
 
04:35:37.750 --> 04:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
so the main reason finance dealt with
 
04:35:40.230 --> 04:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
this is to get the money right and and
 
04:35:43.990 --> 04:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment gets the the money right
 
04:35:47.189 --> 04:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
the um the other thing that we did
 
04:35:47.199 --> 04:35:48.230 align:start position:0%
the um the other thing that we did
which

04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:35:50.789 --> 04:35:50.799 align:start position:0%
delved just a tiny bit into the policy
 
04:35:50.799 --> 04:35:51.670 align:start position:0%
delved just a tiny bit into the policy
side

04:35:51.670 --> 04:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
side
 
04:35:54.551 --> 04:35:54.561 align:start position:0%
was there was some ambiguity in the main
 
04:35:57.269 --> 04:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
04:36:00.150 --> 04:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
one of these privacy risk plans needs to
 
04:36:02.949 --> 04:36:02.959 align:start position:0%
be done for each it system
 
04:36:04.709 --> 04:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
the way it read somebody could
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
misinterpret it to mean one risk
 
04:36:09.590 --> 04:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
medication strategy for all the it
 
04:36:12.390 --> 04:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
systems so so we
 
04:36:14.709 --> 04:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
we clarified that in there because it
 
04:36:16.789 --> 04:36:16.799 align:start position:0%
that directly affects workload which can
 
04:36:19.670 --> 04:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
affect manpower needs so
 
04:36:21.750 --> 04:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
so it does those two things it corrects
 
04:36:23.750 --> 04:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
the labor grade and the money that goes
 
04:36:27.109 --> 04:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
with it and then it clarifies that uh
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
one of these risk mitigation plans is
 
04:36:32.709 --> 04:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
needed for each it system that
 
04:36:34.949 --> 04:36:34.959 align:start position:0%
processes personal data
 
04:36:36.949 --> 04:36:36.959 align:start position:0%
thank you i would ask you to accept it
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chairman my question is

there's a
 
04:36:49.189 --> 04:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh a shortage of there's a large number

of vacancies throughout the state
 
04:36:53.830 --> 04:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
did the department come forth and say
 
04:36:55.990 --> 04:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
that they had identified people for this
 
04:36:57.990 --> 04:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
position or were just appropriating
 
04:37:00.310 --> 04:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
funds for
 
04:37:02.709 --> 04:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
an empty slot
 
04:37:04.629 --> 04:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
okay that's a good question just a
 
04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
moment please
 
04:37:08.629 --> 04:37:08.639 align:start position:0%

uh thank you madam chair uh that that's
 
04:37:13.670 --> 04:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
a good question and i i tried to address
 
04:37:15.750 --> 04:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
that earlier when i said these are
 
04:37:18.869 --> 04:37:18.879 align:start position:0%
unique skills finding people that are
 
04:37:21.349 --> 04:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
fluent in privacy rules and principles
 
04:37:22.629 --> 04:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
who are also
 
04:37:25.109 --> 04:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
really very aware of i.t security the
 
04:37:27.670 --> 04:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
department doesn't have those nor does
 
04:37:30.310 --> 04:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
the doit who
 
04:37:33.109 --> 04:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
worked with us extensively he likes this
 
04:37:35.750 --> 04:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill so much he wants a bill like this
 
04:37:37.750 --> 04:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
to do the department of i.t in the
 
04:37:39.590 --> 04:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
coming year so
 
04:37:42.551 --> 04:37:42.561 align:start position:0%
so this these are these are new skills
 
04:37:44.629 --> 04:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
and therefore new job descriptions and
 
04:37:46.709 --> 04:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
therefore new positions
 
04:37:48.310 --> 04:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
um and you're right there's a huge
 
04:37:50.709 --> 04:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate so they could maybe cover
 
04:37:53.750 --> 04:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
it with their um i want to call it float
 
04:37:56.629 --> 04:37:56.639 align:start position:0%

22
 
04:44:55.110 --> 04:44:55.120 align:start position:0%

did you want to speak to your amendment
 
04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
uh please um
 
04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
so i think maybe it was representative
 
04:45:23.750 --> 04:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
mooney who who caught it first in the
 
04:45:25.910 --> 04:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
committee that
 
04:45:25.920 --> 04:45:27.350 align:start position:0%
committee that
the

04:45:27.350 --> 04:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:45:27.360 --> 04:45:28.868 align:start position:0%
the
statement

04:45:28.868 --> 04:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
statement
 
04:45:31.030 --> 04:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
that excuses or
 
04:45:34.230 --> 04:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
allows for an abortion after 24 weeks in
 
04:45:36.550 --> 04:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
the case of fetal abnormalities
 
04:45:38.868 --> 04:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life
 
04:45:38.878 --> 04:45:39.670 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life
that

04:45:39.670 --> 04:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:45:40.868 --> 04:45:40.878 align:start position:0%
that that
 
04:45:44.310 --> 04:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
we had used that phrase twice once in
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph 1 starting on line 10 and then
 
04:45:51.590 --> 04:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
a second time which is now line 23
 
04:45:52.708 --> 04:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:45:54.788 --> 04:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
to clarify the law
 
04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
after a sidebar
 
04:45:59.590 --> 04:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
we decided that the best thing to do is
 
04:46:01.750 --> 04:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
was to delete that reference from line
 
04:46:04.150 --> 04:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
10 and so now it's gone
 
04:46:06.310 --> 04:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
because that would have conflicted with
 
04:46:07.270 --> 04:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
04:46:09.590 --> 04:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
requirement of the ultrasound
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
um and then keep it in line 23.
 
04:46:15.670 --> 04:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
the rest of the amendment just clarifies
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
the existing statute as already in law
 
04:46:21.590 --> 04:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
that that that this paragraph shall be
 
04:46:23.750 --> 04:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
construed to require the performance of
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
an ultrasound
 
04:46:27.510 --> 04:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
only if the provider either knows that
 
04:46:29.750 --> 04:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
the fetus has just stationed a just
 
04:46:33.030 --> 04:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
additional age of at least 24 weeks or
 
04:46:35.350 --> 04:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
is conscious of a substantial risk that
 
04:46:38.470 --> 04:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
the fetal has a just additional age of
 
04:46:40.390 --> 04:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
at least 24 weeks
 
04:46:40.400 --> 04:46:41.190 align:start position:0%
at least 24 weeks
so

04:46:41.190 --> 04:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:43.030 --> 04:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
so this means
 
04:46:43.040 --> 04:46:44.390 align:start position:0%
so this means
doctors

04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
04:46:46.788 --> 04:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
won't get penalized and i won't use the
 
04:46:48.788 --> 04:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
mens rear quote because i'm not exactly
 
04:46:51.270 --> 04:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
sure what that means
 
04:46:55.750 --> 04:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh are there any other comments
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:05.590 --> 04:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
i continue to be concerned that we have
 
04:47:05.600 --> 04:47:07.910 align:start position:0%
i continue to be concerned that we have
um

04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:10.150 --> 04:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
put our finger on
 
04:47:10.160 --> 04:47:11.270 align:start position:0%
put our finger on
policy

04:47:11.270 --> 04:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
policy
 
04:47:13.990 --> 04:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
and that we have not that we are
 
04:47:16.150 --> 04:47:16.160 align:start position:0%
changing the bill substantially from how
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
it came to us from health and human
 
04:47:18.240 --> 04:47:20.070 align:start position:0%
it came to us from health and human
services

04:47:20.070 --> 04:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:47:23.910 --> 04:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment before you
 
04:47:26.628 --> 04:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with finances
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
and it is strictly a policy it's
 
04:47:30.948 --> 04:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
strictly policy
 
04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
and for that reason i i will vote no to
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
04:47:38.470 --> 04:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments
 
04:47:41.270 --> 04:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
represent turkup thank you madam chair
 
04:47:43.030 --> 04:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
um although i
 
04:47:45.590 --> 04:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
am not a big proponent of this amendment
 
04:47:48.550 --> 04:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
i will support it um only because it's
 
04:47:51.750 --> 04:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
not quite as obnoxious as 1609 was by
 
04:47:54.310 --> 04:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
itself which should have been itl
 
04:47:57.510 --> 04:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
i will support this as a a way of moving
 
04:48:00.708 --> 04:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh 1609 forward however thank you thank
 
04:48:03.750 --> 04:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
you any any other comments represent
 
04:48:07.110 --> 04:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
edwards uh if if i could i i would say
 
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
that when we um
 
04:48:13.350 --> 04:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
provide the mother the option of having
 
04:48:15.110 --> 04:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
an abortion in the case of fetal

empowers her and her physician to

exercise an option that isn't in current
 
04:48:28.390 --> 04:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
law and would therefore also

back them away

have come into play so if we're looking
 
04:48:38.628 --> 04:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
for a financial tie it could be
 
04:48:38.638 --> 04:48:39.670 align:start position:0%
