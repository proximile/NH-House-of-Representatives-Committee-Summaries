um as uh we we asked for um a
 
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this because there was a
 
00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
a great deal of
 
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
um conversation related to the purpose
 
00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 align:start position:0%
of this bill why it had come
 
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
forward um and
 
00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
um and there was not a clear
 
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
committee so we decided to form a
 
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um and this is the
 
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.950 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um and this is the
subcommittee

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
the information that we have received
 
00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
from a number of people um including by
 
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
the way the chair of the education
 
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 align:start position:0%
committee the house of Education
 
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
committee is that um
 
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh given the New Hampshire code of
 
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
ethics and code of conduct for
 
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
educational professionals and other um
 
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
realities that exist in uh state law and
 
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
regulation um there were some questions
 
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
about the appropriateness of this bill
 
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
um in addition the chairman of the
 
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee has um filed um with
 
00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
the office of legislative Services um uh
 
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
a legislative service request for a
 
00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
bill dealing somewhat with what I guess
 
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
called the non gerain
 
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that had been proposed to this
 
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
and um how that will
 
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
proceed I don't I don't know um but what
 
00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
we have before us is the bill
 
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
itself um there had been extensive um
 
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
testimony on it uh and um I guess what
 
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do now is unless the
 
00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 align:start position:0%
committee members have another
 
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
suggestion is I would like to ask if
 
00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
there is anybody present who would like
 
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
to share with us um their views on this
 
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if we want
 
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.270 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if we want
the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 align:start position:0%
um well let's see do you want to say
 
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
something we just here to listen right
 
00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:32.439 align:start position:0%
now okay okay at any time that you want
 
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
to say anything we of course would love
 
00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
to hear from you but you know there's no
 
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
pressure okay so is there anybody else
 
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
to does anyone on the committee need to
 
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
have any further clarification have any
 
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
discussion that they would like to have
 
00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:09.470 align:start position:0%
discussion that they would like to have
on

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
um my choice would be to hear from you
 
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
not hearing from you I would put an idea
 
00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
on the on the table with the hope that
 
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
share your views with me um or with
 
00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
um I believe the bill was proposed under
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances a lot of that has
 
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 align:start position:0%
changed we have
 
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.270 align:start position:0%
changed we have
[Music]

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
um I can I personally right now cannot
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
see any reason to go ahead with this
 
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
bill and I do know that representative
 
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
cutab who cannot be here today because
 
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
of the illness of a
 
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
child um has indicated that while she's
 
00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 align:start position:0%
always receptive to hearing new
 
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
information what she knows at this point
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
and she's I say this because she's Vice
 
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 align:start position:0%
chair of this subcommittee um is that
 
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
she too would favor um an itl on this
 
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.990 align:start position:0%
she too would favor um an itl on this
bill

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh and so my question now to my two
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues is is this
 
00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
something is this a bill you want to
 
00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 align:start position:0%
proceed with in this form or an amended
 
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
form or do you believe that there might
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
be other avenues to address this matter
 
00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
representative trip do you have any
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.550 align:start position:0%
 
subject

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 align:start position:0%
um I know the inv for the Department
 
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
could you turn on your mic please and
 
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
speakers yeah although there not many
 
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
people here there might be people
 
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
listening I know that uh I know the uh
 
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
the uh the investigator for the uh
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Education he did uh say
 
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
that uh there were numerous instances
 
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.189 align:start position:0%
that uh there were numerous instances
where

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh the district after completing a uh
 
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
investigation uh the uh Department had
 
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
determined that there was a cause to uh
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
to a follow-up
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
investigation and uh he uh he said that
 
00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 align:start position:0%
there was instances I don't know where
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
numerous or whatever but uh where the uh
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
the uh districts
 
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0%
were hesitent to uh
 
00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
provide details of the in in
 
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
investigation that they had conducted
 
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759 align:start position:0%
uh he was he was therefore unable to
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
know whether there was cause to go
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
forward with the uh disciplinary action
 
00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 align:start position:0%
uh that would justify you know the the
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
request well to
 
00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:33.749 align:start position:0%
request well to
uh

00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
provide uh additional powers to the uh
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Education like other
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
departments have you know which is which
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
would be the subpoena power so that uh
 
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
they could they could do a complete
 
00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:51.070 align:start position:0%
they could they could do a complete
investigation

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh I understand that
 
00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
uh without the subpoena power they're
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
pretty much just
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh left with the results of the district
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh I was interested in uh the uh the
 
00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
department getting the subpoena power so
 
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
on once again if you you can't complete
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
an investigation then uh you don't
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
what what happened you know
 
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.550 align:start position:0%
what what happened you know
the

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
uh so it's it's interesting I I have a
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
somewhat different recollection of of
 
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
what was said and um and which is why
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
I'm very glad you're here and saying
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
what you're saying because my my
 
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
recollection was somewhat different and
 
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
that a couple in a couple of ways that
 
00:08:58.590 --> 00:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
um of course the Attorney General does
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
have the power power
 
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
um to subet in in
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate cases but what I heard him
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
say is that by and large he had been
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
doing his work for a significant number
 
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
of years and has been able to do it um
 
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
with no um with no difficulty there
 
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
might be in a case here or there some
 
00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
resistance but he's been able to do all
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
his work and that he saw this as
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
something that might have that might
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
have value in the
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
future but wasn't
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily um needed now and
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
wonder where we got our
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
differences our different conclusions
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
from because I know you're a very
 
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
careful listener well I believe I
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
believe that the gentleman's name is
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
Richard frell
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
and uh he said he was the
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire Department education
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
investigator uh he' received push back
 
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
by school districts and information
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
request uh he said when he went into
 
00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:18.519 align:start position:0%
look at the
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
U the records that they had uh taken
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
during their investigation he was not
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to make any
 
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.030 align:start position:0%
allowed to make any
copies

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
copies
 
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.269 align:start position:0%
copies
uh

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
he's that
 
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
uh and that uh I
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
believe he says in in 55 cases uh 10 of
 
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
those he got pushed back on and that was
 
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
for I believe this year from January to
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
June so it seemed that
 
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.509 align:start position:0%
June so it seemed that
there's

00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:53.870 align:start position:0%
there's
not

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
well 20% of cases getting pushed back is
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
sign significant in my mind yeah I think
 
00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:06.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
uh and he did he did mention that that
 
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General is is authorized to
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
seek you
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
know information they do have subpena
 
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
uh it's I I found it interesting that uh
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
in going through this the
 
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.030 align:start position:0%
 
me

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's the it's the schools that
 
00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
do the initial investigation and
 
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:47.720 align:start position:0%
uh I
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
believe the original bill was
 
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
uh was would give the uh people who
 
00:11:59.110 --> 00:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
initiated the request for investigation
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
to uh bypass the schools so that the uh
 
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Education can do that is
 
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.910 align:start position:0%
Department of Education can do that is
that

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
correct well the original Bill all the
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
original Bill did if I'm
 
00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.310 align:start position:0%
original Bill did if I'm
correct

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
and was to
 
00:12:25.949 --> 00:12:25.959 align:start position:0%
say um inserting into uh the um a new
 
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph on public school human rights
 
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.629 align:start position:0%
paragraph on public school human rights
complaints

00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education May file a
 
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
complaint on the behalf of a person
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
aggrieved by a discriminatory practice
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
by a school or School District it shall
 
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
apply to any retaliation or
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
discrimination against any person on
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
whose behalf a complaint has been filed
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
by the department that was the original
 
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.389 --> 00:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
then would you like to explain what
 
00:12:59.189 --> 00:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
happened next why don't you do that that
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
expert those are dangerous words well no
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
it's someone who whose judgment is
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
important in this yes thank you uh good
 
00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:16.519 align:start position:0%
morning or good afternoon everyone uh my
 
00:13:18.509 --> 00:13:18.519 align:start position:0%
name is Anie Malachi I'm the executive
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
director for the Human Rights Commission
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
um and so yes it got a little squishy
 
00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
right so the original bill which is HB
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
533 was the intent of that bill um that
 
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli cordelli is the
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of was to add uh a section
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
into RSA
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
354a which is the human rights
 
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
commission's statute to allow the
 
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Education to file a
 
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
charge on behalf of an
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
individual as the conversation continued
 
00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
um during the initial hearing of HB 53
 
00:14:03.389 --> 00:14:03.399 align:start position:0%
three if if I remember correctly um two
 
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
people from the Department of Education
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
I believe Diana Fenton and possibly rich
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
and I can't remember his last name the
 
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
investigator gave testimony and
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
discussed what issues he was having in
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
subpoena in in uh being able to retrieve
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
files for his investigations and I
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
believe that conversation is what uh
 
00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
created the reason for representative
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
2023-24 a but it is focused in RSA 21
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
and it talks about subpoena power
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
relative to the investigations that
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education needs to um
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
engage Eng in when they're doing their
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
investigations um and so 533 is very
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
different from the
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
amendment there was a lot happening in
 
00:15:11.519 --> 00:15:14.189 align:start position:0%
amendment there was a lot happening in
the

00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you I think that helps
 
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
to clarify the understanding of what's
 
00:15:22.829 --> 00:15:22.839 align:start position:0%
going on and so we have the initial
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
bill that says one
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment which as I of course I have
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
not seen the LSR but as I understand it
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
um it is an
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
attempt to address the issue that um Dr
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
Malachi now
 
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.509 align:start position:0%
Malachi now
uh

00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:53.749 align:start position:0%
uh
identified

00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:08.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
533 as um being an
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
orphan and I mean I think we should take
 
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
care of Orphans and widows but that
 
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.629 --> 00:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
them representative L good to see you
 
00:16:27.639 --> 00:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
them representative L good to see you
yeah

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'd like to say just that
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
um you know after listening to um all
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
the testimony that was given especially
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
um the first day that we um heard it um
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
many representatives from or many not
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives pardon me many people um
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
who had um knowledge of Education who
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
had been teachers or were current
 
00:16:59.309 --> 00:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
teachers um all had a lot of concern s
 
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:03.640 align:start position:0%
um over this U becoming
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
um not I don't want to say but could be
 
00:17:07.919 --> 00:17:09.189 align:start position:0%
um not I don't want to say but could be
politically

00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
politically
 
00:17:13.029 --> 00:17:13.039 align:start position:0%
motivated and um but um the thing is is
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
I feel that um after listening
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
to um what uh Richard frell
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
said and you know there was question
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
about um the
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
teachers teacher not being um you know a
 
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of of them not being um
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate and not being good teachers
 
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
and um and I felt like
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
that um you know he was questioned a
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
couple times and then came back and he
 
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
still I mean he didn't come back that
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
day but a representative who had been U
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
president in the room said oh yes well
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
this is what he said on the
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
outside um I just feel that again by
 
00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
giving him the subpoena power I don't
 
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
think that's the right thing I really
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
feel um because I actually had a lot of
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
questions myself and I actually went to
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
our um um our own ad Miss uh our Miss
 
00:18:18.789 --> 00:18:18.799 align:start position:0%
superintendent of education and for I
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
live in Goffstown and just to make sure
 
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding everything and so um
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
so I felt you know there are a lot of
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
people that do get that uh subpoena
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
power um throughout the state you know
 
00:18:33.919 --> 00:18:35.630 align:start position:0%
power um throughout the state you know
but

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
um within this I felt that he was
 
00:18:42.149 --> 00:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
adequately able to
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
get um if there if there was cases that
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
came up he would be able to be provided
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
and he could sit down and
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
review any kind of case if he needed to
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
Richard frell but I don't feel that he
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
needed to U make a copy of all of those
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
um things and I again I even asked you
 
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
know is this the process that you go
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
through and um when a a teacher um or a
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
student or a parent brings this forward
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
and and they said yes but it's it's done
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
um in a fairly Manner and this is you
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
know what we do and um and it's not done
 
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
um not done often but it does occur
 
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
occasionally but at the same time I just
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
felt that um with hearing so much
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
testimony against against this and and
 
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
what it was initially brought as a human
 
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
rights complaint and then all of a
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
sudden this was kind of slid in I'm new
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
but I felt that this was not
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate and and um and also I felt
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
that um the Attorney General's office
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
um oversees this and also um it I mean
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
the um the commissioner of Education can
 
00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:18.919 align:start position:0%
speak to them and that's how that's how
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
it has to be I don't feel that we um
 
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
should have do this you know to give him
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
that that um right to all of a sudden
 
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
have that subpoena privilege um I don't
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
feel that's the right thing to
 
00:20:37.149 --> 00:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
do and uh there's just something about
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
it that doesn't feel right by for me and
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
um so I would
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
um agree with
 
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
um pardon me Marjorie um I would um
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
agree with her to itl this I don't feel
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
that this needs to be um some way or
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
another it just doesn't feel right and I
 
00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:17.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
ited thank you very much uh Madam chair
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
for the record Brian Hawkins Nea New
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we testified uh on both the
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
original Bill 533 as well as the the uh
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
non-gain Amendment um and um I think to
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
what was mentioned earlier um there is
 
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
going to be a discussion in the upcoming
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
session around the merits of whether the
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education ought to have
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
subpoena power uh I saw the LSR title
 
00:21:51.789 --> 00:21:51.799 align:start position:0%
from representative uh
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
Lynn um but this is a very different
 
00:21:56.909 --> 00:21:56.919 align:start position:0%
bill that as you said you have before
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
you uh with respect to Bringing uh human
 
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
rights complaints uh and
 
00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
so uh I think when it comes time for the
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
hearing on whatever bill number is going
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
to be assigned to representative lind's
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
bill we can have the debate on the
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
merits of of whether the department
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
should have subpoena power Andor any
 
00:22:24.029 --> 00:22:24.039 align:start position:0%
kind of um guard rails that may be
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
associated with that but I think the
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
vehicle you have before you is a very
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
different matter and and that was one
 
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
that obviously we opposed during the
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
session so those would be the only
 
00:22:36.669 --> 00:22:36.679 align:start position:0%
comments I would add right
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
now thank you
 
00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much is anybody have
 
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.710 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much is anybody have
any

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative I'm not
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative I'm
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
sorry um chair Matt Malachi could I ask
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
you another question if we were to
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.909 align:start position:0%
you another question if we were to
pass

00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
533 as it is
 
00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:07.400 align:start position:0%
written um do you have the
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
capacity to handle all any complaints
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
that would come from that um thank you
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
for the question um
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
the the it it's not so much in terms of
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
capacity but this would be an
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
unprecedented power given to another
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
agency So currently uh the only agency
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
that could file a charge with the
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
commission would be the Attorney
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
General's office so this would be giving
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
equal status to the Department of
 
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
Education with the Department of Justice
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
in this particular matter um the other
 
00:23:44.669 --> 00:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
element is for us when someone files a
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
charge it's not an anonymous charge
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
someone has to come in and whether it's
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
phone or however but there's a person
 
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
associated with the charge so um I
 
00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
believe um attor Assistant Attorney
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
General lock went into additional
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
definitions or explanations I should say
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of well what happens next so if
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
this is an anonymous charge and the
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is bringing this
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
charge how who is attached to it who's
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
representing that person does the
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Education become their
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
attorney their spokesperson um when do
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
we who are we investigating what what
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
are we investigating on behalf of this
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
particular individual um and so there
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
were a lot of issues that uh this uh
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
that HB 533 would bring to the Forefront
 
00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:40.039 align:start position:0%
which would be very complicated and um
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
if it means that if the Department of
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
Education has a has a complaint or
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
something they should be sending folks
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
to the commission to actually file the
 
00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
complaint um if there are any additional
 
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
issues then certainly between our
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
attorney in the civil Bureau of the doj
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
and the department of education's
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
attorney I'm certain that those two
 
00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
entities could have conversations to
 
00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
figure something out without giving this
 
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinary power and so it makes it
 
00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
very difficult for us to ascertain um
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
who we would be interviewing when the
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
charge is taken um who is attached to
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
the charge how do we go forward with
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
providing um evidence G who are we
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
Gathering evidence from so it's not as
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
simple as just giving us some
 
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
information and we go on our way there
 
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
has to be a person that's attached to it
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
so those are the issues that become very
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
difficult If This Were to
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
you well I want to I want to apologize
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
for uh uh conflating The subpoena
 
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment with the original bill because
 
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
uh it does change it
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
entirely the um and and I remember that
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
uh uh part of the rationale for the uh
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
for the bill when given by uh
 
00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:11.320 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli was that uh you
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
know the the uh as as you said the the
 
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
people that were uh asking for you know
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
the ability of the Department of
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
Education to uh file the
 
00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
uh grievance is that it you know uh
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to be doing it
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
anonymously so it's
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh it's one of these things that it's
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
complicated uh but just because it's
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
complicated doesn't mean that you know
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
something shouldn't be done about it U
 
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
you know because if the if the student
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh taken care of properly you know and
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:12.039 align:start position:0%
not properly take appropriate action
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
take appro appropriate action you know
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
then uh it it seems that there should be
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
a a means for students you know
 
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0%
who that they shouldn't have to suffer
 
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
through you know the schools doing
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
whatever it is are doing that you know
 
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
anyhow can't find the words no I mean
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
we're all you know we're all on This
 
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
Together We want to do the best the best
 
00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:51.799 align:start position:0%
that can be done for uh the children in
 
00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
this state y we certainly want to make
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
sure that the that the school system is
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
focused on meeting the children's needs
 
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that the teachers
 
00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:04.519 align:start position:0%
are focused on meeting the children's
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
needs no one disagrees with that um how
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
you go about doing
 
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.389 --> 00:28:21.399 align:start position:0%
and just
 
00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:25.720 align:start position:0%
having the department be able to to drop
 
00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:29.559 align:start position:0%
a complaint on the desk at human
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
relations commission and expect them to
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
go and solve these the complicated
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
problems of public education doesn't
 
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
make any sense so in terms of I don't
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
think anybody thinks it makes any sense
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of the bill original
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
bill it's one thing in terms of the
 
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.070 align:start position:0%
bill it's one thing in terms of the
proposed

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.750 align:start position:0%
proposed
amendment

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:28:56.909 --> 00:28:56.919 align:start position:0%
um I think that by chairman Lynn going
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
ahead and filing an
 
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
LSR he himself was
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
sending a
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
signal that a better way to handle this
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is to have um which everyone
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
agreed was a non-gain Amendment which is
 
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:20.240 align:start position:0%
why we had to have the hearing in the
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
first place was to have
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
um a new bill come in a hearing discuss
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
it if we were to decide to itl the bill
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
I think we would have to want to make
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
sure that in our
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
um report I almost said blur but I
 
00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:50.799 align:start position:0%
didn't in our report
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
um we make clear that in no way are we
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
minimizing the importance of meeting the
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
needs of children
 
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
if we took that approach are you
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that representative yes
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's one of these things where uh I I
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
agree that the the the current bill is
 
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh is inadequate it doesn't
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh provide the relief
 
00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:19.240 align:start position:0%
that that I I believe representative
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
Celli thought it did and and it wasn't
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know the proper vehicle for
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh some soling this problem you know so
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
I I agree with you if if there's a if we
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
can provide a recommendation that says
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
that uh you know yes there is a problem
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
but uh we believe that this is not the
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
solution and that uh you
 
00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:48.039 align:start position:0%
know a better solution is being recom is
 
00:30:48.039 --> 00:30:49.509 align:start position:0%
know a better solution is being recom is
being

00:30:49.509 --> 00:30:49.519 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
developed well technically speaking we
 
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
do have a quarum because there are three
 
00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
of us here out of the five on uh uh who
 
00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:00.919 align:start position:0%
are on our subcommittee because it's
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
couta Paige Lan trip and me but because
 
00:31:07.629 --> 00:31:07.639 align:start position:0%
there are only
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
three what I would like to suggest if
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
and if the two of you agree is that we
 
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
don't take a vote but instead
 
00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.950 align:start position:0%
don't take a vote but instead
say

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
summarize our our conclusions and then
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
ask the committee to
 
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
vote that's a great idea is that okay
 
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
yes I I just and with just three of us I
 
00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.269 align:start position:0%
yes I I just and with just three of us I
I

00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
feel a little hesitant to take a formal
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
vote and put that kind of pressure on
 
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
the full
 
00:31:46.269 --> 00:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
committee um you
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
know but um if that's okay with you so
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
that would mean when we come back on the
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
eth um in our work
 
00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:57.799 align:start position:0%
session we would have a chance then
 
00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:01.039 align:start position:0%
present to the committee why we are
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
making this suggestion that we're making
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
rather than presenting a mo a formal
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
motion no is that okay suggestion
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation same thing well it except
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
somehow if we went in with a vote they
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
would have to accept or reject the vote
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
and I just i' like to have a bigger yeah
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
a bigger group yeah but
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
do you have another suggestion yeah you
 
00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
have a different suggestion no I don't
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
okay so you're okay with that
 
00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
representative Smith could I add
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
something you'd like um to to answer
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
your question representative um you were
 
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
your concern was for students who may
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
have an issue of discrimination and them
 
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not they were able to come
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
to the commission and and that was the
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
concern um the way the law is stated
 
00:33:00.029 --> 00:33:00.039 align:start position:0%
right now they can and if retaliation is
 
00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
something that they that the student or
 
00:33:03.909 --> 00:33:03.919 align:start position:0%
the parent is concerned about um
 
00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
retaliation is already in our statute
 
00:33:08.509 --> 00:33:08.519 align:start position:0%
and that is against the law now do
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
people follow the law that's a really
 
00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519 align:start position:0%
good question but if there's some form
 
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
of retaliation that that student is
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
facing that can be added to the charge
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
and we can do that investigation to
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
Encompass all of that so this particular
 
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
Bill all it does is take the take the um
 
00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
ability that that is already present for
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
a student or their parent or Guardian to
 
00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
file a charge and add it to the
 
00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Education specifically the
 
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
commissioner um it still doesn't answer
 
00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
the question of well who is the person
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
filing the charge if the Department of
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
Education is filing it who are they
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
filing it on behalf of if that person
 
00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
wants to be anonymous we have nothing to
 
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
investigate because we don't have a
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
person to interview and Witnesses Etc um
 
00:33:59.470 --> 00:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
so it's just like if you go to the
 
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
police station you could let the police
 
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
know that something happened but if
 
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
you're not willing to to sign some sort
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
of affidavit saying you witnessed it
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
then there's not they they're put on
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
notice but there's not much they can do
 
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:13.720 align:start position:0%
so that's where it gets a little weird
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
um and represent representative Smith
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
you asked about um charges I think so in
 
00:34:21.629 --> 00:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
2019 when K through2 public education
 
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
was added a wild guess here I think we
 
00:34:28.109 --> 00:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
may have had between then and now maybe
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
there's been five or six charges filed
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
with us so I don't think there would be
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
an inordinate amount of charges filed um
 
00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
and certainly back to subpoena power um
 
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
if there was some issue and we needed an
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
injunction or something we have the
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
ability to have that conversation with
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice to seek an
 
00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
injunction on behalf of of a student
 
00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
where something is really you know going
 
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
wrong there
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
so okay so I think maybe we're okay on
 
00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
this I believe so are you comfortable I
