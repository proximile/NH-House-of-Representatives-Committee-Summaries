reviews

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
reviews
 
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 align:start position:0%
came about
 
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
in my role as a vice chair of the Health
 
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
and Human Services oversight committee
 
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
last term I see representative Pearson
 
00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 align:start position:0%
here today I don't know if he's
 
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
intending to speak on this but he's he's
 
00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 align:start position:0%
been our chair
 
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
and it was during testimony from about
 
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
the maternal mortality process that it
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
became clear that they could do some
 
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
good for our our citizens if they had
 
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
some money
 
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
they just hadn't asked for it before so
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
what we proposed during the oversight
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
hearing and what this is now the
 
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 align:start position:0%
execution of that promise
 
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
was the establishment on if you look at
 
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
it from a line
 
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
nine on the first page to 27 it really
 
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
describes the the establishment of the
 
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
fund and it's got Six Bullets on the
 
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
good that they could do ranging from
 
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
data analysis to quality improvement and
 
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
birthing facilities to improving
 
00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
coordination The Chronic Health Care
 
00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
conditions to and I think this is a big
 
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 align:start position:0%
one in New Hampshire unfortunately the
 
00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 align:start position:0%
on 21 to help individuals with substance
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
misuse screening treatment and Recovery
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
screening for mental health conditions
 
00:07:07.309 --> 00:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
and then public Outreach and education
 
00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:09.419 align:start position:0%
so that people understand the importance
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
of a good prenatal care and some of the
 
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
warning signs that they may have a
 
00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
problem so so that's really the bulk of
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
the policy question before you
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
shall we establish this dedicated fund
 
00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
the first sections line one through five
 
00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:27.319 align:start position:0%
is simply
 
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
proforma telling the treasurer that you
 
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
know we need to have those monies
 
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.110 align:start position:0%
know we need to have those monies
transferred

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of this is
 
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:40.740 align:start position:0%
um a finance issue that that would go to
 
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
division three
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
um I I will I will just head a headline
 
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
for you though for situational awareness
 
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
that it moves marriage money
 
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:56.660 align:start position:0%
to help
 
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
fund a program to help babies and moms
 
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna we're gonna take them the
 
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
marriage money that we're collecting
 
00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:06.419 align:start position:0%
from marriage licenses and marriage
 
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
officiate licenses and we're going to
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
move them from domestic violence in this
 
00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
bill to helping with our infant
 
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
mortality issues that's on the tune of
 
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
about 450 000 dollars
 
00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:22.379 align:start position:0%
but to help
 
00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:24.539 align:start position:0%
compensate for that I'd worked it out
 
00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:27.419 align:start position:0%
with the chair of Criminal Justice to
 
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
increase the domestic violence fees
 
00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:32.459 align:start position:0%
which were bizarrely only fifty dollars
 
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
you know it costs more to get married
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
than it does to you know beat somebody
 
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
um so so we're going to raise that up to
 
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
250 dollars and we're going to dedicate
 
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
those fines they were already dedicated
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
but this is at an increased level uh to
 
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
backfill the hole on domestic violence
 
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
there will be some concerns raised
 
00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:56.820 align:start position:0%
because this is about the third term
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
I've discussed this that oh no if you
 
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
don't do these dedicated funds we're not
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
going to fund domestic violence the way
 
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
it should that's not true I I made a
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
promise that I would use division three
 
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
to make sure the domestic violence fund
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
was protected and in fact in this last
 
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
budget cycle I increased the domestic
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
violence the the application of General
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
funds by well over the inflation rate so
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
I'm an advocate of making sure that we
 
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
have good healthy domestic violence
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
programs I'd like you to focus on the
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
policy issue if you wouldn't mind and
 
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
trust me that I'm not going to let the
 
00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:44.459 align:start position:0%
finance part of this have have problems
 
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
as this works its way through its budget
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
cycle so with that I I can take
 
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.870 align:start position:0%
cycle so with that I I can take
questions

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm having a little
 
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
hard time getting around the issue of
 
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:07.740 align:start position:0%
confining questions to the policy
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
because there is no Health policy here
 
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
because the the program is already
 
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
established the issue here is it not
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
true that the issue here is only the
 
00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839 align:start position:0%
funding piece no
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
no this is this is uh this establishes a
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
special fund for maternal mortality
 
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
review it's chartered with the six
 
00:10:30.889 --> 00:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
elements that it would do none of this
 
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
is in law uh and this would would
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
establish that fund for the first time
 
00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:39.779 align:start position:0%
so that's the policy issue shall the
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislature establish this special fund
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
to Pro to provide financial support to
 
00:10:48.829 --> 00:10:48.839 align:start position:0%
our maternal mortality efforts and I'm
 
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
asking you to say yes to that okay and I
 
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:53.579 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up if I may Mr chair
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
so in choosing to do that I really want
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
to know why
 
00:11:02.569 --> 00:11:02.579 align:start position:0%
you chose to do the smoke and mirrors of
 
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
taking from One Fund and going to
 
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
another and then replenishing that fund
 
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
why not just start with the fees in
 
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
section five and take them around to
 
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
where you wanted them to go in the first
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
place why do we have to do the puddle
 
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
jumping so so I take issue with a
 
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
description of it being smoke and
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
mirrors it's clearly in the legislation
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
I'm clearly here testifying what the
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
impact is so I I don't care to answer
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
that question I think it's offensive
 
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's not smoking mirrors it's a it's a
 
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
clear Financial issue that's not really
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
yes representative Merchant
 
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and also thank you
 
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
given the fact that this money is not
 
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
going to help the person who's paying it
 
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
doesn't in fact become a tax because in
 
00:11:59.690 --> 00:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
essence the fee is something that has to
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
benefit the person paying the fee so if
 
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
the person's paying the fee does benefit
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
from the fee I would not really taking a
 
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:11.700 align:start position:0%
tax and calling it a fee so I absolutely
 
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
love the question because it it really
 
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.150 align:start position:0%
love the question because it it really
juxtaposes

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
juxtaposes
 
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:17.870 align:start position:0%
juxtaposes
um

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
the situation that we're in now and and
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
let's say I I agree with the general
 
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
premise that a fee in a tax are
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
different and that a fee is intended to
 
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
provide a government benefit to the
 
00:12:35.569 --> 00:12:35.579 align:start position:0%
people who are paying it currently the
 
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
money from marriage license is going to
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
domestic violence programs as though
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
there's a causual link
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh or a Nexus
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
between marriage and beating your spouse
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
and and and and that I think is a more
 
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.329 align:start position:0%
and and and and that I think is a more
spurious

00:12:56.329 --> 00:12:56.339 align:start position:0%
spurious
 
00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:01.139 align:start position:0%
um uh uh analysis or a metaphor then
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
having this marriage money spent on
 
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
improving infant mortality issues I mean
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
you you you you would think that in most
 
00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
cases one of the outcomes of marriage is
 
00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:19.019 align:start position:0%
uh is children and this fund would be to
 
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
help provide for a healthier New
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire environment for those children
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
to be born
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
so I so so you could still make an
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
argument I think that this is not really
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
a fee
 
00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
um I think it's uh more of a fee than
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
the current uh status quo
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's less bad
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
so are you saying basically
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
this is really a tax and not a fee no
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
no I I I'd say that um uh it it it's
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's less of a tax than the current
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
statute and that uh to the extent that
 
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
one can rationalize that marriage
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
license money should go to other
 
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:11.180 align:start position:0%
programs uh I think it is more
 
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:13.860 align:start position:0%
consistent with the purpose and value of
 
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
marriage to have the money from those
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
marriage license fees directed towards
 
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
uh the healthy birth of children as
 
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to being directed into a
 
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:29.060 align:start position:0%
domestic violence program
 
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
most domestic violence occurs between
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
unmarried couples so you know it's and
 
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
this is a part of an issue I get it I've
 
00:14:41.689 --> 00:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
talked about this three terms now and
 
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
and I understand that uh my my support
 
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
for the uh institution of marriage is uh
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
is probably a little different than many
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
and but this is really a policy issue do
 
00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:56.459 align:start position:0%
we want to establish this dedicated fund
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
do we want this dedicated fund to have
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
those six enumerated responsibilities
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I think the primary
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
concern of this committee is thank you
 
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here my
 
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
question is to the increase in fees on
 
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence it seems that only
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars of a fee for a domestic
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
violence somebody who is found guilty of
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
a domestic violence offense is
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
incredibly low relative to the other and
 
00:15:29.449 --> 00:15:29.459 align:start position:0%
that part of fees is a restitution to to
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
prevent other victims in the future is
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
is that is that understanding correct or
 
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:35.660 align:start position:0%
am I getting something wrong here
 
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
okay so so far we've had a discussion on
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
taxes versus fees when you we talk about
 
00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:44.339 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence that's not a fee
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
that's a fine that's that's punishment
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
um so that fifty dollars under current
 
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
law is already going to the domestic
 
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:57.060 align:start position:0%
violence program and in order to help
 
00:16:00.769 --> 00:16:00.779 align:start position:0%
backfill the money that they may not
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
have because the financial fiscal note's
 
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
not complete
 
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.389 align:start position:0%
not complete
um

00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
we're increasing the fine from fifty
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
dollars which is ridiculous to 250
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
dollars and and uh that was done in
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
coordination with the chair of Criminal
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
Justice he's he's a he's a co-sponsor of
 
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
the bill does that does that answer your
 
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
question follow up thank you mostly my
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
follow-up question is does that mean
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
that when there's more domestic violence
 
00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
convictions there's more funding going
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
to the domestic violence fund and if
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
it's reducing it might be lower if it's
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
less of an issue well well sure there is
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
that correlation
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
um assuming that the criminal justice
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
system keeps up with uh charging and
 
00:16:47.569 --> 00:16:47.579 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting domestic violence I mean
 
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
that's that's sort of a random element
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
in today's environment are we going to
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
hold people accountable for their
 
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
criminal conduct but assuming that that
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
remains constant yeah there would be a
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
direct correlation and in a way that
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
kind of makes sense you know if there's
 
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
more domestic violence there would be
 
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
more money going to it if there's less
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
there would be less but but in any case
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
the vast preponderance of the money is
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
coming from the general funding from
 
00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:15.419 align:start position:0%
federal money and and you have my
 
00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
Assurance that as the chairman of
 
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
division three I will do everything I
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
can to protect the general funds going
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
to fund the domestic violence program
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes
 
00:17:30.169 --> 00:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you taking
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
my question uh so I'm I'm assuming that
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying that the domestic violence
 
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
fund will not in any way be harmed by
 
00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.470 align:start position:0%
fund will not in any way be harmed by
this

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
and the second question is the simple
 
00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:42.419 align:start position:0%
one is this a non-lapsing or elapsing
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
fund that it's going to be going into I
 
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
think this is elapsing I think we try to
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
default to lapsing but I I honestly
 
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to your question
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
it's just not in the um so I'm just
 
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
wondering if it's a laugh which one is
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
not which one are you asking about the
 
00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
new fund I want to establish yes the new
 
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.830 align:start position:0%
new fund I want to establish yes the new
fund

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
um okay I was I was confused I was
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
thinking we were talking about the other
 
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:14.150 align:start position:0%
thinking we were talking about the other
programs

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
um that's that's a good question I I I
 
00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:18.539 align:start position:0%
would not have a problem with making
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
this non-lapsing because relative to the
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
general funds uh this is a small amount
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
of money
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
um so so having this being non-lapsing I
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
don't think creates a financial
 
00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:33.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
Eternal deaths did we have last year or
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
the year before we we have people from
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
the Department here that can provide you
 
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
the one department has signed up to
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
speak later okay thank you thank you
 
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:57.299 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry yes
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
question so
 
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
um so this this review board already
 
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.130 align:start position:0%
um so this this review board already
exists

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
um and so what what does this do to the
 
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
Baseline I'm just trying to get a feel
 
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
for how much it actually grows what's
 
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
going in you say it's kind of scatter
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
shot how it's being funded now so what
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
does this where's the Baseline at now
 
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
and how does this impact that Baseline
 
00:19:22.909 --> 00:19:22.919 align:start position:0%
the the official baseline is zero
 
00:19:25.909 --> 00:19:25.919 align:start position:0%
um apparently they're not set up to to
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
receive any money and the board exists I
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
think on uh you know shoestrings and
 
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
borrowed Manpower from somewhere but but
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
the department is here Ms Tilly and and
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
I I forget Lisa's last name it starts
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
with an S but they they could provide
 
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
you with those details
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'll try mine again and I'll I'll
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
apologize for the inordfulness of my
 
00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:00.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
so the board and the review already
 
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.029 align:start position:0%
so the board and the review already
exist

00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
why is this not purely a matter for the
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
budget cycle and finance and Ways and
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
Means rather than bringing it to Health
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
and Human Services
 
00:20:21.049 --> 00:20:21.059 align:start position:0%
well first it starts with the department
 
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
and the governor I I we the legislature
 
00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:27.419 align:start position:0%
doesn't normally just step in and say
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
we're going to throw money at you that
 
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980 align:start position:0%
we've we've not had a request in Prior
 
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
years and as we heard in HHS oversight
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
the lack of funding was hindering some
 
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
of the good work that they could be
 
00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:44.900 align:start position:0%
doing to representative Nutter uphams
 
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
question at least the implication is
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
will this money get us any improvement
 
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:54.500 align:start position:0%
in our
 
00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality rates it was
 
00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
testimony in HHS oversight that it it
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
would be contributory that it would help
 
00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
with their mission and I I don't know we
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
have so few babies in New Hampshire I'd
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
like that to be a good situation as much
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
as possible did I answer your question
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
okay I see none thank you very much
 
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
okay going forward again now after we
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
get past the prime sponsor in each bill
 
00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
we are going to be limiting some
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
subsequent testimony to three minutes
 
00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
uh so please be mindful of that as we
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
proceed uh the next person signed up to
 
00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill is representative
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Mark Pearson I
 
00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
spent six happy years in this committee
 
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
the last two is Chairman I presently
 
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
chair children and family law and I'm
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
happy to be a co-sponsor of this bill
 
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:10.740 align:start position:0%
America leads the world in many things
 
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.470 align:start position:0%
America leads the world in many things
but

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
one area where we lag woefully behind is
 
00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
in the area of the morbidity and
 
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
mortality of women who are about to give
 
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
birth or who have just given birth I
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
think I read we are 20th amongst first
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
world Nations
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
while we can Intuit reasons for this
 
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.049 align:start position:0%
while we can Intuit reasons for this
bill

00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:33.059 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:36.539 align:start position:0%
good solid data is much more helpful in
 
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
identifying specific issues along the
 
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:40.220 align:start position:0%
way towards
 
00:22:42.649 --> 00:22:42.659 align:start position:0%
data-driven conclusions that will yield
 
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
much needed improvements
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
this Bill calls for getting that data
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
line 15.
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
our legislature is notorious for passing
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
legislation that is wise and feels good
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
and is left languishing for lack of
 
00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.610 align:start position:0%
and is left languishing for lack of
funding

00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
this bill has some funding mechanisms in
 
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.770 align:start position:0%
this bill has some funding mechanisms in
it

00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
I will leave the explanation and defense
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
of the specifics to those who crafted
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'm simply here as a fiscally
 
00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:15.419 align:start position:0%
conservative and compassionate
 
00:23:15.419 --> 00:23:17.090 align:start position:0%
conservative and compassionate
Republican

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
Republican
 
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
to encourage you to enable our state
 
00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
better to support women and their babies
 
00:23:25.549 --> 00:23:25.559 align:start position:0%
in this area of great need that is my
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr chairman thank you
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Pearson
 
00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald
 
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
um I have a question that I'll another
 
00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
question I'll save for further testimony
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
which is kind of a prequel to what I'm
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
about to ask you but that is
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
um you want data it sounds like you want
 
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:51.140 align:start position:0%
more information
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
and my curiosity is
 
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
can't we just look to some other states
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
as far as data acquisition goes can we
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
look to some other states because I I
 
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
suspect New Hampshire is not entirely
 
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
unique in this regard can we look to
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
other states and what they've already
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
done just to maybe save some money thank
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative King you
 
00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:13.799 align:start position:0%
are singing one of my songs I tell
 
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
people I tell myself if you're crafting
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
a bill find out what other states are
 
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
doing that data will help us I think we
 
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
also need to know how we're doing here
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:39.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:42.179 align:start position:0%

uh presented to the HHS legislative
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
oversight back in December and that's
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
available online as well
 
00:25:36.299 --> 00:25:37.909 align:start position:0%
available online as well
in

00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
2012 RSA 13230 established the maternal
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
mortality review panel for New Hampshire
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
that Review Committee is charged to
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
conduct comprehensive multi-disciplinary
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
reviews of maternal deaths for
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
identifying the factors that existed at
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
the time of death as well as data
 
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.950 align:start position:0%
the time of death as well as data
analysis

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
and de-identified then review of what
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
happens so that recommendations can be
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
made to hopefully reduce or prevent
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
maternal deaths moving forward in our
 
00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.130 align:start position:0%
maternal deaths moving forward in our
state

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
there was a question previously about
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
other states most states in the U.S do
 
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
have maternal mortality review
 
00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.570 align:start position:0%
have maternal mortality review
committees

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:20.580 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire ours is a
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary committee that is
 
00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
made up of Obstetricians
 
00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:28.100 align:start position:0%
family practitioners
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
nurses Community organizations Social
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
Services many of the professionals and
 
00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
organizations in our state states that
 
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
touch the lives of a pregnant woman and
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
then postpartum
 
00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
there was a question asked about the
 
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
number of deaths so between 2020 and
 
00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
2021 there were 11 pregnancy Associated
 
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
deaths and when we use the word
 
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
pregnancy Associated it's pregnancy
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
through one year after the end of
 
00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.630 align:start position:0%
through one year after the end of
pregnancy

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
00:26:59.450 --> 00:26:59.460 align:start position:0%
and so it's important to note that maybe
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
while 11 seems like a small number it's
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
11 too many deaths of our women and
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
there is much larger numbers when you
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
think about maternal morbidity and so
 
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
those are our near misses that are
 
00:27:12.779 --> 00:27:13.850 align:start position:0%
those are our near misses that are
costing

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
costing
 
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
our states and our programs much money
 
00:27:18.769 --> 00:27:18.779 align:start position:0%
to then support and help the mom through
 
00:27:21.169 --> 00:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
the process afterwards so those 11
 
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
deaths here in New Hampshire were
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
primarily made up of substance use
 
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
overdoses Then followed by cardiac and
 
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:32.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.010 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
personal non-lapsing
 
00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:39.419 align:start position:0%
funding that potentially this bill would
 
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:42.059 align:start position:0%
propose and I also just want to take a
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
minute to thank representative Edwards
 
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
for his efforts in bringing this bill
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
forward in hearing the concerns and the
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the committee so
 
00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:51.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
um the proposed funding in this bill
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
would allow the maternal mortality
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
Review Committee to enhance the work
 
00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:00.059 align:start position:0%
that's happening and So currently it's
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
Federal funding that is supporting this
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
work but due to the minimal funding
 
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
there's only so much that can be done
 
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
the the the additional funding here is
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
really too too pronged so the first
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
would allow for additional hours of data
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
extraction which would allow us to learn
 
00:28:18.649 --> 00:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
more about what has happened in these
 
00:28:18.659 --> 00:28:19.730 align:start position:0%
more about what has happened in these
deaths

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:22.260 align:start position:0%
and then it would allow funding for the
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
implementation of the recommendations so
 
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
there's currently no funding to support
 
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
the recommendations that come out of the
 
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
committee after reviewing these deaths
 
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
there there are some efforts of course
 
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
across our state looking at some of
 
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
these but nothing dedicated to this
 
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:40.980 align:start position:0%
committee's work and so most of the
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
deaths that are presented in the report
 
00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
you'll see and as I mentioned are
 
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:46.740 align:start position:0%
related to substance use and so you'll
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
see a lot of those recommendations are
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
focused that way because that's what we
 
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
saw for deaths the past two years
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
um and so while this funding will
 
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:57.419 align:start position:0%
support the enhanced work it is worth
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
noting that there is concern of removing
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
the funding from the domestic violence
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
work over to the maternal mortality
 
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.690 align:start position:0%
work over to the maternal mortality
committee

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
um because their work is also much
 
00:29:09.529 --> 00:29:09.539 align:start position:0%
important for the safety wrapping up
 
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
though thank you
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
you don't have to wrap I mean are you
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
are you all set yeah yeah I'm happy to
 
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
take any questions questions uh
 
00:29:18.769 --> 00:29:18.779 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro
 
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
taking this question earlier testimony
 
00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.029 align:start position:0%
taking this question earlier testimony
um

00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
referenced infant mortality does the
 
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality review board deal
 
00:29:33.649 --> 00:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
with infant mortality as well or is that
 
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
a different
 
00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:35.990 align:start position:0%
a different
group

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
so we have two different
 
00:29:40.669 --> 00:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
mortality review committees in our state
 
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
there is an infant and child fatality
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
Review Committee that is charged with
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
separate work and then there's the
 
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality
 
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
so this is specific to the maternal
 
00:29:53.389 --> 00:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
mortality thank you
 
00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:56.100 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:29:58.370 --> 00:29:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
00:30:00.649 --> 00:30:00.659 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here is
 
00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
this committee focused on maternal
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
mortality or has the scope expanded to
 
00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
maternal morbidity I understand that's
 
00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:09.299 align:start position:0%
also an issue but it seems tasked
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
specifically to mortality in my reading
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
so the charge of the committee is
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
specific to mortality
 
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
um because the the direction is set by
 
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
the RSA and by CDC guidance for because
 
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
this is a national effort to look at
 
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality across the country
 
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
but there are conversations of what can
 
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
we do through our recommendations to
 
00:30:33.649 --> 00:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
prevent getting to the mortality piece
 
00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
which of course focuses then on the
 
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.130 align:start position:0%
which of course focuses then on the
morbidity

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
morbidity
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
yes representative McLean
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I understand how
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
the funding would allow you to do
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
um extra data analysis things of that
 
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
nature I'm just curious as to the
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
mechanism of of how the implementation
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
would occur I would assume that would be
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
other agencies that would be doing
 
00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
implementing and not necessarily the
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
board so how how would that funding be
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
leveraged by this board I'm not quite
 
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
understanding how that would work yeah
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question my
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
understanding is because the oversight
 
00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
of this committee sits in public health
 
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
within the maternal and child health
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
section that the funding would come
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
through the division and it would likely
 
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:30.059 align:start position:0%
be put out through contracts in our
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
state for the people who are doing the
 
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
work at the community level but with the
 
00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
direction and scope set by the
 
00:31:39.769 --> 00:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
okay I see none
 
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
they also signed up to testify is Lynn
 
00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
from the nhca dsv and I'll let you
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
am I on now there we go good morning Mr
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee my
 
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
name is Lynn shallette I'm the executive
 
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Coalition
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
against Domestic and Sexual Violence and
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
I'm joined by Pamela English our
 
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
administrative director I'm here to
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition to house bill 598. I
 
00:32:36.889 --> 00:32:36.899 align:start position:0%
want to be clear we are not taking a
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
position on the funding for the maternal
 
00:32:42.049 --> 00:32:42.059 align:start position:0%
mortality review board we do however
 
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
object to removing a stable source of
 
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
funding for domestic violence services
 
00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence prevention program
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
was created by the legislature in 1981
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
establishing a guaranteed funding source
 
00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
for these Services the Coalition where
 
00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
Pam and I work is the umbrella
 
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
Organization for the 12 community-based
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
crisis centers in New Hampshire that
 
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
serve approximately 15 000 victims of
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
sexual and domestic violence every year
 
00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
and one of those member programs is here
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
to testify as well
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
this program over the course of its life
 
00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:15.539 align:start position:0%
has supported tens of thousands of
 
00:33:15.539 --> 00:33:16.610 align:start position:0%
has supported tens of thousands of
victims

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
victims
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
the dvpp is made up of several funds as
 
00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
you've heard today General funds being
 
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
one of those those are important funds
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
they have also very varied widely over
 
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
the history of this program
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
if we went back about 10 years pretty
 
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.220 align:start position:0%
consistently the general funds were
 
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
about sixty thousand dollars in the last
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
10 years they have varied from a low of
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
2 000 to a high of well over a million
 
00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:41.460 align:start position:0%
another portion of this fund is the
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
marriage licenses that we're discussing
 
00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.970 align:start position:0%
marriage licenses that we're discussing
today

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Edwards suggested
 
00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:48.059 align:start position:0%
that the connection between marriage and
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
domestic violence is spurious the data
 
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
from our program shows exactly the
 
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:53.750 align:start position:0%
from our program shows exactly the
opposite

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
opposite
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
we collect data on the individuals that
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
we serve and according to Statewide data
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
over the last five years 27 percent of
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
the victims that our programs served
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
were in spousal relationships or
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
formerly spousal relationships in fact
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
it's the highest relationship connector
 
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
of all of the people that we serve
 
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
and and just to give you a kind of
 
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
national perspective 30 other states
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
utilize marriage license fees to support
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
domestic violence programs in New
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these fees bring in
 
00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:29.339 align:start position:0%
approximately 450 000 to 500 000 a year
 
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
however what I really want to address
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
today is the importance of continued
 
00:34:35.329 --> 00:34:35.339 align:start position:0%
stable funding for domestic violence
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
Services unfunded programs should never
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
be the reasons that we don't serve a
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
domestic violence victim in New
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and while we appreciate the
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor's commitment to funding these
 
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
life-saving programs the alternative
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
funding source proposed in this bill is
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
inadequate and unstable for two specific
 
00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
reasons as you've heard the first way
 
00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
this bill would change the current
 
00:34:59.930 --> 00:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
funding structure is to increase the
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
fine imposed under Joshua's Law on
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
domestic violence convictions
 
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:06.900 align:start position:0%
currently Joshua's Law brings in on an
 
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
average of about 42 thousand dollars a
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
year ranging from a low of approximately
 
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
thirty eight thousand to a high of about
 
00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.050 align:start position:0%
thirty eight thousand to a high of about
55.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
55.
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
unfortunately fines collected on
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
convicted offenders are not a stable
 
00:35:20.569 --> 00:35:20.579 align:start position:0%
source of funding
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
the first reason for that is collecting
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
and redistributing those fines uh is not
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
a consistent practice hey if you could
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
start wrapping up please okay uh what we
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
know about the collection of these fines
 
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire courts is that
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
they are often paid late 40 percent of
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
offenders do not pay on the day of
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
conviction 38 percent of offenders delay
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
their payment usually for an average of
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
six months and 24 percent of offenders
 
00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
never pay the other issue is that
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
quintupling the fine will not solve the
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
problem currently many offenders do not
 
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
pay and according to the Federal Reserve
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
more than 40 percent of the people in
 
00:35:58.370 --> 00:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
the United States do not have four
 
00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars in the bank to address
 
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
an emergency The Collection rate of
 
00:36:04.609 --> 00:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
these will not improve so thank you we
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
encourage you to vote itl on this bill
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Ms English would you like
 
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
to testify or you hear for questions
 
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
to take questions okay questions for
 
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
these ladies
 
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.150 align:start position:0%
these ladies
yes

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:18.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question so just to clarify
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
um representative Edwards testified that
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
he would make sure that the funding Gap
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
would be plugged your concern then is
 
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
not for this cycle but down the road for
 
00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
subsequent Cycles because it would be
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
tied into the general fund and that's
 
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
where your concern lies our primary
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
concern thank you for the question
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative I appreciate it our
 
00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:44.099 align:start position:0%
primary concern is that general fund
 
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
dollars fluctuate and fines that are
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
assessed on convicted criminals are not
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
collected consistently universally due
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
to several factors it's difficult to
 
00:36:56.089 --> 00:36:56.099 align:start position:0%
collect those fines but often offenders
 
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
don't have the money either so just
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
increasing the fine will not ensure a
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
stable source of funding whereas the
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
marriage license funding year after year
 
00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
is at a relatively level level so our
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
programs can rely on those funds
 
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.109 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
today

00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
um I I have a question for you about any
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
correlation between offenders that are
 
00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:23.339 align:start position:0%
in a condition of non-payment and
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
reoffending in addition in in future
 
00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
domestic violence situations is there a
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
correlation is this something that we
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
need to be digging in further that this
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
is just a canary
 
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative recidivism rates are very
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to track for many reasons so
 
00:37:41.329 --> 00:37:41.339 align:start position:0%
much of the pattern of abuse is often
 
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
not reported to law enforcement not
 
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
prosecuted as the sponsor noted earlier
 
00:37:48.589 --> 00:37:48.599 align:start position:0%
today so it's very hard to know whether
 
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
a fine be it small or large impacts an
 
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
offenders Behavior going forward I think
 
00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
what we can most hope is that we fund
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
prevention programs and try to stop that
 
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
behavior before it occurs follow up as a
 
00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up I wasn't asking about
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
causation I was asking about correlation
 
00:38:05.569 --> 00:38:05.579 align:start position:0%
when you look at repeat offenders is
 
00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
there a correlation between repeat
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
offenders and non-repeed offenders and
 
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
their payment status on prior fines
 
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I don't think
 
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:16.740 align:start position:0%
we know that because of the difficulty
 
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
in really collecting data on reoffensis
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
or recidivism I have not seen any
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative McKay
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
tell exactly what position you're taking
 
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:39.740 align:start position:0%
on this bill are you willing to tell us
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
whether you support or oppose
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative McKay we are not taking a
 
00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
position at all on funding maternal
 
00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.910 align:start position:0%
position at all on funding maternal
mortality

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
mortality
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
clearly these are two very important
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
programs and it's unfortunate that we're
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
um in a discussion about them competing
 
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
for funding
 
00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.150 align:start position:0%
for funding
um

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.950 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
aside from the fact that you're saying
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
the fines are less
 
00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
consistent and also you mentioned that
 
00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:23.339 align:start position:0%
it was approximately forty thousand
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
dollars compared to four hundred and
 
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:32.839 align:start position:0%
do you have any ideas about what other
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism for domestic for the
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
domestic violence programs would leave
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
you feeling more assured that they will
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
be funded at a consistent
 
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:42.650 align:start position:0%
be funded at a consistent
um

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
on a consistent basis I I think that um
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
the representative has assured us that
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
it will happen and I trust that he feels
 
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
that way and will do his best to do that
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
but we can't necessarily depend on one
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
person saying that um
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
he'll make sure
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
um so is there any other funding
 
00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:07.079 align:start position:0%
mechanism that you would see as being
 
00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:07.690 align:start position:0%
mechanism that you would see as being
um

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:07.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
a consistent and stable funding
 
00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for the domestic violence
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
programs thank you for the question
 
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative yes the marriage license
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
fees have been a reliable stable source
 
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:20.700 align:start position:0%
of funding very consistent year to year
 
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
to year so our only ask with this bill
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
is to keep that funding source intact
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
the general fund dollars of course are
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
very valuable you'll hear that from a
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
program this afternoon we're not here
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
seeking a new funding source we are
 
00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:35.579 align:start position:0%
simply asking not to take this one away
 
00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you as a
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
follow-up to that question uh would your
 
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bill be eliminated if
 
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:53.300 align:start position:0%
what we decided to do was eliminate
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
section four which is the special
 
00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.050 align:start position:0%
 
part

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:02.060 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
which is what
 
00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
I think you are
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about actually it would be
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
section three and four and if we took
 
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
section five and had the extra fees paid
 
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
directly into the maternal mortality
 
00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:24.359 align:start position:0%
review board would that re would that
 
00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
take away your concerns about this bill
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I don't think it
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
would because to the points that some of
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
you raised earlier today the underlying
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
use of these funds should be connected
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
to the reason that they are collected in
 
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
the first place and they are collected
 
00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:41.339 align:start position:0%
because someone has been convicted
 
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
Beyond A Reasonable Doubt of a domestic
 
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
violence crime so I believe it's
 
00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
appropriate should there be a change in
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
the fee in the future for that to stay
 
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
in the dvpp
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
okay so so just to be very clear follow
 
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
up sorry
 
00:41:59.450 --> 00:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
making that change would not
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh change your objection to this bill
 
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you representative
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
other questions for these ladies
 
00:42:11.089 --> 00:42:11.099 align:start position:0%
okay I'm representative Merchant thank
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman also thank you take a
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
question I want to follow up on
 
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
right now 50 of the fine goes into the
 
00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.770 align:start position:0%
right now 50 of the fine goes into the
fund

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
and representative Edward wants to
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
increase that to 250. if we only took
 
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
the 200 increase and put that into a
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
fund would that solve the issue as well
 
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant I just want to
 
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
clarify are you asking if there was an
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
increase and it went to the maternal
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
mortality would that address our our
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
concerns correct um no again because
 
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
these can these fines are assessed on
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
convictions for domestic violence also I
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
know you're going to hear this later
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
from one of our member programs we don't
 
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
keep any of these dollars at the
 
00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
Coalition they pass directly through to
 
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
the crisis centers and they are used for
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
direct reimbursement for out-of-pocket
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
costs that victims incur as a result of
 
00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
domestic violence so if the offender
 
00:43:01.609 --> 00:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
bashed a hole in someone's wall or rip
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
the telephone out of the wall or stole
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
something that is the kind of thing that
 
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
these funds are used for they're not
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
even used to pay the salaries at the
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
crisis centers these are reimbursing
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
tiny costs car repairs child care
 
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
a prescription that someone needs from
 
00:43:16.609 --> 00:43:16.619 align:start position:0%
an injury is a result of domestic
 
00:43:16.619 --> 00:43:18.710 align:start position:0%
an injury is a result of domestic
violence

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
violence
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative Leon sorry I apologize
 
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
for this follow-up I'm just curious that
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
seems like that would be a civil action
 
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
to go after the offender in order to pay
 
00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:38.099 align:start position:0%
that restitution is that something that
 
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
is not pursued by these groups in order
 
00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
to empower these women and make their
 
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
lives full
 
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
so crisis centers would not be able to
 
00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:46.859 align:start position:0%
be a party related to restitution as you
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
know restitution happens in a criminal
 
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:51.540 align:start position:0%
case when there is a conviction courts
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
infrequently order restitution and it's
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
also very difficult to collect when it
 
00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
can be collected that is wonderful but
 
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
that's a very small number of cases that
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
that ever happens in most most of these
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
cases are never in the criminal justice
 
00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:08.089 align:start position:0%
cases are never in the criminal justice
system

00:44:08.089 --> 00:44:08.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no other questions thank you
 
00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:15.660 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
and I'll leave copies of our written
 
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:18.780 align:start position:0%

and the last card I have for in terms of
 
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
someone signing up to testify is from

I'm here today in opposition to House
 
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
Bill 598 and I appreciate the
 
00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today
 
00:44:59.210 --> 00:44:59.220 align:start position:0%
I have significant concerns about the
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
impact that this bill would have on our
 
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
organization's ability to meet the needs
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
of victims and their families served
 
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
throughout Belknap County
 
00:45:09.109 --> 00:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
we see firsthand every day how important
 
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
this funding is to our program dvpp
 
00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
funds are used to provide essential
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
it's important that we're able to
 
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
maintain a stable reliable source of
 
00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:44.579 align:start position:0%
funding to be able to continue meeting

the needs of victims in our community
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
this bill jeopardizes that and if passed
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
we would not receive the same level of
 
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
funding that we currently receive under
 
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
the existing system
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm grateful for the legislative Slater
 
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
for being so supportive of our programs
 
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
and our funding please vote no on this
 
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:02.220 align:start position:0%
bill to ensure that we can continue to
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
help those in need in our community I'd
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions okay

since 2005
 
00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:10.740 align:start position:0%
there's been a law in the books to allow
 
00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.109 align:start position:0%
there's been a law in the books to allow
transgender

00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:17.819 align:start position:0%
people who've had a sex change to change

their gender marker on their birth
 
00:48:19.619 --> 00:48:22.910 align:start position:0%
their gender marker on their birth

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
in the past two years
 
00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
only 44 people
 
00:48:29.329 --> 00:48:29.339 align:start position:0%
were able to change their birth record
 
00:48:29.339 --> 00:48:35.150 align:start position:0%
were able to change their birth record
information

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
most of the most of the people I know my
 
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
friends my transgender Community friends
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
most of them were born out of state and
 
00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
for many of them it was easy to go out
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
of state to where they were born and
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
change their information
 
00:48:52.849 --> 00:48:52.859 align:start position:0%
not so in for people born in the state
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
those that I know that are older or like
 
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.410 align:start position:0%
those that I know that are older or like
myself

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
or or younger
 
00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
for those who don't know I'm 70 years
 
00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.290 align:start position:0%
for those who don't know I'm 70 years
old

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
old
 
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
so and I knew I was a transgender person
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
the folks that have been born in New
 
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as they've gone over many of
 
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:16.740 align:start position:0%
them have given up trying to get their
 
00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:19.740 align:start position:0%
birth records changed because it's in
 
00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
many ways the the process is not clear
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
and we've even heard that there are some
 
00:49:29.569 --> 00:49:29.579 align:start position:0%
justices that will grant
 
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
the gender change information
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
not fully understanding
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
the amount of information that's
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
required and and others won't grant that
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and in many states
 
00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
you can change the gender on your
 
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
you can do the same thing with the
 
00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:58.970 align:start position:0%
you can do the same thing with the
passport

00:49:58.970 --> 00:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
passport
 
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
for the federal government
 
00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
I wish it were that easy
 
00:50:05.809 --> 00:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
to change the information on the birth
 
00:50:05.819 --> 00:50:08.390 align:start position:0%
to change the information on the birth
record

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
you have to understand you have to think
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
your birth certificate usually sits in a
 
00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
drawer you hardly ever use it possibly
 
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
when you're young or the first time you
 
00:50:22.130 --> 00:50:22.140 align:start position:0%
go for a passport if you have to bring
 
00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:24.300 align:start position:0%
your passport along I mean your birth
 
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
certificate along
 
00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
prove where you were born and
 
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
when you were born
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
they don't check the gender
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
on the birth certificate for many of
 
00:50:36.119 --> 00:50:37.430 align:start position:0%
on the birth certificate for many of
those

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
in fact I don't know if the gender is
 
00:50:41.089 --> 00:50:41.099 align:start position:0%
really required on any of those because
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
a passport for instance requires a birth
 
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
certificate to be submitted
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
on same thing for the initial driver's
 
00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:00.660 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm bringing this piece of
 
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
legislation as I've done a couple of
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
times before to simplify the process
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
as well as for consistent with how we
 
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
to get
 
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
the information concern um
 
00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:24.140 align:start position:0%
the information
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
required to change the gender and the
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
birth certificate an individual has to
 
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.349 align:start position:0%
birth certificate an individual has to
get

00:51:30.349 --> 00:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
still has to get
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
information from their Physicians who
 
00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
are taking care of them in most cases
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me in most cases a transgender
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
person will not only have their their
 
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
personal physician they'll have a
 
00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:48.770 align:start position:0%
personal physician they'll have a
therapist

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:48.780 align:start position:0%
therapist
 
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
quite possibly a psychiatrist
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
neural neurologist but uh
 
00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
other folks that are responsible for
 
00:51:59.329 --> 00:51:59.339 align:start position:0%
their care
 
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
and they and the petitioner has to get
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
information to submit for changing the
 
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's the way it currently is and
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
that's the way the spill rates is they
 
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
will still have to get that information
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
that information was needed to provide
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
to the court before there is no form to
 
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
fill out
 
00:52:28.849 --> 00:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
that asks for that information right now
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's sort of free form
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
that the Physicians are requested to
 
00:52:35.809 --> 00:52:35.819 align:start position:0%
essentially send a letter
 
00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:39.800 align:start position:0%
that our individual can bring to court
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
what I would like to see is that the
 
00:52:44.329 --> 00:52:44.339 align:start position:0%
current forms that are used in the Vital
 
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
Records Office
 
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
actually have a place to check off the
 
00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:49.670 align:start position:0%
actually have a place to check off the
Box

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
Box
 
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's been changed
 
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
since I last reviewed it but it doesn't
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
even include anywhere on the form
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
to say that the gender information is
 
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
so why is it so important to change the
 
00:53:09.359 --> 00:53:13.250 align:start position:0%
so why is it so important to change the
information

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's simple in some cases simple simply
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
being able to change an m to an F or an
 
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
F to an m on this piece of paper
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
might save a life
 
00:53:26.809 --> 00:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
especially For Youth and for young
 
00:53:26.819 --> 00:53:29.510 align:start position:0%
especially For Youth and for young
adults

00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
they might may not use this
 
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
document from what for much except for
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
what I've explained but from us
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
a personal perspective
 
00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:44.220 align:start position:0%
is to have this document reflect who
 
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
they are
 
00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
as well as if they've had a
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
court-ordered name changed to update the
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
birth record to reflect that
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
this is what I did in
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
2015 actually in 2016. I had my birth
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
record changed in Newton Massachusetts
 
00:54:06.049 --> 00:54:06.059 align:start position:0%

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
form at the things agenda on my New
 
00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:11.420 align:start position:0%

Physician's name and it was notarized
 
00:54:17.210 --> 00:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
and I took that to Massachusetts and
 
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
they accepted that information and I was
 
00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:23.099 align:start position:0%

I was a mediocre student and very
depressed

00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
depressed
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
and found it very difficult I was always
 
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
also a very feminine kid and I was uh
 
00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:08.819 align:start position:0%

changed to Stratford County
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
courthouse in March of 2016. I
 
00:56:25.079 --> 00:56:26.809 align:start position:0%
courthouse in March of 2016. I
immediately

00:56:26.809 --> 00:56:26.819 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
drove to Newton Massachusetts and had my
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
birth record change
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
then it came back up to Portsmouth and
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
had my social security information
 
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.370 align:start position:0%
had my social security information
changed

00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
and then I went to the DMV to change my
 
00:56:40.079 --> 00:56:41.630 align:start position:0%
and then I went to the DMV to change my
license

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
well it was that difficult
 
00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
I had to get additional information to
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
change that info license not because I
 
00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.140 align:start position:0%
was changing it but because I had had a
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
CDL before and I had to cancel the CDL
 
00:56:59.329 --> 00:56:59.339 align:start position:0%
before I could get my driver's license
 
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:10.140 align:start position:0%
it wasn't until I was 69 years old
 
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
last April that I finally had my gender
 
00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:14.750 align:start position:0%
last April that I finally had my gender
surgery

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
surgery
 
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
it was important enough even to that
 
00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:18.890 align:start position:0%
it was important enough even to that
point

00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
to get put my life on the line
 
00:57:32.329 --> 00:57:32.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to save some lives here
 
00:57:35.809 --> 00:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's as simple as that
 
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
in past years I've had other other
 
00:57:42.049 --> 00:57:42.059 align:start position:0%
reasons but this is the most important
 
00:57:42.059 --> 00:57:44.089 align:start position:0%
reasons but this is the most important
one

00:57:44.089 --> 00:57:44.099 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
um our youth or a transgender youth are
 
00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:50.579 align:start position:0%
one of the highest groups of to
 
00:57:50.579 --> 00:57:51.829 align:start position:0%
one of the highest groups of to
um

00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
students and and transgender people that
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
consider suicide or have attempted
 
00:57:57.839 --> 00:57:59.210 align:start position:0%
consider suicide or have attempted
suicide

00:57:59.210 --> 00:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to save some life here
 
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
if we can get this through
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
in its simplest form it will change the
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
gender marker from an m to F or F to m
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative thank
 
00:58:17.809 --> 00:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much any any uh yes
 
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
so just to confirm the process in a
 
00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:25.750 align:start position:0%
so just to confirm the process in a
nutshell

00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
nutshell
 
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that what this bill does
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
is simply remove the necessity and all
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
the Hoops that go along with the court
 
00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:36.410 align:start position:0%
the Hoops that go along with the court
proceeding

00:58:36.410 --> 00:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
to change your gender marker in the
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
first instance
 
00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
and then because of concerns we've heard
 
00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
in the past about people changing their
 
00:58:50.089 --> 00:58:50.099 align:start position:0%
mind or or going back and forth or
 
00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:53.339 align:start position:0%
other concerns that may or may not
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
actually be out there it then requires
 
00:58:59.329 --> 00:58:59.339 align:start position:0%
if there's a further change that change
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
must go to the court is that correct
 
00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
that is correct thank you

can you elaborate a little bit more I'm
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about this question of
 
01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:00.839 align:start position:0%
having to get rid of the CDL
 
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
get the license uh as you wanted it can
 
01:00:08.569 --> 01:00:08.579 align:start position:0%
you explain that in a little bit more
 
01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
detail please I think it was it was more
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
of a timing thing I had gotten off the
 
01:00:16.849 --> 01:00:16.859 align:start position:0%
road in 2015 and I still had my CDL
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
license and I had decided at that point
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
that I was retired from driving and to
 
01:00:29.329 --> 01:00:29.339 align:start position:0%
stay to save as a valid CDL license I
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
was going to have to get a another
 
01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.549 align:start position:0%
was going to have to get a another
um

01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:37.260 align:start position:0%
um boy it's getting old you forget these
 
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
terms I was gonna have to get go to my
 
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
my doctor and get another physical
 
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
um just for for uh see to maintain my
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
CDL so I decided at the time as as long
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
as I was changing my my
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
birth record my my sex identifier on my
 
01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
driver's license it was time for me to
 
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:01.980 align:start position:0%
get rid of the CDL and so I I decided to
 
01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
get just a regular passenger vehicle
 
01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.170 align:start position:0%
get just a regular passenger vehicle
license

01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:01:09.289 --> 01:01:09.299 align:start position:0%
and follow up so if I'm understanding
 
01:01:11.569 --> 01:01:11.579 align:start position:0%
correctly then this was not a case of
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
anybody at the DMV or the state failing
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
to follow proper procedures or enforce
 
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
the lock right they were following the
 
01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:21.299 align:start position:0%
problem and at the time at the time I
 
01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:25.740 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that I had to uh uh
 
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
get additional information for my CDL
 
01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
and the reasons why I was not renewing
 
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
the CDL thank you for clarifying that
 
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:01:38.809 --> 01:01:38.819 align:start position:0%
yes representative Merchant
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
chairman I'll stick the question so I
 
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
want to be clear you're not asking for a
 
01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:50.700 align:start position:0%
line 22 to destroy the original
 
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
the original will always be retained
 
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
you're asking for it to be modified with
 
01:01:56.569 --> 01:01:56.579 align:start position:0%
a subsequent
 
01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:57.950 align:start position:0%
a subsequent
document

01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:01:59.930 --> 01:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:02.450 align:start position:0%
that's correct
um

01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
in all this and
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
when I got my record changed in
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that original document
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
still exists in their file
 
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.069 align:start position:0%
still exists in their file
um

01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
so I did not put that in
 
01:02:19.849 --> 01:02:19.859 align:start position:0%
to this this form the current
 
01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
the current
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
mechanism that's in place
 
01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
does not even require a marginal note
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
and that's a big thing for the
 
01:02:32.289 --> 01:02:32.299 align:start position:0%
transgender Community
 
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
what does require a marginal note on a
 
01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
changing a birth record is if you have a
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
name changed
 
01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.650 align:start position:0%
name changed
laughs

01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
laughs
 
01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
so the name change could potentially be
 
01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
recorded on the uh on the birth
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
certificate but I believe in its current
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
form neither the name or gender
 
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative palazzov
 
01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:03:08.109 --> 01:03:08.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
and this issues around identities are
 
01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:17.660 align:start position:0%
very diplomatic and I would expect that
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
some individuals even after
 
01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
um this changes they would still be a
 
01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
suicidal so do you have any statistics
 
01:03:32.569 --> 01:03:32.579 align:start position:0%
or do you have any expectations uh if
 
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
this bill go to effect like what would
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
be percentage of prevented suicides and
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
what would be percentage of
 
01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
suicides and watchedness still happening
 
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
I I don't have any specifics I do know
 
01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
that from the in talking with families
 
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
with transgender youth
 
01:03:59.030 --> 01:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.049 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:00.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
young people between the ages of 14 and
 
01:04:04.930 --> 01:04:04.940 align:start position:0%
18 who would require having a parent
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
sign along with them as far as the
 
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.309 align:start position:0%
sign along with them as far as the
information

01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
as far as the information required to
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
change and
 
01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:16.609 align:start position:0%
change and
um

01:04:16.609 --> 01:04:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
we have seen and when I talk about is
 
01:04:23.089 --> 01:04:23.099 align:start position:0%
that this little thing would help
 
01:04:23.099 --> 01:04:24.109 align:start position:0%
that this little thing would help
um

01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
them recognize that the state recognizes
 
01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:28.510 align:start position:0%
them recognize that the state recognizes
them

01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:31.460 align:start position:0%
as having changed
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's also as many parents have come to
 
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
me excuse me sorry I have asthma and I
 
01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
need to use my inhaler which is over
 
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
there so I come
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
the um the I've had parents come to me
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
and say how do I get this done or can I
 
01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
get this done and then I have to let
 
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
them know what the process is and many
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
of them will follow up on it and and
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
bring their child into court with them
 
01:05:07.849 --> 01:05:07.859 align:start position:0%
and and get things changed but it is
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
cumbersome on them as well they have to
 
01:05:12.049 --> 01:05:12.059 align:start position:0%
go through the process and they have to
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
get Physicians that'll work with them to
 
01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:17.339 align:start position:0%
identify that the child is currently
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
under their care has identified as being
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
the gender that they're living as for
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
many years and that they may be under
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
the help of a therapist and a
 
01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
psychologist their General physician and
 
01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.530 align:start position:0%
psychologist their General physician and
and

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
in some cases some procedures may have
 
01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
been performed or in underway they may
 
01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
be taking hormone blockers
 
01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
for some women change from a female to
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
male they may have had some
 
01:05:48.839 --> 01:05:51.710 align:start position:0%
male they may have had some
um

01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
breast reduction surgery I know of at
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
least one case where the young lady had
 
01:06:03.049 --> 01:06:03.059 align:start position:0%
large breasts to the point where they
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
had breast reduction
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
that helped them in the process from a
 
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
medical situation that the the weight on
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
their chest
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
um what's what's affecting their uh home
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
stature so there are different reasons
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
that people have undergone surgical
 
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
procedures to move forward
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
01:06:25.799 --> 01:06:28.250 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
Shapiro

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
Shapiro
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
representative is
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
under the system that we currently have
 
01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
where a doctor has to write a letter
 
01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
does that require
 
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
that there have been some kind of
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
medical procedures whether it's hormone
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
treatment or some kind of surgery or is
 
01:06:53.450 --> 01:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
that up to the specific Court
 
01:06:55.490 --> 01:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
um right now it's up to the court to
 
01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
make the decision on whether enough
 
01:07:02.589 --> 01:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
has enough medical
 
01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:07.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
or physical changes have been done to
 
01:07:14.569 --> 01:07:14.579 align:start position:0%
make the change follow up follow up so
 
01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
as well as being a more difficult
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
process for the person to complete it's
 
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
also a more subjective process where a
 
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
person might petition to have their
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
gender marker changed but um
 
01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
not necessarily have it come to fruition
 
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
that's correct I've even heard of cases
 
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
where a The Physician that had signed
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
documents was requested to come with the
 
01:07:48.349 --> 01:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
family to court to actually describe the
 
01:07:48.359 --> 01:07:50.870 align:start position:0%
family to court to actually describe the
situation

01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other questions
 
01:07:59.809 --> 01:07:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Cannon for
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
coming and testifying today I I want to
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
let you know that I deeply respect what
 
01:08:11.390 --> 01:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
you're doing coming forward I'm sure
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
this is very difficult for you
 
01:08:16.849 --> 01:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
I do have a question uh when you and it
 
01:08:20.650 --> 01:08:20.660 align:start position:0%
goes back to something uh representative
 
01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
pulls off at asked about the suicides
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
by removing this this
 
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
bump in the road for somebody on their
 
01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:34.789 align:start position:0%
bump in the road for somebody on their
license

01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
it gives them I'm sure it gives them
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
some type of
 
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:39.970 align:start position:0%
some type of
um

01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:39.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
but don't we still have a lot more to
 
01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
this is just one small little factor and
 
01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
that we have so much more to do with
 
01:08:58.970 --> 01:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
acceptance and the lack of bullying and
 
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
things that you've experienced and
 
01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:03.980 align:start position:0%
others have experienced is that true
 
01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:05.630 align:start position:0%
others have experienced is that true
yes

01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of work to be done
 
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.590 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of work to be done
Society

01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
Society
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
has a really hard time understanding
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on as far as a transgender
 
01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
person goes it's not something we just
 
01:09:23.829 --> 01:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
decide to do it's really hard to explain
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
I have known since I was 13 years old
 
01:09:28.249 --> 01:09:28.259 align:start position:0%
that I was different
 
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
and back in the 1960s there was no
 
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
information and I felt I was broken
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
I did not fit and I hoped what was going
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
on with me would go away
 
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
it never went away I did get married
 
01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
I thought it would go away then with
 
01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:49.259 align:start position:0%
physical relations
 
01:09:49.259 --> 01:09:50.870 align:start position:0%
physical relations
um

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
in a way I personally think maybe that
 
01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
was a good thing at that time because I
 
01:09:58.250 --> 01:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
have two wonderful daughters
 
01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
and and one's a senior bioscientist
 
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
so both both my family has done well
 
01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:07.130 align:start position:0%
so both both my family has done well
um

01:10:07.130 --> 01:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
I think most of my life I felt that I've
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
had to prove myself so I've excelled in
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
everything I've done
 
01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
the toughest thing I have done is when I
 
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
came out and decided to run for public
 
01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:23.390 align:start position:0%
came out and decided to run for public
office

01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
because I was really concerned about how
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
I would be perceived
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
I will be honest I received a death
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
threat on my first run for the school
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
board in Somersworth
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
and sadly I'm now a gun owner
 
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
direct and protect myself so it's a very
 
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
diff it's a very difficult world for
 
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
transgender people to live in
 
01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
and we have some of the especially in
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
the black community there's the highest
 
01:10:58.729 --> 01:10:58.739 align:start position:0%
death rate of transgender people
 
01:10:58.739 --> 01:10:59.450 align:start position:0%
death rate of transgender people
um

01:10:59.450 --> 01:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:00.770 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:03.169 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:11:03.169 --> 01:11:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative other
 
01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:08.510 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative other
questions

01:11:08.510 --> 01:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.970 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of this bill as you said
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
remove or reduce the number of deaths in
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
the okay and namely suicides right and
 
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
you also mentioned that there are other
 
01:11:29.689 --> 01:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
states that have already passed similar
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
legislation which makes it easier to
 
01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
change right 27 States 27 states do you
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
have any
 
01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
um well-documented evidence that the
 
01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:43.640 align:start position:0%
number of suicides by transgenders
 
01:11:47.209 --> 01:11:47.219 align:start position:0%
previous to those bills being passed in
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
their respective States has been reduced
 
01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
since the passing of these bills do you
 
01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
have any actual evidence to back that up
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
I don't have specifics I do know that
 
01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.990 align:start position:0%
I don't have specifics I do know that
um

01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
there well I mentioned 82 of our
 
01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
transgender Community have considered
 
01:12:06.649 --> 01:12:06.659 align:start position:0%
that was a study that was done across
 
01:12:11.209 --> 01:12:11.219 align:start position:0%
the U.S and um 46 of the entire
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
population have considered have
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
actually attempted suicide
 
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
so it's a substantial number of the
 
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
entire population I don't know if
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
specifics in the individual states but
 
01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.310 align:start position:0%

committee members my name is Patricia
 
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
pietzsu I am currently the acting State
 
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
Registrar for the division of Vital
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
Records and the Secretary of State's
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
office has no position on this bill I I
 
01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
prior to be coming to the Secretary of
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
State's office a matter of fact I was a
 
01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
city clerk and I did work with
 
01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative cannon on this bill a few
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
years ago with this I think she'll
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
remember me on that
 
01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
um the only thing that I wanted to bring
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
into your attention that in replacing 5c
 
01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
87 with this bill is that you are
 
01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.270 align:start position:0%
87 with this bill is that you are
removing

01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
removing
 
01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.350 align:start position:0%
removing
um

01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
the option for somebody that does have a
 
01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
certified court order that has gone
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
through the gender reassignment surgery
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to submit that so that's the
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
only thing we wanted to bring to your
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
attention they would still then be able
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
to still have their physician sign off
 
01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
on the form that will be provided by the
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records and everything
 
01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
like that but it'll be a committed
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether or not they would
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
want to still be allowed to add a that
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
court order for somebody that may have
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
gone through that gender reassignment
 
01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.930 align:start position:0%
gone through that gender reassignment
surgery

01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:16.940 align:start position:0%
surgery
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
but otherwise than that again it's your
 
01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:22.140 align:start position:0%
the committee's decision as to what you
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
want to do is whether or not to allow
 
01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
that because the court order normally
 
01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
would then remove the legal name change
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
that was brought up before from the
 
01:14:36.010 --> 01:14:36.020 align:start position:0%
marginal note whereas because in 5c
 
01:14:39.770 --> 01:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
87 4 if there is a legal name change on
 
01:14:42.649 --> 01:14:42.659 align:start position:0%
there the AKA would have to remain on
 
01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:44.940 align:start position:0%
the birth certificate under the marginal
 
01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.250 align:start position:0%
the birth certificate under the marginal
note

01:14:46.250 --> 01:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
note
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
um but that's all I have before you if
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
you have any questions I'd be more than
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them for you okay
 
01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.530 align:start position:0%
happy to answer them for you okay
questions

01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.810 --> 01:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
today I have a question for you about
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
the use of birth certificates where
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
they're used if that's used in the
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
process of determinations for
 
01:15:09.890 --> 01:15:09.900 align:start position:0%
incarceration or anything else I'm just
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
trying to understand where outside of
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
our normal record-keeping birth
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
certificates are used so birth
 
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
certificate is used for many things as
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
representative Canon mentioned you you
 
01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
need your birth certificate for your
 
01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
passport a lot of jobs now require you
 
01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
to have your birth certificate children
 
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
need to birth certificate in order to
 
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
get into school for sports when it comes
 
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
time to retirement social security so
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
there are many other different places
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
where the birth certificate maybe need
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
to be utilized
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
sorry as a follow-up is that used in the
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
case of incarceration or is that just
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
looked at through other through other
 
01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.550 align:start position:0%
looked at through other through other
metrics

01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
metrics
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
as far as license I don't know what is
 
01:15:50.770 --> 01:15:50.780 align:start position:0%
required as far as I'm concern
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
incarcerations goes I know that we have
 
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
at times receive requests from those
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
that are cars in in currently in prison
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
or maybe in the um
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
House of Corrections who require birth
 
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
certificate so we do receive them but
 
01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
can't say how often I thank you that's
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
just a larger more complicated question
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure we were
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
addressing it thank you
 
01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:16:24.649 --> 01:16:24.659 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
um we we did receive testimony if I
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
understood it correctly that the process
 
01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is a little bit more
 
01:16:34.490 --> 01:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
Byzantine than the process and maybe
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
some other uh States and you have to go
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
through a court process so when you look
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
at the the process in New Hampshire
 
01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
versus the more streamlined and I would
 
01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
say potentially lenient process in other
 
01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:48.169 align:start position:0%
say potentially lenient process in other
states

01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
do you see any other concerns that have
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
been generated in these other states by
 
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
going to this more streamlined process
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
well Mr representative McLean thanks for
 
01:16:59.689 --> 01:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
the question I've been in this position
 
01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
for only two months
 
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
so I can't really speak to the other
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
states I know that currently the court
 
01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
order is currently required for us but I
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
think representative Cannon had some
 
01:17:14.450 --> 01:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
good testimony as to what is happening
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
in other states
 
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
I see no other questions thank you very
 
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is
 
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh you indicate you'd like four minutes
 
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
I'd prefer if you could keep it as close
 
01:17:56.530 --> 01:17:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
good morning chair and committee my name
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
is representative James Rosner and I'm
 
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
here speaking as a transgender man I
 
01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
came out and began my transition about
 
01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:08.940 align:start position:0%
seven years ago and in that time my lack
 
01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
of sex change has not hindered My Life
 
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
as a man in any way other than through
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
trivial legal filings and insurance
 
01:18:15.679 --> 01:18:17.530 align:start position:0%
trivial legal filings and insurance
misunderstandings

01:18:17.530 --> 01:18:17.540 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings
 
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
I changed my name and gender marker on
 
01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
my driver's license and on other
 
01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
personal documents at the same time
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
because if you're not familiar changing
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
your legal identification twice in a row
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
is a big pain
 
01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:31.430 align:start position:0%
is a big pain
um

01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
so I intentionally did them all at the
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
same time I am not however able to
 
01:18:39.169 --> 01:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
update my birth certificate with
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
confidence because I have not completed
 
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
a sex change or what would be generally
 
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
interpreted as gender confirmation
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
surgery or bottom surgery or a genital
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
reconstructive surgery
 
01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.010 align:start position:0%
reconstructive surgery
um

01:18:52.010 --> 01:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
I had come to accept that having an
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
accurate legal birth record is just not
 
01:18:58.870 --> 01:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
a right that I have as a trans person
 
01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
I'm no longer able to use my birth
 
01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
certificate as a secondary means of
 
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
personal identification without it
 
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
becoming an ordeal I can only imagine
 
01:19:10.130 --> 01:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
how difficult that will be if when that
 
01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
presents itself if I am not able to
 
01:19:15.169 --> 01:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
correct that in a timely manner my
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
greatest concern with the current sex
 
01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
change requirement for updating birth
 
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
records is that it mandates an invasive
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
and personal surgical experience for all
 
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:25.980 align:start position:0%
transgender people who want to be
 
01:19:27.649 --> 01:19:27.659 align:start position:0%
recognized legally
 
01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
especially in the wake of so much Social
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
fear and confusion around gender
 
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
transition exceptionally so around
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoric children I find it
 
01:19:38.209 --> 01:19:38.219 align:start position:0%
disproportionately counterproductive for
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
the state to require that we must
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
undergo an intimate irreversible and
 
01:19:43.729 --> 01:19:43.739 align:start position:0%
extensive surgical procedure to be
 
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
recognized correctly as a transgender
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
person in our documents
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
mandates such as this only serve to
 
01:19:50.810 --> 01:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
pressure transgender individuals to
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
undergo gender affirming surgeries that
 
01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
do not contribute to their quality of
 
01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:55.450 align:start position:0%
do not contribute to their quality of
life

01:19:55.450 --> 01:19:55.460 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:19:57.890 --> 01:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
because transgender happiness and
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
self-comfort is not contingent on going
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
under the knife to better replicate our
 
01:20:03.890 --> 01:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
bodies to look cisgender or
 
01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:05.750 align:start position:0%
bodies to look cisgender or
non-transgender

01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
non-transgender
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
that isn't to say that these aren't
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
necessary but that transition is a very
 
01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
personal and specialized procedure and
 
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
um lists of happenings and changes that
 
01:20:18.169 --> 01:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
each individual decides for themself
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's not a one-size-fits-all blueprint
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
as I stated I have been living as a man
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
for seven years and I knew my entire
 
01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:33.780 align:start position:0%
life that I would rather live as a man
 
01:20:35.689 --> 01:20:35.699 align:start position:0%
despite all of this it's my personal
 
01:20:37.729 --> 01:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
decision with my body that I do not
 
01:20:39.770 --> 01:20:39.780 align:start position:0%
require a reconstructive genital surgery
 
01:20:42.649 --> 01:20:42.659 align:start position:0%
especially at its price of time money
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
pain and risk
 
01:20:46.130 --> 01:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
um that is not to say that these
 
01:20:47.689 --> 01:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
services are not completely necessary
 
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
for other individuals and I hope that
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
testimony will continue to contribute to
 
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:54.900 align:start position:0%
that understanding and knowledge but it
 
01:20:57.169 --> 01:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
is counterproductive to assert that this
 
01:20:59.450 --> 01:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
of all things is what constitutes my
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
ability to be socially and legally
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
and um I also wanted to add that was the
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
end of my testimony
 
01:21:11.689 --> 01:21:11.699 align:start position:0%
um I did while we were listening to our
 
01:21:14.530 --> 01:21:14.540 align:start position:0%
introduction look up some statistics on
 
01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh transgender legislation when that is
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
proposed and how that affects
 
01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:21.620 align:start position:0%
suicidality especially in minors
 
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
recently the Trevor Project in Texas
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
reported that there was a hundred and
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
fifty percent increase in calls from
 
01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
Texas youth uh when the transgender
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
threat was introduced to the Texas state
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
house last year there are many other
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
links and and studies that I can send
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
over but I don't want to take up any
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
more time here okay thank you very much
 
01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:43.970 align:start position:0%
more time here okay thank you very much
questions

01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak this morning is
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
morning my name is Abby Maxwell I live
 
01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:14.219 align:start position:0%
in Concord and I am here in support of
 
01:22:16.570 --> 01:22:16.580 align:start position:0%
HB 264
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
my daughter is 10 years old
 
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
when she was born we thought she was a
 
01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
boy she spent her toddler years
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
insisting to us that she was a girl
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
and she spent kindergarten in first
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
grade saying that she did not want to
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
exist if we kept making her be a boy
 
01:22:35.689 --> 01:22:35.699 align:start position:0%
at that time my husband and I could not
 
01:22:38.689 --> 01:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
even Define the word transgender
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
however we finally sought Medical Care
 
01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
in the form of a psychologist at one of
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
the best children's hospitals on the
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
East Coast
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
and we learned what it means to be
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
transgender and how to support our child
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
so that she could have a happy healthy
 
01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.330 align:start position:0%
so that she could have a happy healthy
life

01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
we gave her dresses allowed her to
 
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
change her name in pronouns and watched
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
as a light came on inside our child
 
01:23:03.050 --> 01:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
literally overnight
 
01:23:05.209 --> 01:23:05.219 align:start position:0%
now my daughter has been living happily
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
in her true gender for nearly half her
 
01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:08.990 align:start position:0%
in her true gender for nearly half her
life

01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
she even has a U.S passport issued under
 
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
the Trump Administration with the
 
01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
correct gender marker
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
yet at school she has an IEP and because
 
01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's birth certificate
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
laws her gender is listed as male on the
 
01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
very first page her teachers and vice
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
principal have worked hard to get this
 
01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:29.219 align:start position:0%
corrected because it's inaccurate it's
 
01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
an invasion of her privacy and it also
 
01:23:33.950 --> 01:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
opens the door to possible bullying and
 
01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.270 align:start position:0%
opens the door to possible bullying and
discrimination

01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
however because of the laws the school
 
01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
has been unsuccessful in making the
 
01:23:39.239 --> 01:23:40.910 align:start position:0%
has been unsuccessful in making the
correction

01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
correction
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
school is not the only place where this
 
01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
comes up
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
every time I sign my daughter up for a
 
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
day camp that requires a complete
 
01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
vaccination history as many do I also
 
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
have to out her as the wrong gender
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
appears at the top of the page
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
when I check her in at the doctors or
 
01:23:59.209 --> 01:23:59.219 align:start position:0%
the dentist the receptionist still sees
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
M rather than f
 
01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
my daughter like all of us has a right
 
01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
to her privacy she should not need to
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
explain what it means to be transgender
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
when she just wants to join art or music
 
01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.350 align:start position:0%
when she just wants to join art or music
camp

01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
camp
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
it is already difficult enough for our
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
family to exist in a country and state
 
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
where our daughter's right to Simply Be
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
herself and is constantly debated on a
 
01:24:25.070 --> 01:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
public stage this small change in New
 
01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law would harm no no one and
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
it would make her life in ours just a
 
01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
little easier and more importantly safer
 
01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time okay thank you
 
01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:38.390 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time okay thank you
questions

01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.290 --> 01:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is Erica Perez
 
01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
good morning members of the committee
 
01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
my name is Eric Perez I'm from
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire
 
01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today in support of HB 264
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire youth
 
01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:18.530 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire youth
movement

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
movement
 
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
before I saw this bill I was unaware
 
01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
that in order to change your sex marker
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
on your birth certificate in New
 
01:25:26.090 --> 01:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you must first according to
 
01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:27.729 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you must first according to
RSA

01:25:27.729 --> 01:25:27.739 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
5c87 have undergone what's referred to
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
as a sex change
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
right now on GoFundMe there are over 500
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
pages of people seeking help to pay for
 
01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
their top surgeries
 
01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
trans people everywhere but also in our
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
own communities already struggle with
 
01:25:46.729 --> 01:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
finding things like safe and secure
 
01:25:49.610 --> 01:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
housing and job security these surgeries
 
01:25:51.410 --> 01:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
that the state has made a requirement of
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
changing your sex marker costs thousands
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
of dollars and create just one more
 
01:25:58.490 --> 01:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
barrier for the trans community and our
 
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
states have to jump through having
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
surgery doesn't make you any more or
 
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
less trans especially when it's not a
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
financial decision everyone can make
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
this bill would make it so a notarized
 
01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:10.980 align:start position:0%
letter from your doctor would be enough
 
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
to start the process of changing your
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
gender marker and frankly I think that
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
should be enough
 
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
I would also like you to consider
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
creating an amendment to add an option
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
for an X gender marker to include
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
intersex people non-binary people and
 
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
other people who do not feel aligned
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
with an M or an F
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
so again please vote ought to pass on HB
 
01:26:34.129 --> 01:26:34.139 align:start position:0%
264 and thank you for listening okay
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:40.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak this morning is
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
Courtney Reed from the ACLU of New
 
01:26:49.679 --> 01:26:54.050 align:start position:0%
Courtney Reed from the ACLU of New
Hampshire

01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:56.209 --> 01:26:56.219 align:start position:0%
is Ms Reed here
 
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
oh there she is
 
01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman now you have three
 
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you chair McDonald
 
01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
I've just handed handed around a copy of
 
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
my testimony as well as a copy of a
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
academic article relating to the mental
 
01:27:27.649 --> 01:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
health benefits for Trans individuals
 
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
who have access to change the gender
 
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
markers on birth certificates and other
 
01:27:36.169 --> 01:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
IDs I think that this could serve to
 
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
bolster some of the emotional testimony
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
um so I would just like to provide a
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
brief statement of support for HB 264
 
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
and encourage all members of the
 
01:27:51.649 --> 01:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
committee to review the article that's
 
01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
going around which I reference in my
 
01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.610 align:start position:0%
going around which I reference in my
testimony

01:27:55.610 --> 01:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:27:59.450 --> 01:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
HB 264 is a bill that allows gender
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
affirming corrections to individuals
 
01:28:04.010 --> 01:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
birth certificates which is a crucial
 
01:28:06.290 --> 01:28:06.300 align:start position:0%
part of one's gender transition and is
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
foundational in ensuring individuals
 
01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
with historically marginalized gender
 
01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
identities can navigate institutions and
 
01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
legal systems which often require
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
consistency and documentation which
 
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:19.260 align:start position:0%
we've heard in some of the stories
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
earlier today
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh presently the state of New Hampshire
 
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
only allows individuals to change their
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
identification their gender
 
01:28:28.729 --> 01:28:28.739 align:start position:0%
identification on birth certificates
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
with the court order and HB 264 would
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
reduce the burden for individuals
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
wishing to make this change by enabling
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
the change of gender markers instead
 
01:28:40.570 --> 01:28:40.580 align:start position:0%
through a notarized certificate
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
provided by a health care provider
 
01:28:46.729 --> 01:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
passing HP 264 would put New Hampshire
 
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:48.540 align:start position:0%
on track with its pure States in New
 
01:28:52.129 --> 01:28:52.139 align:start position:0%
England most of which also require only
 
01:28:54.050 --> 01:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
a certification from a health care
 
01:28:56.450 --> 01:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
provider and would remove the present
 
01:28:58.669 --> 01:28:58.679 align:start position:0%
and unnecessarily taxing process from
 
01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
the courts and reduce this burden for
 
01:29:03.410 --> 01:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
transgender individuals as well
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
I also encourage members of the
 
01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
committee to consider the basic safety
 
01:29:09.709 --> 01:29:09.719 align:start position:0%
and well-being of trans individuals as
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
it relates to this bill
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
when a trans person is forced to show an
 
01:29:14.990 --> 01:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
ID document that doesn't match who they
 
01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
are they can often face discrimination
 
01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
or even violence
 
01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
this has been documented by the national
 
01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
transgender discrimination survey where
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
it was found 40 percent of respondents
 
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
with IDs that did not match their gender
 
01:29:30.110 --> 01:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
identity experienced harassment
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
medical and mental health professionals
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
have long recognized the importance of
 
01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
updated identity documents as a part of
 
01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
gender transition research from studies
 
01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
conducted in Massachusetts in Rhode
 
01:29:42.169 --> 01:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
Island the one I'm passing around where
 
01:29:44.090 --> 01:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
the process of changing one's gender
 
01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
identity marker is relatively easy
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
compared to the state of New Hampshire
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
found that legal gender marker and name
 
01:29:51.830 --> 01:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
change was associated with lower
 
01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
negative emotional response to
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
gender-based mistreatment and improved
 
01:29:57.530 --> 01:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
mental health outcomes among trans
 
01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:58.910 align:start position:0%
mental health outcomes among trans
populations

01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
populations
 
01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
improving access to official documents
 
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
that correctly represent one's gender
 
01:30:05.450 --> 01:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
identity is a matter of dignity and laws
 
01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
that make the process of amending and
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
correcting essential identification
 
01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
documents an equally burdensome for
 
01:30:13.129 --> 01:30:13.139 align:start position:0%
Trans individuals only functions to
 
01:30:15.470 --> 01:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
further marginalize this community
 
01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
a simple change to this process by
 
01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
passing HB 264 would enable Granite
 
01:30:22.729 --> 01:30:22.739 align:start position:0%
Staters to better control how their
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
gender is expressed and for that reason
 
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
the ACLU of New Hampshire requests the
 
01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
committee vote ought to pass on HB 264.
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for the from the
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative Nagel
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
um we have a question about the court
 
01:30:42.649 --> 01:30:42.659 align:start position:0%
process right now we've heard implied or
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
stated a couple times that that would
 
01:30:47.149 --> 01:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
require a surgical change for the court
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
to issue that order I'm looking at law
 
01:30:51.169 --> 01:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
here and I don't see that what what
 
01:30:54.370 --> 01:30:54.380 align:start position:0%
criteria does the court use now to to
 
01:30:56.810 --> 01:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
initiate that order
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your question from my
 
01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
understanding uh
 
01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
I don't believe a surgery is required
 
01:31:06.649 --> 01:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
but I can get back to you on that and I
 
01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
believe other individuals providing
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
testimony would be able to answer that
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
question more appropriately thank you
 
01:31:15.410 --> 01:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
a follow-up is there any place in law
 
01:31:18.169 --> 01:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
where it states what what criteria the
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
I could get back to you on that thank
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you other questions
 
01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you for providing this study
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking taking a quick look at
 
01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
the abstract and the methodologies it
 
01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
says that it's actually evaluating it
 
01:31:41.870 --> 01:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
based upon whether they've legally
 
01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
changed their name on their passport or
 
01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
driver's license and I'm under the
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
impression that we already have that in
 
01:31:48.890 --> 01:31:48.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and this bill is dealing
 
01:31:50.510 --> 01:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
with the birth certificate which is an
 
01:31:52.129 --> 01:31:52.139 align:start position:0%
important but different document could
 
01:31:54.830 --> 01:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
you clarify that for me please
 
01:31:56.450 --> 01:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
um I couldn't find a study relating to
 
01:32:01.010 --> 01:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
birth certificates but I think we could
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
classify birth certificates as being
 
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
another essential document related to
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
functioning in legal systems and gender
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
identity affirmation thank you thank you
 
01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.209 --> 01:32:17.219 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you very much
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%

through support education and advocacy
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Naomi New Hampshire I'm
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
here today to speak in support of HB
 
01:33:15.719 --> 01:33:18.110 align:start position:0%
here today to speak in support of HB
264.

01:33:18.110 --> 01:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
264.
 
01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
there's an emerging body of research
 
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
that shows that lgbtq individuals
 
01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
especially those who are transgender or
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
gender non-conforming are at an elevated
 
01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
risk for experiencing anxiety and
 
01:33:28.729 --> 01:33:28.739 align:start position:0%
depression and are more likely to
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
consider an attempt suicide than their
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
heterosexual or cisgender peers I've
 
01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
passed around a study from the Trevor
 
01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
Project relevant to New Hampshire lgbtq
 
01:33:40.510 --> 01:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
youth ages 13 to 24
 
01:33:45.169 --> 01:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
in 2022 and that showed that 39 of lgbtq
 
01:33:46.850 --> 01:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
Youth in New Hampshire seriously
 
01:33:49.010 --> 01:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
considered suicide last year and 10
 
01:33:51.770 --> 01:33:51.780 align:start position:0%
percent attempted it Beyond Beyond New
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as you heard from
 
01:33:55.610 --> 01:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
representative Cannon a 2020 study in
 
01:33:56.930 --> 01:33:56.940 align:start position:0%
the Journal of interpersonal violence
 
01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
found that 82 percent of transgender
 
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
individuals across the U.S and Canada
 
01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
have considered suicide and 40 have
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
attempted it
 
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
hormone therapy and gender affirming
 
01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
surgery alone can significantly decrease
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
the likelihood of psychological distress
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
but in addition trans mental health must
 
01:34:13.129 --> 01:34:13.139 align:start position:0%
be addressed socially within our
 
01:34:13.139 --> 01:34:14.090 align:start position:0%
be addressed socially within our
communities

01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
the journey Journal of interpersonal
 
01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
violence study found that school
 
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
belonging internalized stigma and
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
emotional familial neglect made a
 
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
significant contribution to suicidality
 
01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
for transgender individuals based on
 
01:34:26.450 --> 01:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
this data we believe that access to
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
Identity affirming spaces is one of the
 
01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
most significant ways we can promote
 
01:34:31.129 --> 01:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
trans well-being
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
you can see in that uh Trevor Trevor
 
01:34:35.810 --> 01:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
Project report that open representation
 
01:34:37.610 --> 01:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
and a welcoming environment have been
 
01:34:38.990 --> 01:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
identified as qualities that make a
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
space affirming for lgbtq youth in New
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these spaces are few and far
 
01:34:44.810 --> 01:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
between as evidenced by the fact that
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
only 18 percent of lgbtq Youth believe
 
01:34:51.229 --> 01:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
the community to be quote very accepting
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
by allowing for amendments to birth
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
records more easily this bill would
 
01:34:56.209 --> 01:34:56.219 align:start position:0%
would take an important step in making
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at large a supportive
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
environment for transgender individuals
 
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
better enabling them to obtain an
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
affirmative legal recognition of their
 
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
identity from the state we believe that
 
01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
this and similar efforts will help to
 
01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
improve the mental well-being of
 
01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:10.679 align:start position:0%
transgender individuals and decrease the
 
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
prevalence of anxiety depression and
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
suicide within the community for these
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
reasons we urge you to vote ought pass
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
for HB 264.
 
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you our questions
 
01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions of this
 
01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:25.310 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions of this
individual

01:35:25.310 --> 01:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
yes representative palazzov thank you Mr
 
01:35:31.450 --> 01:35:31.460 align:start position:0%
chairs thank you for taking my question
 
01:35:36.169 --> 01:35:36.179 align:start position:0%
uh I want to ask you about page six uh
 
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
so there is a graph that shows
 
01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
that for about five year period from age
 
01:35:46.510 --> 01:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
13 to 17
 
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
comparing to about seven years from
 
01:35:53.450 --> 01:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
18 to 24
 
01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
and a short that period has actually
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
like legit representation of 60 percent
 
01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
so does this graph means that
 
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
issues with transgender for some reason
 
01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
are happening twice as often
 
01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:14.219 align:start position:0%
as they will
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
in a little bit all the kids
 
01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you restart your
 
01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:19.490 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you restart your
question

01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:36:24.709 --> 01:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
so so there is a graph called h of lgbtq
 
01:36:24.719 --> 01:36:26.110 align:start position:0%
so so there is a graph called h of lgbtq
use

01:36:26.110 --> 01:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
use
 
01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:27.910 align:start position:0%
use
and

01:36:27.910 --> 01:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:30.250 --> 01:36:30.260 align:start position:0%
it says that
 
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
use from 13 to 17
 
01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:35.810 align:start position:0%
use from 13 to 17
has

01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
60 percent of
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
uh okay uh I'm withdrawing my question
 
01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
no okay thank you
 
01:36:59.810 --> 01:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
and taking the question just looking at
 
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
these different issues like School
 
01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
belonging the internalized stigma are
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
you do you believe that a change in
 
01:37:13.729 --> 01:37:13.739 align:start position:0%
these documents will change access to
 
01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
different spaces or is this simply just
 
01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
more of a welcoming accepting atmosphere
 
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
in your view
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question I believe
 
01:37:22.850 --> 01:37:22.860 align:start position:0%
it's both I believe better enabling
 
01:37:25.129 --> 01:37:25.139 align:start position:0%
people within the state to uh having the
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
state on their side
 
01:37:28.729 --> 01:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
um in in getting these documents uh and
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
better enabling them
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
would give a community sense of of
 
01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:35.580 align:start position:0%
belonging and acceptance within their
 
01:37:37.790 --> 01:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
identity we have also heard testimony
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
that there are situations where you're
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
required to present a document uh and
 
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
there would there are safety concerns
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
for transgender individuals uh that if
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
their identity is not represented in
 
01:37:49.729 --> 01:37:49.739 align:start position:0%
those documents they could be exposed to
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
violence so I think it's
 
01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:57.590 --> 01:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.050 --> 01:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
okay I see none so thank you very much
 
01:38:03.530 --> 01:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify this morning
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone my name is Bill
 
01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
Blum I currently live in Atkinson New
 
01:38:19.370 --> 01:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am a transgender non-binary
 
01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:20.570 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am a transgender non-binary
individual

01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
my journey started at a young age when I
 
01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:26.580 align:start position:0%
was a teenager I realized I was the
 
01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
quilt Lady Gaga Born This Way
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
I was not living a genuine life
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
at the time I was afraid to tell my
 
01:38:38.209 --> 01:38:38.219 align:start position:0%
story I lived in an unsupported area
 
01:38:40.490 --> 01:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
and just kept quiet
 
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
I got married moved to Portsmouth New
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire really started coming out of
 
01:38:46.370 --> 01:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
my shell if you will really started
 
01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:47.830 align:start position:0%
my shell if you will really started
exploring

01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
exploring
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
that led to the timeline in May of 2022
 
01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
I walked into the DMV in Dover and
 
01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
changed my gender to non-binary that
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
when I renew my license
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
in September of 2022 I was fired from my
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
job without cause there were no
 
01:39:06.590 --> 01:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
supporting paperwork they simply
 
01:39:09.290 --> 01:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
eliminated my position
 
01:39:12.050 --> 01:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
in January of 2023
 
01:39:15.410 --> 01:39:15.420 align:start position:0%
on the first Monday of last month I
 
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
moved out of my home
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
and in February
 
01:39:22.129 --> 01:39:22.139 align:start position:0%
this month in less than two weeks I am
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
starting the mediation process to go
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
through a divorce
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
why am I telling you this story
 
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you the story to tell you
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
the story about transgendered
 
01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:33.590 align:start position:0%
the story about transgendered
individuals

01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
being transgendered yes is a noun
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
as a definition but it to me it's a verb
 
01:39:41.810 --> 01:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
it's an action that I am taking I am on
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
a journey
 
01:39:44.930 --> 01:39:44.940 align:start position:0%
where where does that Journey end I'm
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
not sure does that Journey end going all
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
the way to the female side of things
 
01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:52.620 align:start position:0%
does that Journey end going to
 
01:39:55.310 --> 01:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
getting onto hormones does that jury end
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
with sexual reassignment surgery
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
that last option is not applicable to me
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
or available to me right now because I
 
01:40:06.110 --> 01:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
am also still unemployed
 
01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:07.430 align:start position:0%
am also still unemployed
I

01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
in the professional world I've used to
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
document I onboarded people at for a job
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
I hired over 50 people
 
01:40:22.129 --> 01:40:22.139 align:start position:0%
thus processed i-9s you simply needed a
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
driver's license and a passport if you
 
01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
didn't have that birth certificate
 
01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
worked too
 
01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire recognizes
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
its ability to change your driver's
 
01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
license is pretty cut and dry the
 
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
ability to change your passport is not
 
01:40:39.169 --> 01:40:39.179 align:start position:0%
the federal government that's pretty cut
 
01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
and dry
 
01:40:40.679 --> 01:40:42.470 align:start position:0%
and dry
um

01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
as a data person I find it challenging
 
01:40:48.669 --> 01:40:48.679 align:start position:0%
that all of the documentation
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
is not in the same regards as far as the
 
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.110 align:start position:0%
is not in the same regards as far as the
process

01:40:54.110 --> 01:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
if I want to end my transition by fully
 
01:40:59.689 --> 01:40:59.699 align:start position:0%
having all my paperwork reflect my true
 
01:40:59.699 --> 01:41:01.610 align:start position:0%
having all my paperwork reflect my true
gender

01:41:01.610 --> 01:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
gender
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't feel that there should
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
be any roadblocks financially or
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
otherwise that will get in the way
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
speak about the question about
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
mental health issues within the
 
01:41:15.649 --> 01:41:15.659 align:start position:0%
transgender community
 
01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:17.940 align:start position:0%
um yes this bill might not prevent all
 
01:41:17.940 --> 01:41:19.550 align:start position:0%
um yes this bill might not prevent all
suicides

01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
suicides
 
01:41:21.290 --> 01:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
um if
 
01:41:24.050 --> 01:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
if we simply do nothing
 
01:41:25.790 --> 01:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
we're not going to prevent anything
 
01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
but if we make this change
 
01:41:30.649 --> 01:41:30.659 align:start position:0%
this might make just one person
 
01:41:32.689 --> 01:41:32.699 align:start position:0%
complete and whole
 
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
because I truly believe
 
01:41:37.370 --> 01:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
in living a whole and truthful and
 
01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
genuine life
 
01:41:41.570 --> 01:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
and at what cost to me
 
01:41:43.490 --> 01:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter at this point I've
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
already lost a lot
 
01:41:48.530 --> 01:41:48.540 align:start position:0%

01:42:45.649 --> 01:42:45.659 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
um so there's a lot of confusion about
 
01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
the process that currently exists and I
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
think you've heard some of that today I
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that what is proposed
 
01:42:57.410 --> 01:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
in the bill is not a change in the
 
01:43:00.590 --> 01:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
standard of what's required to obtain a
 
01:43:02.689 --> 01:43:02.699 align:start position:0%
new birth certificate all that's changed
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
there's a all that's changing if this
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
bill becomes law is a change to the
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
process it's more efficient and it's
 
01:43:10.910 --> 01:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
less wasteful
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
um just to say that I have never heard
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
of a person being able to obtain one of
 
01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:16.380 align:start position:0%
these court orders without hiring a
 
01:43:19.490 --> 01:43:19.500 align:start position:0%
lawyer I've never heard I mean and of
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
course you know every time you go to the
 
01:43:22.609 --> 01:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
court it requires uh you know
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
administrative costs with the court
 
01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
filing a petition
 
01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
Etc asking a judge to take time out of
 
01:43:30.050 --> 01:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
that judge's day to make an assessment
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
of something that the judge typically
 
01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
isn't really equipped to assess anyway
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
so of course the judge is relying on
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
what the doctors say and um which is
 
01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
which is what the bill would do and so
 
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
it's just a it's just an administrative
 
01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
nightmare that doesn't have to happen to
 
01:43:46.550 --> 01:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
go to records used resources Etc to
 
01:43:49.390 --> 01:43:49.400 align:start position:0%
obtain this petition and it's expensive
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
also it creates a lot of problems for
 
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
people especially people who are born in
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
other states but need to obtain I'm
 
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
sorry born in New Hampshire but live in
 
01:44:00.229 --> 01:44:00.239 align:start position:0%
other states and need to obtain a court
 
01:44:02.689 --> 01:44:02.699 align:start position:0%
order from their home where the court is
 
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
like well we don't have that requirement
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
in our in our state so we don't know how
 
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
to when we don't know what we're
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to do and so it creates yet
 
01:44:10.010 --> 01:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
another set of obstacles whereas if
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
there are administrative process in New
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that person wouldn't have to
 
01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
go to their home State's court system to
 
01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
try to get an order to deal with it
 
01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
um I um want to speak to something that
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
rep Leon Leon has asked about
 
01:44:26.209 --> 01:44:26.219 align:start position:0%
um about what birth certificates mean in
 
01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
terms of access to sex separated
 
01:44:30.590 --> 01:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
facilities in different and programs and
 
01:44:33.890 --> 01:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
different contexts and um no New
 
01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh state government related uh
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
programmer activity relies exclusively
 
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
on birth certificates to determine
 
01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
placement for and that's true the New
 
01:44:47.450 --> 01:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire inner Scholastic Athletics
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
Association does not even mention birth
 
01:44:53.149 --> 01:44:53.159 align:start position:0%
certificates in its standards and the
 
01:44:55.669 --> 01:44:55.679 align:start position:0%
doc would probably view a birth
 
01:44:57.649 --> 01:44:57.659 align:start position:0%
certificate as strong evidence of where
 
01:44:59.209 --> 01:44:59.219 align:start position:0%
someone should be placed but there is
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely no place where anyone relies
 
01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:05.219 align:start position:0%
exclusively on what is um on what is on
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
a birth certificate or a driver's
 
01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
license for that matter
 
01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:10.199 align:start position:0%
um on the other hand uh private
 
01:45:12.530 --> 01:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
facilities private institutions have the
 
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
right to to make their own
 
01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:14.820 align:start position:0%
determinations about how they would
 
01:45:17.689 --> 01:45:17.699 align:start position:0%
divide people into sex categories based
 
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
on documentation so that I hope that
 
01:45:21.530 --> 01:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
answers that question the language
 
01:45:23.450 --> 01:45:23.460 align:start position:0%
that's in the current statute is
 
01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
outdated and it leads to confusion as
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
you've heard today I don't think any
 
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
judge in New Hampshire today in the in
 
01:45:30.649 --> 01:45:30.659 align:start position:0%
the probate courts requires
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
um requires any kind of surgical
 
01:45:34.609 --> 01:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
procedure or even proof of any other
 
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
medical procedure or treatment instead
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
they require a letter from a doctor that
 
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
says that somebody has completed
 
01:45:42.649 --> 01:45:42.659 align:start position:0%
transition to the gender that they're CL
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
you know asking to be identified as and
 
01:45:45.239 --> 01:45:46.250 align:start position:0%
you know asking to be identified as and
so

01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:45:49.370 --> 01:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
um fortunately judges are consistent in
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire judges are great in New
 
01:45:52.490 --> 01:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as you probably already know
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
um the problem the problem is that
 
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of confusion that people
 
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily understand what the
 
01:45:58.850 --> 01:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
standard is and then even to go and
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
access that standard you got to hire a
 
01:46:01.970 --> 01:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
lawyer you got to pay for to file a
 
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
petition and equity in the in the court
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
it is just um it's just very taxing a
 
01:46:07.729 --> 01:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
lot of people don't even know it could
 
01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
begin wrapping up sir
 
01:46:11.689 --> 01:46:11.699 align:start position:0%
sure okay so the one thing that I want
 
01:46:11.699 --> 01:46:12.470 align:start position:0%
sure okay so the one thing that I want
to

01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
um also know is that the fiscal note
 
01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
um I I it's for the fiscal note speaks
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
to a process that already exists people
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
can change their birth records
 
01:46:24.410 --> 01:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
um through the court order system I'm
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
not quite sure what it is I don't want
 
01:46:27.410 --> 01:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
to question what Vital Records is asking
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
for on the fiscal note but I would ask
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
that if they are updating their software
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
um I think that it would be prudent for
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
them to also accommodate other uh other
 
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
markers besides mnf and I'm happy to
 
01:46:41.810 --> 01:46:41.820 align:start position:0%
take questions thank you
 
01:46:44.209 --> 01:46:44.219 align:start position:0%
question just representative Nagel
 
01:46:46.430 --> 01:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
testimony I have two questions
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm frustrated by that you would need
 
01:46:52.850 --> 01:46:52.860 align:start position:0%
an attorney for this but what is the
 
01:46:55.370 --> 01:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
cost to an individual to go through this
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
process and secondarily what's the time
 
01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.370 align:start position:0%
process and secondarily what's the time
frame

01:46:58.370 --> 01:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
frame
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a good question so um I
 
01:47:02.689 --> 01:47:02.699 align:start position:0%
believe and I you know you can't quote
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
me on this I believe that the full cost
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
to file petition and Equity is somewhere
 
01:47:07.370 --> 01:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
around three hundred dollars
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
um the cost to file a name change
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
petition is much less and judges will
 
01:47:13.609 --> 01:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
typically allow you if you're in the
 
01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
know they'll allow you to you know tack
 
01:47:17.629 --> 01:47:17.639 align:start position:0%
on emotion onto that petition without
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
filing a whole new petition so the cost
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
could be relatively low you can also get
 
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
indigency waivers if you can't afford to
 
01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
pay the cost but again you have to know
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
that that's an option available to you
 
01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
and many attorneys will do this work for
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
free other attorneys will do this work
 
01:47:32.750 --> 01:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
for a fee and that varies from from
 
01:47:35.450 --> 01:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
person to person the time
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
um gosh if everything goes really really
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
smoothly I think you can get get the
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
whole thing done in a in about a month
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
um but that but that's you know I've
 
01:47:45.890 --> 01:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
seen it take many months and multiple
 
01:47:47.930 --> 01:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
Court visits because uh you know someone
 
01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
will come to court with having a letter
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
where where the wording is unclear to
 
01:47:52.910 --> 01:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
the judge and so the judge says can you
 
01:47:54.350 --> 01:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
ask your doctor to get a more direct
 
01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
letter uh and then you go and you get it
 
01:47:57.950 --> 01:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
and then you know that just adds another
 
01:47:59.330 --> 01:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
month to the whole process so that's
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
typically what I see does that answer
 
01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:02.639 align:start position:0%
your question thank you
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
I represented a merchant
 
01:48:09.530 --> 01:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman also thank you for
 
01:48:11.450 --> 01:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:13.070 align:start position:0%
taking my question
so

01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:15.410 --> 01:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
a citizen of New Hampshire
 
01:48:17.209 --> 01:48:17.219 align:start position:0%
who was born in another state because
 
01:48:18.350 --> 01:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
this came up with the Department of
 
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
Corrections DLC so if I was born in Mass
 
01:48:25.609 --> 01:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
but now reside in New Hampshire become
 
01:48:25.619 --> 01:48:26.810 align:start position:0%
but now reside in New Hampshire become
incarcerated

01:48:26.810 --> 01:48:26.820 align:start position:0%
incarcerated
 
01:48:28.490 --> 01:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to prevent me from going
 
01:48:30.649 --> 01:48:30.659 align:start position:0%
back to mass with my birth certificate
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
can be changed
 
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
this is only talking about people born
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
so yeah in other words if I'm
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
help me understand you go back to the
 
01:48:43.010 --> 01:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
state in which you were born to change
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
your birth certificate correct not the
 
01:48:47.930 --> 01:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
state in which you reside
 
01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
well right it's a vital records
 
01:48:51.229 --> 01:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
department typically in a state that
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
issues a birth certificate and there
 
01:48:55.010 --> 01:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
though they would allow you to you know
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
be where you go to change it sure
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up sure so what I'm trying to
 
01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
understand is if I was born in the state
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts
 
01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
but I reside in New Hampshire
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
I can go back to mass and change my
 
01:49:11.570 --> 01:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
birth certificate using the form within
 
01:49:11.580 --> 01:49:12.770 align:start position:0%
birth certificate using the form within
Mass

01:49:12.770 --> 01:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
Mass
 
01:49:15.950 --> 01:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
so therefore if I'm incarcerated
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
going back to the DLC
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to go back to the birth
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
certificate that they have in
 
01:49:23.689 --> 01:49:23.699 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts not how I stand within New
 
01:49:23.699 --> 01:49:24.709 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts not how I stand within New
Hampshire

01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify if I understand your
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
question correctly a person who is
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
formerly incarcerated in New Hampshire
 
01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
can get a birth certificate without
 
01:49:34.129 --> 01:49:34.139 align:start position:0%
going through any court process in
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that changes the gender
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
marker on that birth certificate as long
 
01:49:39.290 --> 01:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
as they're born in Massachusetts and
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's true that's true regardless of
 
01:49:42.830 --> 01:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
this bill of course but yes it's true um
 
01:49:44.450 --> 01:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
to change your name though
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
um on a birth certificate or to get a
 
01:49:48.350 --> 01:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
legal name change in Massachusetts or in
 
01:49:50.570 --> 01:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you will still need to go
 
01:49:52.189 --> 01:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
through a court process that evaluates
 
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
for things to make sure there's no
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
improper purpose
 
01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
um you know for for changing your name
 
01:49:59.570 --> 01:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
so that a transgender person who is
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
formerly incarcerated will have to
 
01:50:02.570 --> 01:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that no I'm not doing this
 
01:50:04.129 --> 01:50:04.139 align:start position:0%
because I want to hide my identity I'm
 
01:50:06.649 --> 01:50:06.659 align:start position:0%
doing this because I uh you know want to
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
reflect who I am
 
01:50:12.590 --> 01:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:14.689 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:50:14.689 --> 01:50:14.699 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have two quick
 
01:50:18.050 --> 01:50:18.060 align:start position:0%
questions with your Indulgence sure
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:21.890 --> 01:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
um so my first question
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
um you you clarified that this is a
 
01:50:27.290 --> 01:50:27.300 align:start position:0%
matter of process not the standard and I
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
think it might make sense to have
 
01:50:31.729 --> 01:50:31.739 align:start position:0%
harmonized documents I'm just kind of
 
01:50:33.950 --> 01:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
wondering from a history perspective why
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
in 2005 when we created this initial
 
01:50:41.770 --> 01:50:41.780 align:start position:0%
process was the birth certificate
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
differentiated from these other
 
01:50:46.850 --> 01:50:46.860 align:start position:0%
documents in terms of having to go
 
01:50:49.010 --> 01:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
through the court process why was that
 
01:50:50.990 --> 01:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
kind of set apart that's that's a really
 
01:50:52.129 --> 01:50:52.139 align:start position:0%
good question
 
01:50:53.510 --> 01:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately I can only speculate
 
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
because I've only been doing this work
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
for four years and not you know not not
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
20 years um but um my understanding is
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
that Vital Records departments are often
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
really hesitant to adopt any kind of
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
changes to birth records because of the
 
01:51:08.930 --> 01:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
importance that those administrations
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
place on what you know what what a
 
01:51:13.729 --> 01:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
record actually represents today I think
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
that there's a much better understanding
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
among Vital Records departments across
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
the country and I don't mean to speak
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
for Vital Records here but that day
 
01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
databases are actually where information
 
01:51:24.590 --> 01:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
is stored and that you know and this
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
this bill does nothing to change you
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
know how vital records stores
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
information and that a piece of paper is
 
01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
really a piece of documentation that
 
01:51:32.810 --> 01:51:32.820 align:start position:0%
someone uses to navigate tricky
 
01:51:34.490 --> 01:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
situations in life does that answer your
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you and my and my
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
second question just quickly
 
01:51:39.290 --> 01:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the lady from the
 
01:51:41.390 --> 01:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office had only
 
01:51:43.729 --> 01:51:43.739 align:start position:0%
been here two months so I'm just trying
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
to understand it seems like a lot of
 
01:51:47.209 --> 01:51:47.219 align:start position:0%
unders other states have gone to this
 
01:51:49.490 --> 01:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
more streamlined process and I'm just
 
01:51:52.250 --> 01:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
trying to get a feel it hasn't been a
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
smooth process or have there been any
 
01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:55.990 align:start position:0%
smooth process or have there been any
observed

01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
observed
 
01:51:58.430 --> 01:51:58.440 align:start position:0%
consequences from that that might want
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
to be explored yeah so there's one
 
01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:01.860 align:start position:0%
consequence which I kind of alluded to
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
earlier which is that um when you reside
 
01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts right now but you were
 
01:52:09.050 --> 01:52:09.060 align:start position:0%
born in New Hampshire trying to convince
 
01:52:10.609 --> 01:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
the Massachusetts courts that they have
 
01:52:12.350 --> 01:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
to issue a court order when they're they
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
don't see these on a with any regularity
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
is really is really
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
um perplexing for them and you have to
 
01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
like really go in and convince a judge
 
01:52:20.930 --> 01:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
that it's so that's one downside that
 
01:52:22.850 --> 01:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
can arise from it you know
 
01:52:25.129 --> 01:52:25.139 align:start position:0%
um uh and you know so if someone say
 
01:52:28.129 --> 01:52:28.139 align:start position:0%
Ohio Ohio requires court orders if
 
01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
somebody was born in Ohio but lives in
 
01:52:32.209 --> 01:52:32.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the courts after you if
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
the law were to change the courts might
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
be like oh we don't know if we can do
 
01:52:37.070 --> 01:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
this and then you know it might be a
 
01:52:38.510 --> 01:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
little bit extra work to try to convince
 
01:52:40.250 --> 01:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
the judge that you know the judge does
 
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
in fact have power to issue this order
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
for the Ohio Vital Records that's what I
 
01:52:46.729 --> 01:52:46.739 align:start position:0%
see as the the major downside
 
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Leon um
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
thank you this is actually just a quick
 
01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
question could you email me your
 
01:52:53.570 --> 01:52:53.580 align:start position:0%

would love to have one oh yeah I have an
 
01:52:56.450 --> 01:52:56.460 align:start position:0%

see no other questions thank you very
 
01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:10.669 align:start position:0%
see no other questions thank you very
much

01:53:10.669 --> 01:53:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:12.890 --> 01:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
the final a person who signed up to
 
01:53:16.729 --> 01:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
testify this morning is Lynn's jackows
 
01:53:19.189 --> 01:53:19.199 align:start position:0%

01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
Lynn Kaus and I live I live in Dover I
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
am a founder of 603 equality which is
 
01:53:32.510 --> 01:53:32.520 align:start position:0%

and I strongly support HB 254.
 
01:53:43.729 --> 01:53:43.739 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned birth certificates
 
01:53:45.649 --> 01:53:45.659 align:start position:0%
serve as proof of an individual's age
 
01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
citizenship status and identity and are
 
01:53:50.270 --> 01:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
often necessary to obtain a social
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
security number apply for a passport
 
01:53:55.070 --> 01:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
enroll in schools get a driver's license
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
and apply for other benefits including
 
01:53:58.490 --> 01:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
health insurance
 
01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
being forced to show a birth certificate
 
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
that outs a person as trans can be a
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
barrier to all those opportunities it
 
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
can trigger dysphoria the significant
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
distress caused by misalignment of a
 
01:54:10.250 --> 01:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
trans person's gender and how that
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
person is seen or treated in some cases
 
01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
being forced to reveal a trans identity
 
01:54:16.430 --> 01:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
can open up people to discrimination or
 
01:54:18.770 --> 01:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
violence I've recently spoken to a
 
01:54:20.689 --> 01:54:20.699 align:start position:0%
Health Market connect Navigator who may
 
01:54:22.609 --> 01:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
have emailed you testimony who
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
specifically helps lgbtq people get
 
01:54:26.209 --> 01:54:26.219 align:start position:0%
health insurance through the exchange
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
Medicare or Medicaid who really hates it
 
01:54:31.010 --> 01:54:31.020 align:start position:0%
she has to ask trans people for the
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
gender marker on their birth certificate
 
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
and open themselves up that way she sees
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
the fear and discomfort in their eyes
 
01:54:38.570 --> 01:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
even though of course she's going to
 
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
help them no matter what
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
like everyone trans people face many
 
01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
different factors that impact our mental
 
01:54:46.609 --> 01:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
health we may not be able to arrive at
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
an exact percentage of trans-suicides
 
01:54:50.810 --> 01:54:50.820 align:start position:0%
averted if this bill were to pass but
 
01:54:52.070 --> 01:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's easy to see how this gender
 
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
affirmation is one factor that will
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
benefit trans people's mental health and
 
01:54:55.679 --> 01:54:56.870 align:start position:0%
benefit trans people's mental health and
well-being

01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'm currently as Chris Herschel
 
01:55:01.129 --> 01:55:01.139 align:start position:0%
explained the process can be really time
 
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
consuming involving taking time off work
 
01:55:05.689 --> 01:55:05.699 align:start position:0%
and even more time if someone for
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
example files a name change petition
 
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
before the gender marker petition
 
01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:11.820 align:start position:0%
causing the name change petition to be
 
01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:13.010 align:start position:0%
causing the name change petition to be
reopened

01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
reopened
 
01:55:15.709 --> 01:55:15.719 align:start position:0%
and please support streamlining this
 
01:55:18.290 --> 01:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
process and extend dignity and respect
 
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
to transgender people by voting ought to
 
01:55:21.729 --> 01:55:21.739 align:start position:0%
pass on HB
 
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
254. thank you 264 actually 264. even
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%

01:55:33.890 --> 01:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
um so as a person who identifies as they
 
01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
them a non-binary what does this look
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
like for you then so I would like to see
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
a bill that allows um people to update a
 
01:55:48.770 --> 01:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
birth certificate to an ex at some point
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
I understand you know the intention was
 
01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
to pass a more binary a bill first
 
01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:00.719 align:start position:0%
um or I updated my gender marker on my
 
01:56:02.330 --> 01:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
driver's license when that became
 
01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:05.940 align:start position:0%
possible in 2019 so I have an X gender
 
01:56:08.689 --> 01:56:08.699 align:start position:0%
marker on my driver's license I do not
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
have an X gender marker on my birth
 
01:56:12.169 --> 01:56:12.179 align:start position:0%
certificate since that's not possible
 
01:56:15.410 --> 01:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
but I hope that for some day for uh you
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
know it was really affirming for me to
 
01:56:21.169 --> 01:56:21.179 align:start position:0%
have a document that shows my gender as
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
I understand it and
 
01:56:25.850 --> 01:56:25.860 align:start position:0%
um many people would like to do the same
 
01:56:28.010 --> 01:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
with birth certificates and make acts a
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
possibility on a birth certificate so I
 
01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
would like to see a bill maybe next year
 
01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.129 --> 01:56:37.139 align:start position:0%

next year doing this again to extend
 
01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
what things are we want our birth
 
01:56:57.649 --> 01:56:57.659 align:start position:0%
certificates to
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
what we what we would be able to do with
 
01:57:03.169 --> 01:57:03.179 align:start position:0%
our birth birth certificates and
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
and to what extent can can people change
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
other things
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
besides sex on their birth certificates
 
01:57:14.149 --> 01:57:14.159 align:start position:0%
like is that coming
 
01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:16.739 align:start position:0%
um I don't I've never heard anybody you
 
01:57:18.830 --> 01:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
know make a case for changing anything
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
other than a gender marker on a birth
 
01:57:26.330 --> 01:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
certificate so I'm not sure or what else
 
01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:27.169 align:start position:0%
certificate so I'm not sure or what else
um

01:57:27.169 --> 01:57:27.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:30.109 --> 01:57:30.119 align:start position:0%
would be involved but I would I would
 
01:57:32.209 --> 01:57:32.219 align:start position:0%
definitely like to I don't necessarily
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%

for other people that would feel
 
01:57:43.250 --> 01:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
affirmed by that

I've passed around on one side a copy a
 
01:59:48.169 --> 01:59:48.179 align:start position:0%
written copy of my testimony and on the
 
01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
other side a letter uh to the committee
 
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
that was written by a child care
 
01:59:55.250 --> 01:59:55.260 align:start position:0%
provider in my district who was not able
 
01:59:58.370 --> 01:59:58.380 align:start position:0%

02:00:01.129 --> 02:00:01.139 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak in favor of five six
 
02:00:06.830 --> 02:00:06.840 align:start position:0%

um and again I thank you for hearing my
 
02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
testimony the purpose of the bill as you
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
can see is to create a child care
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development Fund to administer
 
02:00:17.209 --> 02:00:17.219 align:start position:0%
signing and retention bonuses to child
 
02:00:19.250 --> 02:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
care workers in New Hampshire
 
02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
we are all well aware of the dramatic
 
02:00:22.850 --> 02:00:22.860 align:start position:0%
shortage of child care workers in the
 
02:00:25.129 --> 02:00:25.139 align:start position:0%
state with well-documented consequences
 
02:00:27.169 --> 02:00:27.179 align:start position:0%
for the economic well-being of Granite
 
02:00:29.209 --> 02:00:29.219 align:start position:0%
State families and communities
 
02:00:31.250 --> 02:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu has listed addressing
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
this shortage as one of his top
 
02:00:34.970 --> 02:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
priorities for this biennium and speaker
 
02:00:37.070 --> 02:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
Packard as we know has created the
 
02:00:38.689 --> 02:00:38.699 align:start position:0%
special house committee to explore
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
productive bipartisan Solutions
 
02:00:45.229 --> 02:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the issues facing our
 
02:00:46.850 --> 02:00:46.860 align:start position:0%
state around child care we talk about
 
02:00:49.609 --> 02:00:49.619 align:start position:0%
affordability and accessibility
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
all too often however these two
 
02:00:54.770 --> 02:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
desirables are at odds with each other
 
02:00:56.450 --> 02:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
achieving the goal of affordability
 
02:00:58.790 --> 02:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
requires that we keep the cost of child
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
care down ideally at seven percent of a
 
02:01:05.270 --> 02:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
family's income or less
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
the way this is usually achieved is by
 
02:01:09.169 --> 02:01:09.179 align:start position:0%
paying low wages to the women and men
 
02:01:11.450 --> 02:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
who deliver this vital service
 
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
in my region of the state
 
02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:16.679 align:start position:0%
the average preschool educator enters
 
02:01:20.330 --> 02:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
the field making 13.51 an hour and an
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
experienced Early Childhood educator
 
02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
makes on average
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
1751 an hour this works out to twenty
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
eight thousand dollars a year and just
 
02:01:32.169 --> 02:01:32.179 align:start position:0%
over thirty six thousand dollars a year
 
02:01:34.430 --> 02:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
respectively in a state where the
 
02:01:37.010 --> 02:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
average cost of living is around fifty
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars as of December 2021
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
no doubt considerably higher now
 
02:01:46.850 --> 02:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
to give you a more personal example my
 
02:01:49.609 --> 02:01:49.619 align:start position:0%
wife has been working in the field as an
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
early childhood educator for more than
 
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
25 years and she has two college degrees
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
an Associates in early childhood
 
02:01:57.169 --> 02:01:57.179 align:start position:0%
development and a bachelor's in
 
02:01:59.750 --> 02:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
developmental psychology she recently
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
became a co-director of Accenture in
 
02:02:05.149 --> 02:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
Brattleboro and for the first time in
 
02:02:07.850 --> 02:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
her career she is making just over forty
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:02:11.689 --> 02:02:11.699 align:start position:0%
25 years of working in the profession
 
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
with two college degrees and she's still
 
02:02:16.490 --> 02:02:16.500 align:start position:0%
earning less than ten thousand dollars a
 
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
year than the average cost of living in
 
02:02:20.209 --> 02:02:20.219 align:start position:0%
this state
 
02:02:23.030 --> 02:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
our 19 year old son who has taken time
 
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
off from college to learn business from
 
02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
the inside is currently the manager of
 
02:02:29.450 --> 02:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
the Jersey Mike's restaurant in
 
02:02:32.450 --> 02:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
Manchester I highly recommend it and
 
02:02:35.209 --> 02:02:35.219 align:start position:0%
last year he made almost twice as much
 
02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
as his mother
 
02:02:39.370 --> 02:02:39.380 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't begrudge him that pay
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
frankly I'm really happy he can pay his
 
02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
own bills
 
02:02:46.070 --> 02:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
he works extremely hard and has proven
 
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
proven himself to be immensely valuable
 
02:02:51.129 --> 02:02:51.139 align:start position:0%
to his employers but what does this say
 
02:02:53.870 --> 02:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
about how much we value the people who
 
02:02:56.030 --> 02:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
help nurture our children and keep them
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
safe every day the people who Comfort
 
02:03:01.070 --> 02:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
them when we cannot and prepare them for
 
02:03:02.930 --> 02:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
the academic and emotional challenges
 
02:03:05.810 --> 02:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
over the early school years
 
02:03:07.970 --> 02:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
as important what does this mean for the
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
future economic Vitality of New
 
02:03:12.410 --> 02:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families and communities
 
02:03:14.810 --> 02:03:14.820 align:start position:0%
as you will read in the online testimony
 
02:03:18.169 --> 02:03:18.179 align:start position:0%
and hear from in-person testimony the
 
02:03:20.209 --> 02:03:20.219 align:start position:0%
child care Workforce shortage in our
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
state has a serious economic impact
 
02:03:26.030 --> 02:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
many Granite Staters the overwhelming
 
02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
majority of whom are women have either
 
02:03:30.649 --> 02:03:30.659 align:start position:0%
involuntarily left the workforce to take
 
02:03:32.570 --> 02:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
care of children because of the lack of
 
02:03:34.729 --> 02:03:34.739 align:start position:0%
accessible affordable child care options
 
02:03:37.729 --> 02:03:37.739 align:start position:0%
or are forced to work fewer hours than
 
02:03:39.229 --> 02:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
they would like
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
the research done for SP 446 from the
 
02:03:45.010 --> 02:03:45.020 align:start position:0%
last session
 
02:03:48.229 --> 02:03:48.239 align:start position:0%

1.3 percent increase in Workforce

participation by women
 
02:04:00.649 --> 02:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 25 and 54 made
 
02:04:02.470 --> 02:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
possible by an increase in available
 
02:04:05.330 --> 02:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
availability of child care would yield
 
02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
an additional one billion dollars for
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's GDP

identified the lack of affordable and
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%

businesses ability to recruit and retain
 
02:04:39.890 --> 02:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
a Workforce is the lack of accessible

and affordable child care without access
 
02:04:44.930 --> 02:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
to quality affordable child care for
 
02:04:47.450 --> 02:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
their workers businesses are unable to

their potential for economic success
 
02:04:57.830 --> 02:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan issue as we all
 
02:05:00.830 --> 02:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
know across the country and here in New
 
02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:03.119 align:start position:0%

families and communities
 
02:05:39.890 --> 02:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
building this vital Workforce means
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
compensating the workers and treating
 
02:05:44.689 --> 02:05:44.699 align:start position:0%

on families
 
02:05:59.209 --> 02:05:59.219 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
02:06:01.790 --> 02:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
consideration and I'm happy to answer
 
02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you representative
 
02:06:06.950 --> 02:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
on questions
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative Nagel
 
02:06:11.689 --> 02:06:11.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:06:14.089 --> 02:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm I'm curious
 
02:06:16.129 --> 02:06:16.139 align:start position:0%
um do you have data about uh the
 
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
turnover rate for employees and you've
 
02:06:20.510 --> 02:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
you've specified between child care
 
02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:22.500 align:start position:0%
worker and child care educator I'm
 
02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
impressed your wife stayed in the field
 
02:06:26.689 --> 02:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
that long but what's the turnover rate
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
because that'll have a huge effect on
 
02:06:32.089 --> 02:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
this bonus structure here
 
02:06:34.970 --> 02:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
uh I do not have that information I we
 
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
have some uh providers here today who
 
02:06:39.770 --> 02:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
will give you uh some I think good
 
02:06:43.129 --> 02:06:43.139 align:start position:0%
concrete answers to that question
 
02:06:47.390 --> 02:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you all set representative McLean
 
02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
02:06:53.810 --> 02:06:53.820 align:start position:0%
you know while I agree that child care
 
02:06:56.450 --> 02:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
issues is very important and certainly
 
02:06:58.970 --> 02:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
increasing the workforce participation
 
02:07:01.850 --> 02:07:01.860 align:start position:0%
would be huge just looking at how this
 
02:07:04.430 --> 02:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
is structured once you're into it it
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
looks like you're giving a three
 
02:07:08.510 --> 02:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar bonus every fifth year
 
02:07:12.410 --> 02:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
and so I'm just wondering how that was
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%
arrived at because I really question its
 
02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
ability to really do what it's promising
 
02:07:19.129 --> 02:07:19.139 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
um in terms of being able to retain
 
02:07:22.490 --> 02:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
someone based on what you're describing
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
about your wife
 
02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
three thousand bucks every five years is
 
02:07:27.410 --> 02:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
not something that would kind of Turn Me
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
On a lot you know what I'm saying so
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
your thoughts yes thank you I very much
 
02:07:35.089 --> 02:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the question uh and uh I
 
02:07:37.490 --> 02:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
certainly would like to see it uh be
 
02:07:40.129 --> 02:07:40.139 align:start position:0%
significantly higher uh in terms of the
 
02:07:42.890 --> 02:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
bonus structure there are also uh some
 
02:07:45.770 --> 02:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
other uh there's other legislation uh
 
02:07:48.050 --> 02:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
that would make bonuses uh annual and
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
would amount over that five-year period
 
02:07:51.770 --> 02:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
to to a larger amount so I agree that
 
02:07:55.790 --> 02:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
there are uh this number could be higher
 
02:07:57.229 --> 02:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
and there's a different way to structure
 
02:07:59.089 --> 02:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
it the reason why I structured it to try
 
02:08:01.070 --> 02:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
to answer your question uh the reason
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
why I structured it the way I did had to
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
do largely with again thinking about
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
personal experience and if over that
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
time at six months and then three years
 
02:08:11.270 --> 02:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
and five years and every five years if
 
02:08:12.830 --> 02:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
my wife had received twenty five hundred
 
02:08:15.410 --> 02:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
or three thousand dollars that's money
 
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
that our family could have used for
 
02:08:19.129 --> 02:08:19.139 align:start position:0%
family vacation it's money we could have
 
02:08:21.770 --> 02:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
used to pre-buy oil for example for the
 
02:08:24.169 --> 02:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
winter so that was my thinking behind
 
02:08:26.209 --> 02:08:26.219 align:start position:0%
creating this particular structure I
 
02:08:27.649 --> 02:08:27.659 align:start position:0%
think there are lots of ways to do it
 
02:08:30.410 --> 02:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
but to answer your question as I crafted
 
02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
this legislation that was my thinking
 
02:08:35.689 --> 02:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
about spacing it out over uh
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
three years to five years as I said
 
02:08:39.649 --> 02:08:39.659 align:start position:0%
there are other ways to do it making it
 
02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
annually or quarterly for example
 
02:08:43.669 --> 02:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:49.010 --> 02:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and those thank
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
 
02:08:50.639 --> 02:08:52.129 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
I

02:08:52.129 --> 02:08:52.139 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
I totally understand where you're coming
 
02:08:55.850 --> 02:08:55.860 align:start position:0%
from with Workforce participation it's
 
02:08:57.709 --> 02:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
critical based upon what you just said
 
02:09:00.109 --> 02:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
here in your testimony a 1.3 percent
 
02:09:02.689 --> 02:09:02.699 align:start position:0%
increase uh the women part of the
 
02:09:05.390 --> 02:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
workforce would increase the GDP of the
 
02:09:08.410 --> 02:09:08.420 align:start position:0%
state by one billion dollars per year
 
02:09:11.209 --> 02:09:11.219 align:start position:0%
why come to the state and ask where that
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
assistance why would not the business
 
02:09:14.450 --> 02:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
Community itself step to the plate I
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
mean it's in their best interest
 
02:09:19.609 --> 02:09:19.619 align:start position:0%
to support this cause why not reach out
 
02:09:21.050 --> 02:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
to the business community and having
 
02:09:21.060 --> 02:09:22.010 align:start position:0%
to the business community and having
them

02:09:22.010 --> 02:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:09:24.050 --> 02:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
solve some of the problems versus coming
 
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
02:09:28.970 --> 02:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
so I will um unfortunately oh no
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
fortunately my my co-sponsor is somebody
 
02:09:33.709 --> 02:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
from the business Community Senator
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
Fenton I think he would be someone who
 
02:09:37.490 --> 02:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
would be good to speak to that issue my
 
02:09:39.109 --> 02:09:39.119 align:start position:0%
question in response to your question is
 
02:09:41.390 --> 02:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
by business Community do you mean the
 
02:09:43.250 --> 02:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
child care businesses themselves or do
 
02:09:45.290 --> 02:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
you mean uh
 
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
what could you clarify the question for
 
02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:48.250 align:start position:0%
what could you clarify the question for
me

02:09:48.250 --> 02:09:48.260 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:09:51.169 --> 02:09:51.179 align:start position:0%
it's not the child care industry itself
 
02:09:53.629 --> 02:09:53.639 align:start position:0%
it's the ones that use the workforce the
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
child care industry would support
 
02:09:57.709 --> 02:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
um so if you're looking at greater
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
participation from the workforce I would
 
02:09:59.639 --> 02:10:00.649 align:start position:0%
participation from the workforce I would
assume

02:10:00.649 --> 02:10:00.659 align:start position:0%
assume
 
02:10:03.229 --> 02:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
the clarification here that what you're
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
asking for is to have more people in the
 
02:10:07.370 --> 02:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
workforce so the economy can become more
 
02:10:10.070 --> 02:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
robust not so much specifically with
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
child care but the economy overall
 
02:10:16.370 --> 02:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification uh
 
02:10:19.089 --> 02:10:19.099 align:start position:0%
well I certainly think that that
 
02:10:21.709 --> 02:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
businesses in our community should be
 
02:10:23.810 --> 02:10:23.820 align:start position:0%
willing to contribute more for exactly
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
the reason you point out I don't believe
 
02:10:27.470 --> 02:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
that that provides any consistency over
 
02:10:29.330 --> 02:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
the middle or long term right there
 
02:10:31.129 --> 02:10:31.139 align:start position:0%
there are businesses who may think we
 
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't have that many people working for
 
02:10:35.450 --> 02:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
us for example who need child care uh
 
02:10:37.370 --> 02:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
but also smaller businesses who may have
 
02:10:39.890 --> 02:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
may not have those needs who may think
 
02:10:41.570 --> 02:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea but may not feel
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
financially incentivized to help out in
 
02:10:46.850 --> 02:10:46.860 align:start position:0%
a case like this and then also as I said
 
02:10:48.649 --> 02:10:48.659 align:start position:0%
over time if a business decides to
 
02:10:50.570 --> 02:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
contribute now or contribute three years
 
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
from now that doesn't mean that they're
 
02:10:53.330 --> 02:10:53.340 align:start position:0%
going to be willing to contribute five
 
02:10:55.430 --> 02:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
or ten years from now so having it
 
02:10:59.510 --> 02:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
structured this way provides a guarantee
 
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
of consistency over time that the fund
 
02:11:04.370 --> 02:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
will exist whereas as I said I like your
 
02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
idea but I don't believe that it
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
provides that same stability
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative Weber did you have your
 
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
I was wondering your thoughts
 
02:11:19.089 --> 02:11:19.099 align:start position:0%
um on
 
02:11:23.089 --> 02:11:23.099 align:start position:0%
the uh trade-off of doing it this way
 
02:11:26.169 --> 02:11:26.179 align:start position:0%
versus perhaps something like
 
02:11:28.669 --> 02:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
restructuring our minimum wage here in
 
02:11:30.109 --> 02:11:30.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and did you give thought
 
02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:11:33.530 --> 02:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber thank you
 
02:11:36.410 --> 02:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
for the question I I think that both of
 
02:11:38.209 --> 02:11:38.219 align:start position:0%
those things can and should be done
 
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
right as a another representative
 
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
pointed out right this is not a Panacea
 
02:11:43.550 --> 02:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
this is not a silver bullet this is not
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
going to raise wages to the levels that
 
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
they need to be at in order to provide a
 
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
long-term solution to this problem so I
 
02:11:52.910 --> 02:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
think both of those things need to be
 
02:11:55.490 --> 02:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
done I don't think they uh need to be
 
02:11:57.770 --> 02:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
done they're not mutually exclusive it's
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
not that we do one or the other I
 
02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
believe they both need to be done thank
 
02:12:03.890 --> 02:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative Leon thank
 
02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative for presenting this bill
 
02:12:09.649 --> 02:12:09.659 align:start position:0%
um looking at your testimony you spoke
 
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
to how for a state government jobs we
 
02:12:14.330 --> 02:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
offer the Recruitment and Retention
 
02:12:16.189 --> 02:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
bonuses and you were speaking about
 
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:18.599 align:start position:0%
offering that same benefit here in
 
02:12:20.689 --> 02:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
private Child Care businesses you've
 
02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
also spoken to increasing that amount
 
02:12:25.129 --> 02:12:25.139 align:start position:0%
increasing the wages I'm just curious if
 
02:12:26.930 --> 02:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
this is moving towards more of a public
 
02:12:29.450 --> 02:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
partner public-private Partnership of
 
02:12:32.330 --> 02:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
looking at basically extending the the
 
02:12:34.370 --> 02:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
public schools down to Early Education
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
or looking at a fully public model I'm
 
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand where you're
 
02:12:39.890 --> 02:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
headed here thank you
 
02:12:42.109 --> 02:12:42.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and where I'm headed
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
is adequate compensation for the workers
 
02:12:46.669 --> 02:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
in this field ultimately and I do think
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
that that has to take the form of some
 
02:12:50.450 --> 02:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
kind of public-private partnership in
 
02:12:52.490 --> 02:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
fact when our committee I'm on
 
02:12:54.109 --> 02:12:54.119 align:start position:0%
environment agriculture but when we had
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh coffee with the governor a few weeks
 
02:12:58.609 --> 02:12:58.619 align:start position:0%
ago I was talking to governor sununu and
 
02:13:00.410 --> 02:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
that's exactly the phrasing that he used
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
when he was talking about how he
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
envisioned us going forward being able
 
02:13:08.750 --> 02:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
to help build this Workforce is we have
 
02:13:10.870 --> 02:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
to find a way to have a public private
 
02:13:14.450 --> 02:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
partnership the the
 
02:13:17.089 --> 02:13:17.099 align:start position:0%
idea of for example having our Public
 
02:13:19.250 --> 02:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
Schools extend down right so if we had
 
02:13:20.569 --> 02:13:20.579 align:start position:0%
something like a universal preschool
 
02:13:23.089 --> 02:13:23.099 align:start position:0%
that got folded in at age three into our
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
into our into our public school system
 
02:13:27.050 --> 02:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
the problem with that and I think our
 
02:13:28.669 --> 02:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
our providers here could speak to it
 
02:13:30.410 --> 02:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
more eloquently than I can is that's
 
02:13:32.510 --> 02:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
going to kill child care
 
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
for younger children that's the that's
 
02:13:37.550 --> 02:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
the most expensive Child Care uh and so
 
02:13:41.629 --> 02:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
if we were to fold three and up into our
 
02:13:43.490 --> 02:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
current system of public education it
 
02:13:45.229 --> 02:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
would absolutely my understanding could
 
02:13:47.930 --> 02:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
perhaps speak to that more uh it
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
destroys the private business model of
 
02:13:55.550 --> 02:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:56.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shapiro thank
 
02:14:01.310 --> 02:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking
 
02:14:04.370 --> 02:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
the question are you aware that uh
 
02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
a single parent with two children who is
 
02:14:09.709 --> 02:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
starting off working in daycare and
 
02:14:11.330 --> 02:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
making I think you said twenty eight
 
02:14:14.030 --> 02:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars would be eligible to
 
02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:15.900 align:start position:0%
receive Medicaid benefits for their
 
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
children and aren't we kind of passing
 
02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
on other costs to the state by paying
 
02:14:23.629 --> 02:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
our um
 
02:14:27.050 --> 02:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
our child care teachers so little
 
02:14:30.350 --> 02:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
uh I had not thought of that but as as
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
you pointed out yes absolutely and and I
 
02:14:34.669 --> 02:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
think your point is very well taken
 
02:14:37.490 --> 02:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
right that there are uh added costs to
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
this already for the State uh that I
 
02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
haven't addressed in the bill but that
 
02:14:43.850 --> 02:14:43.860 align:start position:0%
you addressed very well there thank you
 
02:14:47.689 --> 02:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:49.370 --> 02:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
okay I see none thank you very much
 
02:14:55.069 --> 02:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:57.530 --> 02:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak this morning is
 
02:15:05.629 --> 02:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:07.609 --> 02:15:07.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and ladies and
 
02:15:09.410 --> 02:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
gentlemen the committee for the record I
 
02:15:11.330 --> 02:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
am Senator Donovan Fenton I represent
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
district 10 which is a lot of town so
 
02:15:16.250 --> 02:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
it's mostly Cheshire county and uh
 
02:15:18.649 --> 02:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
Peterborough I have no formal written
 
02:15:20.030 --> 02:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm actually going to hang up
 
02:15:21.950 --> 02:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
my hat as a legislator today and just
 
02:15:25.069 --> 02:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
talk about my experiences I have a
 
02:15:28.010 --> 02:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
four-year-old and a two-year-old and my
 
02:15:30.050 --> 02:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
two-year-old was on a 16-month wait list
 
02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
for child care I'm also a business owner
 
02:15:35.089 --> 02:15:35.099 align:start position:0%
and when I go out to hire prospective
 
02:15:37.550 --> 02:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
employees I can't hire employees because
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
they can't find Child Care here in New
 
02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm in Keene so I sit on
 
02:15:43.189 --> 02:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
that border right between Vermont and
 
02:15:45.050 --> 02:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and I try to attract them
 
02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
and I just can't you know the barriers
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
for child care for housing whole
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
different story are are real
 
02:15:54.530 --> 02:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
um and I'm dealing with that daily and
 
02:15:56.209 --> 02:15:56.219 align:start position:0%
that that's truly really all I have to
 
02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
say if you guys have any questions for
 
02:15:58.910 --> 02:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
me uh representative said I was a
 
02:16:00.530 --> 02:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
business leader but I'm not sure about
 
02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
that but I'm happy to take any questions
 
02:16:04.609 --> 02:16:04.619 align:start position:0%
about a public-private partnership thank
 
02:16:06.530 --> 02:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
you Senator any questions for the
 
02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:07.729 align:start position:0%
you Senator any questions for the
senator

02:16:07.729 --> 02:16:07.739 align:start position:0%
senator
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
I thought you're gonna let me off easy
 
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:16:14.330 --> 02:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead thank you chairman
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
I've seen articles and things in the
 
02:16:18.109 --> 02:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
past where I don't know if it's
 
02:16:20.689 --> 02:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
necessarily New Hampshire specific but
 
02:16:22.129 --> 02:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
um let's say you want to have a little
 
02:16:24.350 --> 02:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
daycare in your home that there are
 
02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:27.300 align:start position:0%
regulations that require you have like
 
02:16:29.569 --> 02:16:29.579 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollar stoves and and and
 
02:16:31.790 --> 02:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
and you know your air quality has to be
 
02:16:33.950 --> 02:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
specifically perfect and there has to be
 
02:16:37.250 --> 02:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
you know rubber on everything to prevent
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
somebody getting injured and there's
 
02:16:40.969 --> 02:16:40.979 align:start position:0%
there's all these regulations and stuff
 
02:16:42.410 --> 02:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
um can you address that is there is
 
02:16:46.750 --> 02:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
there a sort of um uh cost that is
 
02:16:50.209 --> 02:16:50.219 align:start position:0%
burdening people from getting into Child
 
02:16:52.310 --> 02:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
Care work because it seems to me like
 
02:16:54.049 --> 02:16:54.059 align:start position:0%
you want to get into Child Care work and
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
you're like oh sorry I have to retrofit
 
02:16:57.349 --> 02:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
my house for fifteen thousand dollars
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
just before I'm allowed to even like do
 
02:17:01.490 --> 02:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
that so that could be a serious barrier
 
02:17:04.490 --> 02:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
right there you know um maybe we can
 
02:17:05.870 --> 02:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
move in that direction instead what are
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
your thoughts about that thank you thank
 
02:17:09.169 --> 02:17:09.179 align:start position:0%
you representative for the question I
 
02:17:11.570 --> 02:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
think um let's twofold no I think what
 
02:17:13.490 --> 02:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
you're addressing is starting your own
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
daycare business versus we're trying to
 
02:17:18.770 --> 02:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
attract Educators to the field uh
 
02:17:19.849 --> 02:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
because there's just there's no
 
02:17:21.230 --> 02:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
accessible and there's no affordable
 
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
child care I think that is an option I
 
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
think another option would be uh
 
02:17:27.650 --> 02:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
loosening barriers to have uh day care
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
centers in businesses as well the
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
problem is we have to do something
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
because it is a problem and you know a
 
02:17:35.810 --> 02:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
strong economy is based on a strong
 
02:17:38.270 --> 02:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
Child Care Workforce and we do not have
 
02:17:40.310 --> 02:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
that and it's gonna it's really gonna
 
02:17:41.690 --> 02:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
hurt us in the future but I do think
 
02:17:42.889 --> 02:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
that's a good point you brought up
 
02:17:42.899 --> 02:17:44.330 align:start position:0%
that's a good point you brought up
representative

02:17:44.330 --> 02:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:17:46.669 --> 02:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
02:17:48.290 --> 02:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you senator for
 
02:17:50.089 --> 02:17:50.099 align:start position:0%
coming over here congratulations it was
 
02:17:51.049 --> 02:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
great to serve with you on those
 
02:17:54.049 --> 02:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
committees last year my question is
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
about how we're having this committee
 
02:17:57.770 --> 02:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
that's looking at child care and looking
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
at the overall question and as a
 
02:18:01.610 --> 02:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
business owner I just want to ask you
 
02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
how much these subsidies where the
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal note came in I think it was three
 
02:18:07.129 --> 02:18:07.139 align:start position:0%
or four million dollars a year how these
 
02:18:10.370 --> 02:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
subsidies to just go a short distance to
 
02:18:12.650 --> 02:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
slightly alleviate the problem are going
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
to make a meaningful impact as opposed
 
02:18:16.129 --> 02:18:16.139 align:start position:0%
to looking at those larger structural
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
issues about being able to bring in a
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
child care center into your office maybe
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
some of the downtime for your employees
 
02:18:23.750 --> 02:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
providing some of that coverage for
 
02:18:25.730 --> 02:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
their co-workers time how much do we
 
02:18:27.709 --> 02:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
need to reimagine this and is this
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
subsidy just a Band-Aid
 
02:18:30.410 --> 02:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative I don't believe I've seen
 
02:18:34.009 --> 02:18:34.019 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note yet for this bill so I'm
 
02:18:35.629 --> 02:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
not sure if that's what you're referring
 
02:18:37.969 --> 02:18:37.979 align:start position:0%
to I'm not sure what it is
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
um that being said uh you know a
 
02:18:41.690 --> 02:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid is better than a wound right
 
02:18:43.370 --> 02:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
now in my opinion because we have
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
nothing uh you know like I said my child
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
was waiting for 11 months up to and it's
 
02:18:49.429 --> 02:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh you know I'm not the only person
 
02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
feeling this I'm sure you will have uh
 
02:18:53.810 --> 02:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
kids or grandkids that are in the same
 
02:18:56.030 --> 02:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
boat I'm lucky I live near my uh my mom
 
02:18:58.129 --> 02:18:58.139 align:start position:0%
and we dump our kids on her all the time
 
02:19:00.049 --> 02:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
because we can't find a babysitter and
 
02:19:01.730 --> 02:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh the child care center
 
02:19:03.530 --> 02:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
closes at four whereas I work till five
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
or I'm here a little late depending on
 
02:19:07.669 --> 02:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
how late committee goes so I think uh
 
02:19:10.910 --> 02:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
any options right now are on the table
 
02:19:15.469 --> 02:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:24.049 --> 02:19:24.059 align:start position:0%
they also signed up to testify is Donna
 
02:19:38.810 --> 02:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:40.730 --> 02:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
I'm new with this
 
02:19:43.190 --> 02:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
my name is Donna hasher I own the
 
02:19:45.290 --> 02:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
learning path Child Care Center
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you for meeting with us today
 
02:19:49.730 --> 02:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
the business of child care is an
 
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
important one
 
02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
I say it all the time we are a
 
02:19:56.090 --> 02:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
legitimate business
 
02:19:58.730 --> 02:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
our monthly costs
 
02:20:01.010 --> 02:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
are over you know they're millions of
 
02:20:02.570 --> 02:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
02:20:05.210 --> 02:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
dollars spent at local businesses we pay
 
02:20:07.969 --> 02:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
federal state and local taxes and we
 
02:20:11.330 --> 02:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
employ thousands of local residents
 
02:20:13.849 --> 02:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
we do not get refunds or discounts for
 
02:20:16.849 --> 02:20:16.859 align:start position:0%
any of these expenses but our annual
 
02:20:19.550 --> 02:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
income compared to our annual expenses
 
02:20:21.469 --> 02:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
is skewed
 
02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
I established the learning path in 1999
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
up until recently I owned two large
 
02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
centers employing 45 teachers
 
02:20:33.530 --> 02:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
I sold my Dairy Center in December but I
 
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
still own my Salem Center I have 23
 
02:20:38.690 --> 02:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
teachers employed
 
02:20:41.330 --> 02:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
these 23 New Hampshire residents who I
 
02:20:44.090 --> 02:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
am responsible to keep employed I need
 
02:20:46.490 --> 02:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
to offer benefits and increase salaries
 
02:20:49.969 --> 02:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:52.250 --> 02:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
for the learning path to run effectively
 
02:20:55.010 --> 02:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
and to reduce staff over time and
 
02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
burnout I've been advertising for two
 
02:20:59.870 --> 02:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
new teachers
 
02:21:02.809 --> 02:21:02.819 align:start position:0%
because we are not in industry
 
02:21:04.849 --> 02:21:04.859 align:start position:0%
that can function without a full staff
 
02:21:07.849 --> 02:21:07.859 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
centers of force to close classrooms
 
02:21:13.370 --> 02:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
because of our low staff
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
and in turn this leaves families
 
02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
without Dependable Child Care like you
 
02:21:21.469 --> 02:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
just heard the gentleman here
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
help is needed any help will do a
 
02:21:27.530 --> 02:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid is better than a wound
 
02:21:29.630 --> 02:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
and we need it soon
 
02:21:32.030 --> 02:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
there is an unprecedented Staffing
 
02:21:34.730 --> 02:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
crisis within the child care industry
 
02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
and I've never seen this before
 
02:21:40.190 --> 02:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
please let's work together we could use
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
your support
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%

thank you for your attention
 
02:21:54.410 --> 02:21:54.420 align:start position:0%

02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
sounds like
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
um You probably balance a budget and
 
02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:09.180 align:start position:0%
checkbook and these sorts of things
 
02:22:10.849 --> 02:22:10.859 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you would be able to
 
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
answer this or not but let's say you did
 
02:22:14.030 --> 02:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
get like a three thousand dollar check
 
02:22:16.429 --> 02:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
from the state of New Hampshire
 
02:22:18.050 --> 02:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
um do you think you would likely have to
 
02:22:20.090 --> 02:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
pay federal income taxes on that would
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
you end up spending like 30 percent of
 
02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
that just to give to the IRS and and if
 
02:22:24.420 --> 02:22:25.910 align:start position:0%
that just to give to the IRS and and if
so

02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:22:27.469 --> 02:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
um do you think it might not be better
 
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
for you to receive more of a like a tax
 
02:22:32.330 --> 02:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
rebate in the in the like so for example
 
02:22:33.830 --> 02:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
let's say you're paying I'm just making
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
up numbers here ten thousand dollars a
 
02:22:37.309 --> 02:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
year in property taxes what if you had
 
02:22:38.929 --> 02:22:38.939 align:start position:0%
to pay three thousand dollars Less in
 
02:22:41.330 --> 02:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
property taxes that would be right that
 
02:22:42.770 --> 02:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
that's still three thousand more dollars
 
02:22:44.090 --> 02:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
you have in your pocket plus you're not
 
02:22:46.010 --> 02:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
having to give a third of that to the
 
02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
federal government right so maybe we
 
02:22:50.690 --> 02:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
could how do you feel about instead of
 
02:22:53.450 --> 02:22:53.460 align:start position:0%
the money going from taxpayers to the
 
02:22:54.770 --> 02:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and then to your
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
pocket and then to the IRS what about
 
02:22:58.309 --> 02:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
just less money you have to pay the
 
02:22:59.330 --> 02:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
state New Hampshire what do you think
 
02:23:00.830 --> 02:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you well that's definitely another
 
02:23:02.330 --> 02:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
good option
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
um the responsibility of the the child
 
02:23:05.690 --> 02:23:05.700 align:start position:0%
care centers
 
02:23:08.210 --> 02:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
get that tax credit
 
02:23:10.670 --> 02:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
go to staff they would have to be
 
02:23:13.250 --> 02:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
responsible owner to make sure that that
 
02:23:15.650 --> 02:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
credit goes directly to the staff
 
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:23.210 --> 02:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions yeah
 
02:23:25.490 --> 02:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
representative McLean thank you Mr chair
 
02:23:29.090 --> 02:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
so of the 23 workers
 
02:23:31.250 --> 02:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
um that you have in Salem and you're
 
02:23:33.650 --> 02:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
right on the border with Massachusetts
 
02:23:33.660 --> 02:23:34.450 align:start position:0%
right on the border with Massachusetts
um

02:23:34.450 --> 02:23:34.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:37.969 --> 02:23:37.979 align:start position:0%
what what are what what is your
 
02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
retention like how long have you had
 
02:23:43.370 --> 02:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
these 23 uh people and
 
02:23:46.370 --> 02:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
what would the impact of this bill have
 
02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
on the retention of those 23 folks
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
um I opened the Salem School in 2011. my
 
02:23:57.469 --> 02:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
director has been with me ever since
 
02:23:59.570 --> 02:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
um and then I have teachers that joined
 
02:24:02.690 --> 02:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
us right away and are still employed and
 
02:24:05.570 --> 02:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
I have teachers who have left uh to go
 
02:24:08.870 --> 02:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
to different fields because of the the
 
02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:10.790 align:start position:0%
to different fields because of the the
expense

02:24:10.790 --> 02:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
expense
 
02:24:12.770 --> 02:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
uh the low salary
 
02:24:15.290 --> 02:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
so compensation is important to retain
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
but we can only do so much because what
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
happens it has to come out of the
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
tuition rate so tuition goes up and the
 
02:24:23.330 --> 02:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
and it's the parents who are now
 
02:24:25.969 --> 02:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
struggling because now again it's
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
02:24:34.370 --> 02:24:34.380 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
02:24:36.170 --> 02:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
um thank you I'm just looking at sorry
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:24:39.650 --> 02:24:39.660 align:start position:0%
um the question is we're looking at a
 
02:24:41.809 --> 02:24:41.819 align:start position:0%
complete a huge lack of supply and then
 
02:24:44.570 --> 02:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
we're also looking at the low rates I'm
 
02:24:46.130 --> 02:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
trying to understand as a business owner
 
02:24:47.929 --> 02:24:47.939 align:start position:0%
how you're balancing increasing the
 
02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
rates so that you can provide those that
 
02:24:52.490 --> 02:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
available coverage for people who need
 
02:24:54.889 --> 02:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
it while being able to to pay your
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
employees more but then also making sure
 
02:24:58.969 --> 02:24:58.979 align:start position:0%
that it's not pricing out other people
 
02:25:00.050 --> 02:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
in the market I'm just trying to
 
02:25:01.490 --> 02:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
understand how you get to that because
 
02:25:03.349 --> 02:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
I'm an economist I look at supply and
 
02:25:05.389 --> 02:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
demand you balance the price with the
 
02:25:07.010 --> 02:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
need and I'm just trying to make this
 
02:25:09.770 --> 02:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
compute yes and again it's raising
 
02:25:12.110 --> 02:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
tuition every time you know staff gets
 
02:25:14.690 --> 02:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
increases so for September rate
 
02:25:18.410 --> 02:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
increases are are expected and um and
 
02:25:20.510 --> 02:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a low percent we give a dollar
 
02:25:22.429 --> 02:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
an hour a raise every year to my staff
 
02:25:24.349 --> 02:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
so if my staff has been with me for a
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
long time they're making more than they
 
02:25:30.170 --> 02:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
are in other than other centers but it's
 
02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:31.490 align:start position:0%
are in other than other centers but it's
expensive

02:25:31.490 --> 02:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
02:25:34.490 --> 02:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
um to do that we are cutting back we're
 
02:25:36.530 --> 02:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
raising tuition and maybe cutting back
 
02:25:39.650 --> 02:25:39.660 align:start position:0%
on other things to accommodate that
 
02:25:40.969 --> 02:25:40.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:42.889 --> 02:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:49.790 --> 02:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question and
 
02:25:53.090 --> 02:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for giving me the
 
02:25:56.809 --> 02:25:56.819 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ask uh the
 
02:26:00.410 --> 02:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
when I when I hear all the numbers and
 
02:26:00.420 --> 02:26:01.429 align:start position:0%
when I when I hear all the numbers and
um

02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
what keeps coming into my mind is you
 
02:26:08.570 --> 02:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
know what in your mind is driving
 
02:26:11.929 --> 02:26:11.939 align:start position:0%
the uh the salary rate the salary rates
 
02:26:14.150 --> 02:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
up and what's
 
02:26:16.130 --> 02:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
02:26:18.290 --> 02:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
which then
 
02:26:18.300 --> 02:26:18.950 align:start position:0%
which then
um

02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:22.010 --> 02:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
increases the amount that you have to
 
02:26:25.090 --> 02:26:25.100 align:start position:0%
charge parents what factor do you
 
02:26:27.410 --> 02:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
attribute that to
 
02:26:29.870 --> 02:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
well we always look at of course the
 
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
minimum wage we are a mass a
 
02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Border Town
 
02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
um my staff could go over the border and
 
02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:39.590 align:start position:0%
um my staff could go over the border and
make

02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
substantially more than that
 
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
so that's always a struggle
 
02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:47.809 align:start position:0%
so that's always a struggle
and

02:26:47.809 --> 02:26:47.819 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:26:51.050 --> 02:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
raising tuition is our only only
 
02:26:56.929 --> 02:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:01.070 --> 02:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:02.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:27:02.510 --> 02:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
thank you again chairman McDonald
 
02:27:04.319 --> 02:27:05.210 align:start position:0%

again I don't know if this is how it is
 
02:27:08.210 --> 02:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but it's my
 
02:27:10.670 --> 02:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that in many states in
 
02:27:13.490 --> 02:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
order to become any sort of child care
 
02:27:16.130 --> 02:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
provider or nanny or such you know you
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
have to get vaccinated with covid-19 do
 
02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
we have any requirement in New Hampshire
 
02:27:23.090 --> 02:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
to do that no we don't thank you
 
02:27:27.170 --> 02:27:27.180 align:start position:0%

thank you for having me
 
02:27:51.110 --> 02:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
um this is my first time testifying so

for being here my name is Elizabeth or
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
Libby brunette that's how I go I'm the
 
02:27:59.929 --> 02:27:59.939 align:start position:0%
director of the Applewood Learning
 
02:28:01.730 --> 02:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
Center in Londonderry and I wanted to
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
lend my support to this bill as a
 
02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
veteran director in the field of early
 
02:28:07.550 --> 02:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
childhood education I can tell you that
 
02:28:10.190 --> 02:28:10.200 align:start position:0%
hiring qualified teachers has always
 
02:28:12.170 --> 02:28:12.180 align:start position:0%
been a struggle but since the pandemic
 
02:28:14.270 --> 02:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
it's nearly impossible
 
02:28:17.469 --> 02:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
I have had two open positions
 
02:28:20.389 --> 02:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
in full-time open positions with
 
02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
benefits for over two years now and I
 
02:28:24.889 --> 02:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
cannot fill them which results in me
 
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
shutting down a classroom of infants and
 
02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
toddlers which could accommodate eight
 
02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:29.750 align:start position:0%
toddlers which could accommodate eight
children

02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:28:31.969 --> 02:28:31.979 align:start position:0%
now eight children doesn't seem like a
 
02:28:34.790 --> 02:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
lot but when you have a waiting list of
 
02:28:38.990 --> 02:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 80 children it's 10 so
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a significant number
 
02:28:43.070 --> 02:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
that families that are not being served
 
02:28:46.490 --> 02:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
because we cannot staff our programs
 
02:28:46.500 --> 02:28:48.050 align:start position:0%
because we cannot staff our programs
um

02:28:48.050 --> 02:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:51.290 --> 02:28:51.300 align:start position:0%
most of the time when a family misses
 
02:28:53.210 --> 02:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to enroll when we have a
 
02:28:55.370 --> 02:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
infant opening they're looking at a two
 
02:28:57.590 --> 02:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
to three year weight on our waiting list
 
02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's only until their child is preschool
 
02:29:01.490 --> 02:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
age that they are then able to access
 
02:29:04.429 --> 02:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
high quality child care
 
02:29:06.590 --> 02:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
this potentially results in a parent
 
02:29:10.210 --> 02:29:10.220 align:start position:0%
being out of work for about three years
 
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
our staff are in desperate need of
 
02:29:14.889 --> 02:29:14.899 align:start position:0%
support we have teachers in our program
 
02:29:17.210 --> 02:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
who are qualified to work in the public
 
02:29:18.889 --> 02:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
school but because of their own
 
02:29:22.550 --> 02:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
dedication to the field they have stayed
 
02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:23.210 align:start position:0%
dedication to the field they have stayed
um

02:29:23.210 --> 02:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:25.250 --> 02:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
they're oftentimes only able to do this
 
02:29:27.650 --> 02:29:27.660 align:start position:0%
because they have a spouse who makes an
 
02:29:29.870 --> 02:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
adequate income they're living at home
 
02:29:32.090 --> 02:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
with their parents as an adult or
 
02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
they're taking on a second job which
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
oftentimes that second job
 
02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
supplementing their meager income with
 
02:29:43.010 --> 02:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
us is sometimes more than what their
 
02:29:45.730 --> 02:29:45.740 align:start position:0%
hourly wages with us
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
these teachers are laying the foundation
 
02:29:51.290 --> 02:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
for children's lives they're they're
 
02:29:53.809 --> 02:29:53.819 align:start position:0%
learning their their way of being in the
 
02:29:53.819 --> 02:29:55.010 align:start position:0%
learning their their way of being in the
world

02:29:55.010 --> 02:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
world
 
02:29:57.170 --> 02:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
um the groundwork we are developing is
 
02:30:01.730 --> 02:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:04.750 --> 02:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
um sorry contributing members of society
 
02:30:07.190 --> 02:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
the national Forum on Early Childhood
 
02:30:10.010 --> 02:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
policy and programs has found that high
 
02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
quality Child Care is a four to nine
 
02:30:15.050 --> 02:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
dollar return for every one dollar
 
02:30:19.610 --> 02:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
invested so money spent in child care is
 
02:30:22.910 --> 02:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
just smart spending thank you
 
02:30:26.090 --> 02:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you are you taking questions
 
02:30:29.630 --> 02:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
any questions for this lady
 
02:30:32.590 --> 02:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative palazzov
 
02:30:35.809 --> 02:30:35.819 align:start position:0%
so talking about business decisions if
 
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
you have 80 people pretending for eight
 
02:30:42.170 --> 02:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
sports like what stops you from
 
02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
releasing a rates like is there concerns
 
02:30:48.190 --> 02:30:48.200 align:start position:0%
that demand will develop
 
02:30:52.190 --> 02:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
significantly in coming years or like
 
02:30:54.770 --> 02:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
why why you're not just releasing the
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
rates to raise this a little thank you
 
02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
why are we not raising the tuition rates
 
02:31:04.010 --> 02:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
um so our tuition rates are probably the
 
02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
I would say the second highest in our
 
02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:07.190 align:start position:0%
I would say the second highest in our
town

02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:31:09.230 --> 02:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
um are for a full-time infant in our
 
02:31:12.050 --> 02:31:12.060 align:start position:0%
care it's over 400 a week
 
02:31:14.570 --> 02:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
um so families can't afford that they're
 
02:31:16.190 --> 02:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
paying more for child care than they are
 
02:31:19.070 --> 02:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
so we can't justify
 
02:31:24.650 --> 02:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
I mean we can justify it's the actual
 
02:31:27.170 --> 02:31:27.180 align:start position:0%
cost of quality but
 
02:31:29.929 --> 02:31:29.939 align:start position:0%
will then end up with people going to
 
02:31:32.929 --> 02:31:32.939 align:start position:0%
lesser quality programs
 
02:31:37.490 --> 02:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:38.990 --> 02:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
okay I see none thank you very much
 
02:31:43.730 --> 02:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:45.710 --> 02:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify this morning
 
02:31:48.530 --> 02:31:48.540 align:start position:0%
is Jackie Cowell from The Early Learning
 
02:31:53.630 --> 02:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:55.550 --> 02:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
good morning hi
 
02:31:56.990 --> 02:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director I'm Jackie
 
02:31:58.969 --> 02:31:58.979 align:start position:0%
Cowell I'm the executive director of
 
02:32:00.889 --> 02:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
early learning New Hampshire we are a
 
02:32:03.050 --> 02:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
Statewide non-profit with membership
 
02:32:06.290 --> 02:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
services for child care programs we do
 
02:32:07.969 --> 02:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
cost buying and sharing and trying to
 
02:32:10.730 --> 02:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
help them put money back into their into
 
02:32:14.389 --> 02:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
their budgets we also do some of this
 
02:32:16.790 --> 02:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
advocacy and on behalf of both of the
 
02:32:18.410 --> 02:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
employers the child care programs the
 
02:32:21.110 --> 02:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
teachers and the families they serve so
 
02:32:24.650 --> 02:32:24.660 align:start position:0%
our mission if I didn't say it is that
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
we are committed to ensuring that every
 
02:32:28.610 --> 02:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire child has the opportunity
 
02:32:30.410 --> 02:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
to reach their full potential so I'll be
 
02:32:32.030 --> 02:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
really brief because these are the other
 
02:32:33.349 --> 02:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
these are the people you really need to
 
02:32:35.270 --> 02:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
hear from most but I used to run for
 
02:32:37.010 --> 02:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
about 13 years of child care in New
 
02:32:38.330 --> 02:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I
 
02:32:40.370 --> 02:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
um and so what I'd like to say first you
 
02:32:42.230 --> 02:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
know in addition you you heard well
 
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
about child care you know both supports
 
02:32:46.250 --> 02:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
the workforce of today but really in
 
02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
partnership with parents it helps
 
02:32:49.969 --> 02:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
prepare the workforce of Tomorrow Too
 
02:32:52.370 --> 02:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
something you may not realize the math
 
02:32:55.010 --> 02:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
works on this is that a child who's
 
02:32:57.349 --> 02:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
mommered at or both work nine to five
 
02:32:59.929 --> 02:32:59.939 align:start position:0%
Monday through Friday can spend more
 
02:33:02.809 --> 02:33:02.819 align:start position:0%
hours in child care than they will in
 
02:33:04.190 --> 02:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
their Public School career all the way
 
02:33:06.770 --> 02:33:06.780 align:start position:0%
through grade 12. the math works on that
 
02:33:08.809 --> 02:33:08.819 align:start position:0%
and so and of course you all you
 
02:33:09.950 --> 02:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
probably all know about the development
 
02:33:11.750 --> 02:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the young child and now the brain
 
02:33:13.370 --> 02:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
neural connections that are being made
 
02:33:15.530 --> 02:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
this time of their life is so important
 
02:33:19.130 --> 02:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
to have great experiences so that's
 
02:33:20.690 --> 02:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
another thing that child care does in
 
02:33:22.190 --> 02:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
addition to supporting the workforce
 
02:33:24.010 --> 02:33:24.020 align:start position:0%
that people have mentioned very well
 
02:33:26.830 --> 02:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
Senator excuse me representative Nagel
 
02:33:29.090 --> 02:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
you mentioned you had a question about
 
02:33:32.590 --> 02:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
turnover and what I can tell you is
 
02:33:34.750 --> 02:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
not many
 
02:33:36.650 --> 02:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
surveys have been done during the
 
02:33:38.210 --> 02:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's all over the map and
 
02:33:39.950 --> 02:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
people say it's not indicative but
 
02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic and we know it's
 
02:33:43.490 --> 02:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
worse now you've heard that it really is
 
02:33:46.790 --> 02:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
worse now about 30 percent of the
 
02:33:48.889 --> 02:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
workforce turned over
 
02:33:50.389 --> 02:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:33:53.210 --> 02:33:53.220 align:start position:0%
so by three years you almost have a
 
02:33:54.889 --> 02:33:54.899 align:start position:0%
whole new Workforce there yes there are
 
02:33:57.290 --> 02:33:57.300 align:start position:0%
people who who stay and it's wonderful
 
02:33:58.730 --> 02:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to do a little
 
02:34:00.050 --> 02:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
bit with this bill
 
02:34:02.090 --> 02:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
from my work with working with young
 
02:34:03.770 --> 02:34:03.780 align:start position:0%
children in a Child Care Program I can
 
02:34:05.929 --> 02:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
tell you we use the word turnover
 
02:34:07.370 --> 02:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
but you ever go into one of those
 
02:34:09.469 --> 02:34:09.479 align:start position:0%
classrooms and you hear the teacher
 
02:34:11.389 --> 02:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
their three-year-old in front of the
 
02:34:12.590 --> 02:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
three-year-olds telling them she's
 
02:34:14.570 --> 02:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
leaving you don't call it turnover
 
02:34:17.389 --> 02:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
pardon me you call it loss and we really
 
02:34:19.010 --> 02:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
don't want this to keep happening in the
 
02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
lives of young children and so what
 
02:34:22.610 --> 02:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
we're really trying to do with this bill
 
02:34:24.950 --> 02:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
is whatever we can do
 
02:34:26.750 --> 02:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
um in addition to Band-Aid that's been
 
02:34:28.849 --> 02:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
talked about I would call it a bridge
 
02:34:30.889 --> 02:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
as the health and human services and
 
02:34:32.510 --> 02:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs committee I would love
 
02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
for you to to on a policy level say we
 
02:34:37.730 --> 02:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
support the idea of supporting the
 
02:34:39.469 --> 02:34:39.479 align:start position:0%
workforce I tell you it's going to go a
 
02:34:41.510 --> 02:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
long way to the field to hear that
 
02:34:44.090 --> 02:34:44.100 align:start position:0%
you've done that let Finance figure out
 
02:34:46.190 --> 02:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
that financing you know figuring out you
 
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
know where it's coming from whether it's
 
02:34:49.670 --> 02:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
here or from there and
 
02:34:51.349 --> 02:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
um and but I would love it if the Health
 
02:34:53.030 --> 02:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
and Human Services is an elderly Affairs
 
02:34:55.070 --> 02:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
committee would pass it along to finance
 
02:34:57.290 --> 02:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
say why it's so important it will
 
02:34:59.170 --> 02:34:59.180 align:start position:0%
honestly go a long way to the field
 
02:35:01.670 --> 02:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
knowing you understand the work they're
 
02:35:03.889 --> 02:35:03.899 align:start position:0%
doing and the teachers and that's all I
 
02:35:05.510 --> 02:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
have to say thank you very much
 
02:35:09.889 --> 02:35:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:14.030 --> 02:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
I see oh yes representative palazzov
 
02:35:17.389 --> 02:35:17.399 align:start position:0%
um uh do you know what the proportion of
 
02:35:22.010 --> 02:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
tuition generally goes towards stuff the
 
02:35:23.809 --> 02:35:23.819 align:start position:0%
latest as opposed to other business
 
02:35:25.790 --> 02:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
expenses oh thank you I like that
 
02:35:29.330 --> 02:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
question in fact about 80 percent 80 to
 
02:35:31.910 --> 02:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
95 percent of of the tuition that comes
 
02:35:33.950 --> 02:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
in whether it's sometimes the state pays
 
02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
a portion for families whose incomes you
 
02:35:38.570 --> 02:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
know but it no more money it's still 100
 
02:35:41.090 --> 02:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
let's say it's 100 400 a week State
 
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
might pay this much the parent pays this
 
02:35:44.809 --> 02:35:44.819 align:start position:0%
much if they qualify for this for the
 
02:35:47.150 --> 02:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
state subsidy but the point that's that
 
02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:48.710 align:start position:0%
state subsidy but the point that's that
tuition

02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
02:35:50.809 --> 02:35:50.819 align:start position:0%
um most whether non-profits and
 
02:35:53.330 --> 02:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
privately owned almost all the money
 
02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
goes towards Personnel it's a personal
 
02:35:58.790 --> 02:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
heavy if you're doing it right right so
 
02:36:01.130 --> 02:36:01.140 align:start position:0%
ninety percent of your 80 to 90 percent
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
of your expenses are people are the
 
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
people doing the work and 80 to 90
 
02:36:07.849 --> 02:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
percent of your income is the tuition
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
that's where that this that's where
 
02:36:11.450 --> 02:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
that's where people have talked about
 
02:36:13.790 --> 02:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
why it's so hard the parents don't have
 
02:36:16.130 --> 02:36:16.140 align:start position:0%
it you can charge it but you'll end up
 
02:36:18.170 --> 02:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
with balanced dues and it doesn't help
 
02:36:19.730 --> 02:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
the child and it doesn't help the family
 
02:36:21.469 --> 02:36:21.479 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't help the program so we're
 
02:36:24.349 --> 02:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
looking to see if there's any other
 
02:36:27.410 --> 02:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
places besides the parents to try to do
 
02:36:30.349 --> 02:36:30.359 align:start position:0%
something for the workforces
 
02:36:33.410 --> 02:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Nagel
 
02:36:35.270 --> 02:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:36:36.889 --> 02:36:36.899 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:36:38.870 --> 02:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
I'm really struggling with this bill for
 
02:36:40.309 --> 02:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of reasons
 
02:36:42.050 --> 02:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
um when I did the math it's about eight
 
02:36:44.330 --> 02:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
million dollars am I correct over three
 
02:36:44.340 --> 02:36:45.410 align:start position:0%
million dollars am I correct over three
years

02:36:45.410 --> 02:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:36:48.230 --> 02:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
on the last page there's it's over the
 
02:36:49.429 --> 02:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
three years it looks like the fiscal
 
02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
note that came out yesterday was three
 
02:36:52.910 --> 02:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
million in the first biennium 4 million
 
02:36:55.309 --> 02:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
in the next and recurring I see and the
 
02:36:56.990 --> 02:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
re the reason why I bring that up is
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
what you do is really important and I
 
02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
really appreciate everything we're
 
02:37:02.210 --> 02:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
trying to do but I want to make sure
 
02:37:04.190 --> 02:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
that this is an effective Band-Aid got
 
02:37:06.590 --> 02:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
it you're competing with virtually every
 
02:37:08.210 --> 02:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
industry in the labor market and
 
02:37:10.190 --> 02:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
virtually everybody's doing this and
 
02:37:12.230 --> 02:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
everybody's ending up in pretty much the
 
02:37:14.510 --> 02:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
same place they started with so why
 
02:37:17.030 --> 02:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
would this be different to improve your
 
02:37:19.550 --> 02:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
labor Mark your employability versus
 
02:37:21.950 --> 02:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
others that you're competing against and
 
02:37:24.790 --> 02:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
again you know the field obviously more
 
02:37:27.830 --> 02:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
would likely help more
 
02:37:30.410 --> 02:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
but and there are some bills you'll be
 
02:37:31.790 --> 02:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
seeing them hopefully from the Senate
 
02:37:33.590 --> 02:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
that actually do invest a little bit
 
02:37:36.170 --> 02:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
more and more and annually however
 
02:37:38.270 --> 02:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
you know if there's
 
02:37:40.730 --> 02:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
honestly something really needs to be
 
02:37:43.010 --> 02:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
said and and I do think it will have an
 
02:37:44.750 --> 02:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
effect would more money have more effect
 
02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:45.770 align:start position:0%
effect would more money have more effect
yes

02:37:45.770 --> 02:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:37:47.809 --> 02:37:47.819 align:start position:0%
but that's where I think Finance can get
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
into the details of it
 
02:37:52.969 --> 02:37:52.979 align:start position:0%
um and um and you know I really thank
 
02:37:54.710 --> 02:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative germana and Senator
 
02:37:57.770 --> 02:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
Donovan for doing this effort to try to
 
02:38:00.410 --> 02:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
start and and do some help
 
02:38:04.190 --> 02:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
um I I really I I really want to say you
 
02:38:06.110 --> 02:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
know it's going to go a long way
 
02:38:08.750 --> 02:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
the messaging the saying it's important
 
02:38:10.910 --> 02:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
that we're going to invest will make a
 
02:38:12.110 --> 02:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
difference well I think and I think it's
 
02:38:13.849 --> 02:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
a bridge it's a bridge to other
 
02:38:15.349 --> 02:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
Solutions you know there's the select
 
02:38:18.469 --> 02:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
committee on child care but they may not
 
02:38:20.330 --> 02:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
have some you know solution-based
 
02:38:22.130 --> 02:38:22.140 align:start position:0%
legislation perhaps till next year or
 
02:38:24.590 --> 02:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
who knows the we need to do something
 
02:38:26.929 --> 02:38:26.939 align:start position:0%
now to tell the field and I do think
 
02:38:28.490 --> 02:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
it'll keep some of the talent there I
 
02:38:30.650 --> 02:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
really do and that we really want to
 
02:38:32.630 --> 02:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
keep the talent as much as we can and
 
02:38:33.950 --> 02:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing with the empty
 
02:38:36.050 --> 02:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
classrooms uh representative King you
 
02:38:37.370 --> 02:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
mentioned about the home child care
 
02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
programs and how difficult it is right
 
02:38:42.410 --> 02:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
now and I don't have the number there's
 
02:38:44.450 --> 02:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
been no formal survey of how many Child
 
02:38:47.389 --> 02:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
Care classrooms are just empty right now
 
02:38:50.030 --> 02:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
they have the electricity the heat the
 
02:38:52.250 --> 02:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
toys the classroom they've got
 
02:38:54.110 --> 02:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
everything except the staff
 
02:38:55.730 --> 02:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
if we could do something there's
 
02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
incentives here for new staff Etc we
 
02:38:59.389 --> 02:38:59.399 align:start position:0%
might be able to start filling those
 
02:39:02.210 --> 02:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
back up and that will have an effect too
 
02:39:03.349 --> 02:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:06.110 --> 02:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
02:39:07.969 --> 02:39:07.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
question I'm kind of following up on
 
02:39:13.010 --> 02:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
what representative King asked um I know
 
02:39:15.349 --> 02:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
he asked about the
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
the overall covid-19 vaccine mandate not
 
02:39:21.889 --> 02:39:21.899 align:start position:0%
being a thing but is it a thing for
 
02:39:21.899 --> 02:39:24.170 align:start position:0%
being a thing but is it a thing for
individual

02:39:24.170 --> 02:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:39:26.690 --> 02:39:26.700 align:start position:0%
um Child Care Learning yeah so have have
 
02:39:29.750 --> 02:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of them made that decision to
 
02:39:31.969 --> 02:39:31.979 align:start position:0%
leave the field you mean no yes exactly
 
02:39:31.979 --> 02:39:33.110 align:start position:0%
leave the field you mean no yes exactly
yeah

02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question let me just
 
02:39:36.530 --> 02:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
okay they're better at this I haven't
 
02:39:37.969 --> 02:39:37.979 align:start position:0%
heard it put it that way that it's made
 
02:39:39.610 --> 02:39:39.620 align:start position:0%
a big difference in time
 
02:39:42.830 --> 02:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of covet of closing
 
02:39:44.210 --> 02:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
classrooms and not being able to get
 
02:39:45.650 --> 02:39:45.660 align:start position:0%
paid and all those sorts of things
 
02:39:47.090 --> 02:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
that's been tough but I don't think it's
 
02:39:49.130 --> 02:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
about a masking so let me or vaccination
 
02:39:51.950 --> 02:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
let me just ask yeah as the VAC has the
 
02:39:54.710 --> 02:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
masking or vaccination been an issue in
 
02:39:56.990 --> 02:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
losing staff I think at the beginning
 
02:40:01.210 --> 02:40:01.220 align:start position:0%
maybe a little okay right okay sorry
 
02:40:04.790 --> 02:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
yeah ah okay okay um but
 
02:40:06.530 --> 02:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I think there have been quite a bit
 
02:40:07.730 --> 02:40:07.740 align:start position:0%
of returns
 
02:40:09.710 --> 02:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
you know there was sort of a panic and a
 
02:40:11.090 --> 02:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding in the beginning of the
 
02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
of the March April May
 
02:40:15.410 --> 02:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
um in turn there have been some returns
 
02:40:17.389 --> 02:40:17.399 align:start position:0%
but I don't have that stats but right
 
02:40:20.270 --> 02:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
now the difficulty is simply
 
02:40:23.090 --> 02:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
um uh if you know and the state is
 
02:40:25.130 --> 02:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
trying to help with this that um parents
 
02:40:28.130 --> 02:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
you know parents if the classroom has to
 
02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
close but that's a whole separate you
 
02:40:33.250 --> 02:40:33.260 align:start position:0%
know follow-up follow-up thank you so
 
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
are there still centers
 
02:40:38.030 --> 02:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
implementing those mandates
 
02:40:40.130 --> 02:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
there may be representative I don't know
 
02:40:42.230 --> 02:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
it it's not often talked about or what's
 
02:40:43.730 --> 02:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
what's talked about is the difficulty of
 
02:40:45.830 --> 02:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
having to close a classroom down and
 
02:40:47.150 --> 02:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
parents not being able to have child
 
02:40:48.650 --> 02:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
care and staff not being able to get
 
02:40:50.889 --> 02:40:50.899 align:start position:0%
paid if they've got it but not about
 
02:40:54.670 --> 02:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
vaccinations or masking yeah
 
02:40:58.490 --> 02:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
follow another one I do yeah sure yeah
 
02:41:02.090 --> 02:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
so with that said that could be a real
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
issue for Staffing so has there been
 
02:41:06.889 --> 02:41:06.899 align:start position:0%
conversations around
 
02:41:08.690 --> 02:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
not closing down maybe you're not
 
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
dropping those to encourage people that
 
02:41:14.809 --> 02:41:14.819 align:start position:0%
may have left and what to come back and
 
02:41:16.429 --> 02:41:16.439 align:start position:0%

play New Hampshire and we're a Statewide
 
02:42:28.130 --> 02:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
non-profit whose mission is to attract
 
02:42:30.170 --> 02:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
and retain more young people here in the
 
02:42:32.450 --> 02:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
granite state and that's important um
 
02:42:34.370 --> 02:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
just to lay the groundwork uh for a few
 
02:42:36.050 --> 02:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
reasons one of which were the second
 
02:42:38.210 --> 02:42:38.220 align:start position:0%
oldest average age in the country here
 
02:42:39.469 --> 02:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire have one of the lowest
 
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates and one of the
 
02:42:43.070 --> 02:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
highest out migration rates of high
 
02:42:46.730 --> 02:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
school seniors we need more people in
 
02:42:48.290 --> 02:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
general here in New Hampshire we need
 
02:42:50.570 --> 02:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
more young people in particular and
 
02:42:52.429 --> 02:42:52.439 align:start position:0%
these are just some of the reasons that
 
02:42:54.410 --> 02:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
stay work play is in support of this
 
02:42:56.270 --> 02:42:56.280 align:start position:0%

02:42:59.450 --> 02:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
to support child care and the child care
 
02:43:02.690 --> 02:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
Workforce in particular young people you
 
02:43:04.370 --> 02:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
know here in New Hampshire you know are
 
02:43:06.590 --> 02:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
needed not just as we've heard as
 
02:43:09.530 --> 02:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
employees for our state's employers but
 
02:43:11.510 --> 02:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know to serve an elected office at
 
02:43:13.969 --> 02:43:13.979 align:start position:0%
the state and local level to serve local
 
02:43:17.090 --> 02:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
non-profits to pass the plate church or
 
02:43:19.130 --> 02:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
synagogue we need more people
 
02:43:21.349 --> 02:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
and uh for young people here in New
 
02:43:24.349 --> 02:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire child care as we've heard is a
 
02:43:26.510 --> 02:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
major issue and one of the reasons that
 
02:43:28.910 --> 02:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh we don't maybe have as many kids and
 
02:43:31.550 --> 02:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
one that you will encourage others to
 
02:43:33.530 --> 02:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
leave the state among others you know
 
02:43:35.809 --> 02:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
young people in New Hampshire face a
 
02:43:37.670 --> 02:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
number of challenges uh some of which we
 
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
all face some of which are unique to
 
02:43:41.570 --> 02:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
young people certainly you know we've
 
02:43:43.610 --> 02:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
all seen housing costs you know
 
02:43:45.290 --> 02:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
Skyrocket on the rental market in
 
02:43:48.170 --> 02:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
particular which are disproportionately
 
02:43:50.330 --> 02:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
occupied by young people we've seen
 
02:43:52.370 --> 02:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
utility costs you know increasing which
 
02:43:55.190 --> 02:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
affect us all young people in particular
 
02:43:57.290 --> 02:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
are more burdened with student debt
 
02:43:59.330 --> 02:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
having those payments and of course with
 
02:44:01.610 --> 02:44:01.620 align:start position:0%
child care you know being young people
 
02:44:04.010 --> 02:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
of child bearing age you know these all
 
02:44:05.630 --> 02:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
kind of you know come together to create
 
02:44:08.990 --> 02:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
really a perfect storm of challenges for
 
02:44:10.790 --> 02:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
for living in New Hampshire and being
 
02:44:13.250 --> 02:44:13.260 align:start position:0%
young and I'll leave you with this one
 
02:44:16.250 --> 02:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
anecdote that you heard from a young
 
02:44:18.290 --> 02:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
woman in the Upper Valley a few years
 
02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
ago when we were out of making the
 
02:44:21.469 --> 02:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
rounds you know talking to young people
 
02:44:23.090 --> 02:44:23.100 align:start position:0%
in each region of the state about you
 
02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
know what makes it a challenge you know
 
02:44:27.530 --> 02:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
to live in their in their regions of the
 
02:44:28.670 --> 02:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
state and what they like about it too
 
02:44:30.590 --> 02:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
and as I mentioned this one young woman
 
02:44:31.849 --> 02:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
was in the Upper Valley but I think the
 
02:44:33.650 --> 02:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
comment applies to New Hampshire as a
 
02:44:35.690 --> 02:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
whole she said you know the Upper Valley
 
02:44:38.330 --> 02:44:38.340 align:start position:0%
is a wonderful place to raise a family
 
02:44:41.090 --> 02:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
but it's a really terrible place to try
 
02:44:43.370 --> 02:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
and start one and you know that comment
 
02:44:44.929 --> 02:44:44.939 align:start position:0%
is one that's kind of stuck with me you
 
02:44:46.670 --> 02:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
know these past two or three years and
 
02:44:48.950 --> 02:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know really helps fuel me and our
 
02:44:51.050 --> 02:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
organization to do everything we can to
 
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
make New Hampshire you know more
 
02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
amenable for young people and easier to
 
02:44:56.570 --> 02:44:56.580 align:start position:0%
live here and of course that includes
 
02:44:58.250 --> 02:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
everything that we can do you know to
 
02:45:00.110 --> 02:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
lower the cost of child care you know
 
02:45:02.270 --> 02:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
for parents who don't um you're a little
 
02:45:03.889 --> 02:45:03.899 align:start position:0%
bit more challenged and being able to
 
02:45:07.130 --> 02:45:07.140 align:start position:0%
address those those price increases so
 
02:45:08.929 --> 02:45:08.939 align:start position:0%

bulletin recently had an article by
 
02:46:19.490 --> 02:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
Anne-Marie Timmons which uh mentioned
 
02:46:23.690 --> 02:46:23.700 align:start position:0%

Care folks were earning in Maine I might

chairman uh Mr Stewart uh thank you I I
 
02:48:02.510 --> 02:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
you presented a lot of facts that I
 
02:48:04.130 --> 02:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
thought sounded great but I'm wondering
 
02:48:07.550 --> 02:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
if you could send the main bullets of
 
02:48:10.969 --> 02:48:10.979 align:start position:0%
your oral testimony in writing somehow I
 
02:48:13.010 --> 02:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
would be happy to do that yes
 
02:48:16.730 --> 02:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:22.130 --> 02:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:23.990 --> 02:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify this morning
 
02:48:32.210 --> 02:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you for having us
 
02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
02:48:37.849 --> 02:48:37.859 align:start position:0%
um so my name is Lynn Willette I have
 
02:48:39.710 --> 02:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
been in the field of Early Childhood for
 
02:48:42.410 --> 02:48:42.420 align:start position:0%
41 years now I am a director at a school
 
02:48:44.090 --> 02:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
in Amherst New Hampshire called Nelly's
 
02:48:44.100 --> 02:48:45.290 align:start position:0%
in Amherst New Hampshire called Nelly's
treehouse

02:48:45.290 --> 02:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
treehouse
 
02:48:48.530 --> 02:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
I currently employ 15 employees
 
02:48:52.490 --> 02:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
I need 19 employees I have had ads out
 
02:48:54.770 --> 02:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
for months and months and months
 
02:48:57.770 --> 02:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
sometimes we hire someone they accept a
 
02:49:00.889 --> 02:49:00.899 align:start position:0%
position and they don't show up
 
02:49:03.469 --> 02:49:03.479 align:start position:0%
um in doing this for 41 years our
 
02:49:05.270 --> 02:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
primary goal is to make sure that the
 
02:49:06.889 --> 02:49:06.899 align:start position:0%
children in our care
 
02:49:10.429 --> 02:49:10.439 align:start position:0%
are loved and have consistency
 
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that they can learn appropriately
 
02:49:14.450 --> 02:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
that is not happening now
 
02:49:17.210 --> 02:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
it isn't covet that cause kovid started
 
02:49:19.130 --> 02:49:19.140 align:start position:0%
the problem but it's always been a
 
02:49:21.410 --> 02:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
problem but right now when I have an
 
02:49:22.969 --> 02:49:22.979 align:start position:0%
employee who comes in and I say I can
 
02:49:25.490 --> 02:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
offer you fifteen dollars an hour
 
02:49:27.590 --> 02:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
Target down the street is offering them
 
02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:29.150 align:start position:0%
Target down the street is offering them
20.

02:49:29.150 --> 02:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
20.
 
02:49:31.910 --> 02:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
I can't raise my parents class anymore
 
02:49:35.210 --> 02:49:35.220 align:start position:0%
and when I do raise their costs they
 
02:49:37.550 --> 02:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
have to consider their housing their
 
02:49:39.889 --> 02:49:39.899 align:start position:0%
electricity their food everything Rising
 
02:49:41.349 --> 02:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
for them
 
02:49:45.050 --> 02:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
my staff deserve to make a living wage
 
02:49:47.750 --> 02:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
I work in the classroom because we don't
 
02:49:49.190 --> 02:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
have staff
 
02:49:53.570 --> 02:49:53.580 align:start position:0%
I have a wait list of 87 children
 
02:49:55.969 --> 02:49:55.979 align:start position:0%
and on Monday because of my lack of
 
02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
Staffing I had to call two parents and
 
02:50:00.650 --> 02:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
say I'm really sorry but your children
 
02:50:03.349 --> 02:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
can't start next Monday and I'm not sure
 
02:50:05.090 --> 02:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
when they can start because I had a
 
02:50:07.309 --> 02:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
staff member who left to go work at
 
02:50:07.319 --> 02:50:08.270 align:start position:0%
staff member who left to go work at
Target

02:50:08.270 --> 02:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
Target
 
02:50:10.429 --> 02:50:10.439 align:start position:0%
and I had a staff member who took a job
 
02:50:12.410 --> 02:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
in a dental office
 
02:50:15.530 --> 02:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
for far more than I could pay them
 
02:50:18.230 --> 02:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
we need to help our families
 
02:50:21.230 --> 02:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a family-oriented state
 
02:50:23.630 --> 02:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
and our children deserve the best and if
 
02:50:26.389 --> 02:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
we want to work forth we need to support
 
02:50:29.090 --> 02:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
child care because we are that Workforce
 
02:50:31.610 --> 02:50:31.620 align:start position:0%
behind that Workforce
 
02:50:33.889 --> 02:50:33.899 align:start position:0%
are that the parent they called on
 
02:50:35.690 --> 02:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
Monday cried
 
02:50:38.809 --> 02:50:38.819 align:start position:0%
because she needs to go back to work
 
02:50:40.969 --> 02:50:40.979 align:start position:0%
and I can't help her because I don't
 
02:50:44.510 --> 02:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:46.610 --> 02:50:46.620 align:start position:0%
um we talked I know that there were a
 
02:50:48.830 --> 02:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
lot of questions about masking and covid
 
02:50:48.840 --> 02:50:50.210 align:start position:0%
lot of questions about masking and covid
and

02:50:50.210 --> 02:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:53.150 --> 02:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
um we just stopped masking in September
 
02:50:54.790 --> 02:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
for our staff
 
02:50:57.349 --> 02:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of our staff have voluntarily
 
02:50:59.570 --> 02:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
gotten all of their shots and we offered
 
02:51:02.510 --> 02:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
a stipend for them to do that if they
 
02:51:04.250 --> 02:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
did it
 
02:51:06.650 --> 02:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
um but it's not the end-all be-all
 
02:51:08.990 --> 02:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of our our staff are very
 
02:51:11.570 --> 02:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
dedicated to what they do
 
02:51:14.570 --> 02:51:14.580 align:start position:0%
um and if we don't stop and find a way
 
02:51:16.849 --> 02:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
to get people into this field we won't
 
02:51:19.730 --> 02:51:19.740 align:start position:0%
have a child care field in a few years
 
02:51:22.190 --> 02:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
so we appreciate you taking the time to
 
02:51:23.650 --> 02:51:23.660 align:start position:0%
listen to us
 
02:51:26.389 --> 02:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
we appreciate anything you can do for
 
02:51:28.130 --> 02:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
our field
 
02:51:30.170 --> 02:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
um I know three thousand dollars seems
 
02:51:32.809 --> 02:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
small but to some of my stuff that's a
 
02:51:35.929 --> 02:51:35.939 align:start position:0%
huge huge benefit
 
02:51:38.630 --> 02:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
um even if it's every five years
 
02:51:39.770 --> 02:51:39.780 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:51:42.469 --> 02:51:42.479 align:start position:0%
we want to provide the students of New
 
02:51:43.809 --> 02:51:43.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the children of New Hampshire
 
02:51:46.730 --> 02:51:46.740 align:start position:0%
with quality consistent care so that
 
02:51:48.590 --> 02:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
they can learn and grow we want to
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
provide New Hampshire with a consistent
 
02:51:53.269 --> 02:51:53.279 align:start position:0%
quality Workforce
 
02:51:55.849 --> 02:51:55.859 align:start position:0%
and we want to make sure that
 
02:51:57.530 --> 02:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
we're doing everything that we can to
 
02:51:59.050 --> 02:51:59.060 align:start position:0%
support our families here
 
02:52:01.490 --> 02:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
without having to tell someone on the
 
02:52:03.889 --> 02:52:03.899 align:start position:0%
phone hey I'm sorry I know you would do
 
02:52:05.510 --> 02:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
to start Monday but
 
02:52:08.570 --> 02:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
I can't take your child okay
 
02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
um and she has nowhere to go
 
02:52:12.710 --> 02:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome and
 
02:52:16.370 --> 02:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:18.769 --> 02:52:18.779 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions okay thank you very
 
02:52:18.779 --> 02:52:22.790 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions okay thank you very
much

02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:25.610 --> 02:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
also signed up to text uh to testify is
 
02:52:31.250 --> 02:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:33.530 --> 02:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
in a few minutes ma'am thank you hi I'm
 
02:52:34.670 --> 02:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
Marianne barter I'm the executive
 
02:52:36.170 --> 02:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
director at Merrimack Valley daycare
 
02:52:38.510 --> 02:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
service in Concord and I'm the chair of
 
02:52:39.769 --> 02:52:39.779 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Child Care advisory
 
02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
Council I just wanted to testify because
 
02:52:45.050 --> 02:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
I felt like I could explain a couple of
 
02:52:46.910 --> 02:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
the questions that have come up
 
02:52:48.889 --> 02:52:48.899 align:start position:0%
the first is that when I started in
 
02:52:51.710 --> 02:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
child care 20 years ago 21 years ago I
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
was offered 11 an hour there are still
 
02:52:55.849 --> 02:52:55.859 align:start position:0%
child care workers who are making 11 an
 
02:52:58.490 --> 02:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
hour and that's because the economics of
 
02:53:00.830 --> 02:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
child care does not allow salaries to
 
02:53:03.469 --> 02:53:03.479 align:start position:0%
match the raising cost the rising costs
 
02:53:05.210 --> 02:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it is expensive to live
 
02:53:05.220 --> 02:53:06.190 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it is expensive to live
here

02:53:06.190 --> 02:53:06.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:53:08.750 --> 02:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
our agency primarily works with
 
02:53:10.429 --> 02:53:10.439 align:start position:0%
low-income families Children at Risk of
 
02:53:11.750 --> 02:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect and children with
 
02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
special needs and I have never had a
 
02:53:17.929 --> 02:53:17.939 align:start position:0%
person come to my office and say they
 
02:53:19.370 --> 02:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
are leaving our Center because they
 
02:53:20.690 --> 02:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
don't believe in our mission but I've
 
02:53:22.130 --> 02:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
had plenty come and say they're leaving
 
02:53:25.010 --> 02:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
our Center to work at Target and I find
 
02:53:26.750 --> 02:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
the idea that people are passionate
 
02:53:28.370 --> 02:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
about this field and passionate for this
 
02:53:30.610 --> 02:53:30.620 align:start position:0%
work having to leave to work at Target
 
02:53:33.650 --> 02:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
incredibly depressing and it impacts all
 
02:53:35.870 --> 02:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
of us I am a non-profit agency so
 
02:53:38.510 --> 02:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the tax rebate wouldn't
 
02:53:39.889 --> 02:53:39.899 align:start position:0%
work for me but I think that that's
 
02:53:41.090 --> 02:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
something that's absolutely worth
 
02:53:44.630 --> 02:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
looking at to increase for-profit and
 
02:53:46.790 --> 02:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
proprietary centers as a way to improve
 
02:53:50.389 --> 02:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
increase their their financial
 
02:53:52.370 --> 02:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
their Financial Resources I think that's
 
02:53:55.490 --> 02:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
a great idea I did want to say that I
 
02:53:57.290 --> 02:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
can't raise wages I mean I can't raise
 
02:53:59.330 --> 02:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
salaries larger than they are I mean I'm
 
02:54:01.250 --> 02:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
sorry excuse me I can't raise tuition
 
02:54:03.590 --> 02:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
larger than it is because the bulk of my
 
02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
families fall within that range of being
 
02:54:07.849 --> 02:54:07.859 align:start position:0%
making too much money to get State
 
02:54:09.889 --> 02:54:09.899 align:start position:0%
assistance but too little money to
 
02:54:12.410 --> 02:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
really survive and thrive in New
 
02:54:15.110 --> 02:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I already give them a
 
02:54:17.150 --> 02:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
sliding fee scale and I know for a lot
 
02:54:20.030 --> 02:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
of those people they that Maxes them out
 
02:54:23.210 --> 02:54:23.220 align:start position:0%
we also have a food pantry on site and
 
02:54:24.889 --> 02:54:24.899 align:start position:0%
there's many many a time that I see the
 
02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
families come and pay me their tuition
 
02:54:28.490 --> 02:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
and then they visit our food pantry and
 
02:54:30.650 --> 02:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
that is disgraceful and the eighth
 
02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
richest state in New Hampshire in New
 
02:54:34.309 --> 02:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm sorry in the United States
 
02:54:37.370 --> 02:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
that is just unbelievable to me I also
 
02:54:39.290 --> 02:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention that we remained open
 
02:54:41.030 --> 02:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
during covid because so many of our
 
02:54:44.269 --> 02:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
families are low income and frankly they
 
02:54:46.250 --> 02:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
didn't have another option and because
 
02:54:48.530 --> 02:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
so many of my colleagues had to close
 
02:54:50.090 --> 02:54:50.100 align:start position:0%
that we really wanted a safe place for
 
02:54:52.730 --> 02:54:52.740 align:start position:0%
children come in the Concord area while
 
02:54:55.250 --> 02:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
the parents worked we also have a lot of
 
02:54:57.110 --> 02:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
protective children so we felt like that
 
02:54:59.450 --> 02:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
they needed a safe place to be while
 
02:55:01.030 --> 02:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
their parents worked on their issues
 
02:55:03.710 --> 02:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
during that time I never lost an
 
02:55:05.210 --> 02:55:05.220 align:start position:0%
employee due to any coveted related
 
02:55:07.849 --> 02:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
issues during that time afterwards I
 
02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
never gained an employee because of
 
02:55:11.929 --> 02:55:11.939 align:start position:0%
covert related issues we'd masked
 
02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes we didn't mask other times
 
02:55:16.070 --> 02:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
most people are probably vaccinated but
 
02:55:18.110 --> 02:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
I don't ask
 
02:55:19.849 --> 02:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
we're doing the best we can to serve our
 
02:55:22.309 --> 02:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
families I will say that in child care
 
02:55:24.889 --> 02:55:24.899 align:start position:0%
conversations I do not hear covid
 
02:55:27.469 --> 02:55:27.479 align:start position:0%
restrictions coming up very often
 
02:55:30.830 --> 02:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
so that's my testimony I hope that you
 
02:55:32.510 --> 02:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
folks see this bill the same way we see
 
02:55:34.370 --> 02:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
it which is a bridge to get us to the
 
02:55:36.349 --> 02:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
next step I think in four or five years
 
02:55:37.849 --> 02:55:37.859 align:start position:0%
Child Care New Hampshire is going to
 
02:55:40.070 --> 02:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
look extraordinarily different there's
 
02:55:42.590 --> 02:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
things in place and things that people
 
02:55:43.910 --> 02:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
are starting to talk about at the
 
02:55:46.550 --> 02:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
highest levels that will change the way
 
02:55:48.410 --> 02:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire handles child care I think
 
02:55:50.630 --> 02:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
that's amazing but we need to get there
 
02:55:52.969 --> 02:55:52.979 align:start position:0%
with an experienced Workforce in order
 
02:55:54.889 --> 02:55:54.899 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of these changes we're
 
02:55:56.269 --> 02:55:56.279 align:start position:0%
going to have an entire generation of
 
02:55:58.490 --> 02:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
children that do not have appropriate
 
02:56:01.150 --> 02:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
Safe Care during the day
 
02:56:03.950 --> 02:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
02:56:06.110 --> 02:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for and thank you for
 
02:56:07.730 --> 02:56:07.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:56:09.469 --> 02:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
um so there are educational Freedom
 
02:56:11.030 --> 02:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
accounts available in New Hampshire
 
02:56:12.469 --> 02:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:56:14.690 --> 02:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
um would any of the parents who utilize
 
02:56:17.389 --> 02:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
your Learning Center Services have you
 
02:56:19.490 --> 02:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
directed them to the use of those
 
02:56:20.990 --> 02:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
accounts are they available for
 
02:56:22.849 --> 02:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
preschool-aged children I mean they're
 
02:56:26.030 --> 02:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
Learning Centers you said so I guess I
 
02:56:28.190 --> 02:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
thought they were in lieu of Education a
 
02:56:30.110 --> 02:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
regular school yeah so I wonder how that
 
02:56:32.210 --> 02:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
like as a learning or if you're if
 
02:56:34.269 --> 02:56:34.279 align:start position:0%
you're in a teaching environment versus
 
02:56:37.610 --> 02:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
Child Care yeah I mean I think the
 
02:56:40.010 --> 02:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
distinction between child care and and
 
02:56:42.769 --> 02:56:42.779 align:start position:0%
public education that's always been sort
 
02:56:45.469 --> 02:56:45.479 align:start position:0%
of a funny relationship we would have to
 
02:56:47.090 --> 02:56:47.100 align:start position:0%
investigate that further I've certainly
 
02:56:49.250 --> 02:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
never heard of anyone successfully using
 
02:56:51.950 --> 02:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
the freedom care accounts I don't
 
02:56:56.269 --> 02:56:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:00.830 --> 02:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:04.020 --> 02:57:04.030 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:04.030 --> 02:57:05.690 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:57:05.690 --> 02:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:57:07.309 --> 02:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
12 million dollars into their General
 
02:57:10.010 --> 02:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
budget for supporting Child Care
 
02:57:12.349 --> 02:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
Workforce and the way they do that is
 
02:57:14.090 --> 02:57:14.100 align:start position:0%
that every month a child care provider
 
02:57:15.950 --> 02:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
every individual teacher and provider
 
02:57:19.010 --> 02:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
receives a 200 stipend
 
02:57:21.469 --> 02:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
so um and that has increased retention
 
02:57:21.479 --> 02:57:24.769 align:start position:0%
so um and that has increased retention
exponentially

02:57:24.769 --> 02:57:24.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:27.170 --> 02:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:57:29.870 --> 02:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm sorry representative
 
02:57:29.880 --> 02:57:33.650 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm sorry representative
Weber

02:57:33.650 --> 02:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:35.929 --> 02:57:35.939 align:start position:0%
and would you be surprised to know that
 
02:57:38.389 --> 02:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
for that extra two hundred dollars that
 
02:57:41.630 --> 02:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
the main teachers are getting uh for 30
 
02:57:43.429 --> 02:57:43.439 align:start position:0%
of that to go to the federal government
 
02:57:45.590 --> 02:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
the teacher would have to be making more
 
02:57:47.150 --> 02:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
than a hundred and seventy thousand
 
02:57:51.230 --> 02:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:53.750 --> 02:57:53.760 align:start position:0%

and the last person signed up to testify
 
02:58:19.130 --> 02:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
in this bill this morning is Sebastian
 
02:58:21.410 --> 02:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
and I apologize if I mispronounced the
 
02:58:23.630 --> 02:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
last name Fuentes you got it right oh
 
02:58:25.550 --> 02:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
excellent okay I'm doing well thank you
 
02:58:27.050 --> 02:58:27.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you members of the
 
02:58:28.730 --> 02:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
committee uh once again my name is
 
02:58:30.230 --> 02:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
Sebastian Fuentes I'm the movement
 
02:58:32.030 --> 02:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
politics director for rice in democracy
 
02:58:34.010 --> 02:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire but I'm your most
 
02:58:35.210 --> 02:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
importantly to kind of representing
 
02:58:37.910 --> 02:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
myself I have four kids myself um two of
 
02:58:40.370 --> 02:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
them are three and two years old uh the
 
02:58:41.990 --> 02:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
only reason why I have this job and I'm
 
02:58:44.090 --> 02:58:44.100 align:start position:0%
able to do this job is because my wife
 
02:58:46.250 --> 02:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
has to work three shifts 12-hour shifts
 
02:58:48.530 --> 02:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
overnight so uh somebody can take care
 
02:58:50.210 --> 02:58:50.220 align:start position:0%
of our children and why is that it's
 
02:58:52.790 --> 02:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
because we cannot afford the 640 a week
 
02:58:55.550 --> 02:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
to take care for two two kids on a
 
02:58:58.070 --> 02:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
daycare system so I'm here to in support
 
02:58:59.630 --> 02:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
of this bill to see if you guys can
 
02:59:01.790 --> 02:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
provide the right amount of support to
 
02:59:03.170 --> 02:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
the child care workers that need it so
 
02:59:05.330 --> 02:59:05.340 align:start position:0%
much another thing for 20 years of my
 
02:59:07.010 --> 02:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
life I work in the hospitality industry
 
02:59:08.690 --> 02:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
up in the North Country representative
 
02:59:10.250 --> 02:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
King might be aware of Mount Washington
 
02:59:12.410 --> 02:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
hotel is one of the largest employers up
 
02:59:15.230 --> 02:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
there many times and I can count about
 
02:59:16.969 --> 02:59:16.979 align:start position:0%
maybe 50 to 60 people that we
 
02:59:18.590 --> 02:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
interviewed throughout 10 years that
 
02:59:20.570 --> 02:59:20.580 align:start position:0%
have to leave the area or cannot take a
 
02:59:22.610 --> 02:59:22.620 align:start position:0%
job because they cannot find Child Care
 
02:59:24.590 --> 02:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
available in the area and whatever is
 
02:59:26.929 --> 02:59:26.939 align:start position:0%
available is not affordable so whatever
 
02:59:29.030 --> 02:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
you guys that this community can do to
 
02:59:30.830 --> 02:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
help the child care workers in New
 
02:59:31.610 --> 02:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that would be greatly
 
02:59:33.230 --> 02:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
appreciated so that's all my testimony
 
02:59:35.929 --> 02:59:35.939 align:start position:0%
uh I think many of them uh give the good
 
02:59:37.670 --> 02:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
perspectives but I wanted to give the
 
02:59:39.950 --> 02:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
another one as a parent of somebody that
 
02:59:41.929 --> 02:59:41.939 align:start position:0%

04:04:22.250 --> 04:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
terms of testifying is the prime sponsor
 
04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:35.510 --> 04:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:04:37.849 --> 04:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for hearing
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:43.790 --> 04:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
I'm in strong support of this bill and
 
04:04:45.349 --> 04:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a little bit of background
 
04:04:47.929 --> 04:04:47.939 align:start position:0%
but I really have some experts here from
 
04:04:50.330 --> 04:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hunger Solutions in the
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:04:55.130 --> 04:04:55.140 align:start position:0%
that can get into the nitty-gritty but
 
04:04:58.429 --> 04:04:58.439 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is provides an
 
04:05:02.510 --> 04:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people women infants and
 
04:05:06.290 --> 04:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
children to get fresh produce at their
 
04:05:08.269 --> 04:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
local farmers markets
 
04:05:10.550 --> 04:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
the coupons will be used
 
04:05:14.450 --> 04:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
that they now use in existing grocery
 
04:05:14.460 --> 04:05:15.410 align:start position:0%
that they now use in existing grocery
stores

04:05:15.410 --> 04:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
stores
 
04:05:17.689 --> 04:05:17.699 align:start position:0%
federal funds will support a hundred
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
percent of the food costs 70 percent of
 
04:05:22.910 --> 04:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
the administrative cost
 
04:05:25.309 --> 04:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
Bill appropriates three hundred thousand
 
04:05:28.189 --> 04:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
for administration and enhancement of
 
04:05:31.010 --> 04:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
the WIC Foundation providing an
 
04:05:33.290 --> 04:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
additional thirty dollars in benefits to
 
04:05:35.870 --> 04:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
be used at farmers markets
 
04:05:38.030 --> 04:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
the state match will draw down federal
 
04:05:40.670 --> 04:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
funds determined annually from the
 
04:05:42.830 --> 04:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
federal budget Appropriations
 
04:05:46.130 --> 04:05:46.140 align:start position:0%
and it will improve the awareness use of
 
04:05:49.309 --> 04:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
and sales of farmers markets so not only
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
will it help those people
 
04:05:53.990 --> 04:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
that have an economic need it will help
 
04:05:56.210 --> 04:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
our Farmers have another Outlet
 
04:05:58.910 --> 04:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
for product
 
04:06:02.210 --> 04:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
why do we do this now farmers markets
 
04:06:04.849 --> 04:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
infrastructure exists in the state to
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
support the program
 
04:06:09.950 --> 04:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
there is an increased interest among
 
04:06:13.189 --> 04:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
farmers and recipients in this program
 
04:06:15.290 --> 04:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor has just
 
04:06:17.750 --> 04:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
reported that over six percent in food
 
04:06:19.790 --> 04:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
costs have increased in the last 12
 
04:06:19.800 --> 04:06:21.170 align:start position:0%
costs have increased in the last 12
months

04:06:21.170 --> 04:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
months
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
and allowing the federal nutrition
 
04:06:25.849 --> 04:06:25.859 align:start position:0%
program participants to spend dollars at
 
04:06:28.610 --> 04:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
farmers markets may be the only way to
 
04:06:31.250 --> 04:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
increase market share for Farmers by
 
04:06:34.309 --> 04:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
connecting them to new customers
 
04:06:36.769 --> 04:06:36.779 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions but
 
04:06:39.530 --> 04:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
I'm probably going to duck out and refer
 
04:06:42.349 --> 04:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
to the experts behind you but if you do
 
04:06:43.670 --> 04:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
have questions
 
04:06:45.950 --> 04:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to take representative
 
04:06:48.110 --> 04:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
Leon um thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
you representative for being here and
 
04:06:52.070 --> 04:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
holding over through lunch my question
 
04:06:53.929 --> 04:06:53.939 align:start position:0%
is regarding the federal funds and if
 
04:06:56.150 --> 04:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
you would be willing to have a sunset
 
04:06:57.410 --> 04:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
provision that should the federal
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
funding go away this program also leaves
 
04:07:02.030 --> 04:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
our statutes
 
04:07:05.450 --> 04:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
I think I'm in favor of most legislation
 
04:07:08.750 --> 04:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
having a sunset thing so yes I think we
 
04:07:11.150 --> 04:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
would and just in speaking with the
 
04:07:13.550 --> 04:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
people from the Department if there is
 
04:07:14.809 --> 04:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
no uh
 
04:07:17.450 --> 04:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
demand for this program they would be
 
04:07:19.309 --> 04:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
willing to not apply for the federal
 
04:07:22.070 --> 04:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
fronts and have it lapse too so it's a
 
04:07:24.889 --> 04:07:24.899 align:start position:0%
two-way street thank you
 
04:07:26.990 --> 04:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:07:30.110 --> 04:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman also thank you
 
04:07:32.750 --> 04:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative well for taking the
 
04:07:32.760 --> 04:07:33.590 align:start position:0%
representative well for taking the
question

04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:07:36.170 --> 04:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
so basically this is going to support
 
04:07:38.090 --> 04:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
our local farmers more than we have
 
04:07:40.610 --> 04:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
today is that kind of the intent of it
 
04:07:43.849 --> 04:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
to not only help recipients of whip WIC
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
04:07:47.330 --> 04:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
to obtain fresh vegetables and fruits
 
04:07:49.250 --> 04:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
and so forth but also to help support
 
04:07:50.750 --> 04:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
our farming Community particularly them
 
04:07:52.969 --> 04:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
many of them are small farmers that
 
04:07:56.510 --> 04:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:08:01.969 --> 04:08:01.979 align:start position:0%
um yes to me it's a win-win situation
 
04:08:04.969 --> 04:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
people that are on the low income
 
04:08:08.689 --> 04:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
Spectrum can get fresh produce locally
 
04:08:12.110 --> 04:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
and our farmers can now provide for them
 
04:08:12.120 --> 04:08:14.090 align:start position:0%
and our farmers can now provide for them
so

04:08:14.090 --> 04:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:08:16.790 --> 04:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know why this uh
 
04:08:21.950 --> 04:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:25.189 --> 04:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:27.290 --> 04:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions yes
 
04:08:27.300 --> 04:08:29.150 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions yes
representative

04:08:29.150 --> 04:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:08:30.710 --> 04:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:33.290 --> 04:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
um so it's my understanding it says it's
 
04:08:36.110 --> 04:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
re-establishing so this is restarting
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
something that existed previously
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding
 
04:08:44.750 --> 04:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
it was it was in it
 
04:08:48.170 --> 04:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
I believe it was a two-year program and
 
04:08:50.150 --> 04:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
it did expire and now it's
 
04:08:54.050 --> 04:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:58.189 --> 04:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:00.170 --> 04:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
04:09:01.429 --> 04:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
for chair
 
04:09:02.990 --> 04:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question just
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
real quick um line six on the second
 
04:09:07.010 --> 04:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
page it says the program shall
 
04:09:09.950 --> 04:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
distribute food instruments
 
04:09:13.250 --> 04:09:13.260 align:start position:0%
is that is that just food or what is
 
04:09:20.330 --> 04:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:22.370 --> 04:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
I'd have to ask the people that helped
 
04:09:25.429 --> 04:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:25.439 --> 04:09:30.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:09:30.530 --> 04:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:30.540 --> 04:09:32.330 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:09:32.330 --> 04:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:35.929 --> 04:09:35.939 align:start position:0%
well yes representative Weber
 
04:09:38.510 --> 04:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
could I ask that we finish with one
 
04:09:41.210 --> 04:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
person's testimony before and if if
 
04:09:43.250 --> 04:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
somebody has a question that needs to go
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
to somebody else that they'd be asked to
 
04:09:46.130 --> 04:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
hold it because otherwise we have people
 
04:09:48.170 --> 04:09:48.180 align:start position:0%
popping up and then popping down and we
 
04:09:49.790 --> 04:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
get into conversations that are
 
04:09:52.429 --> 04:09:52.439 align:start position:0%
confusing yeah so uh representative wolf
 
04:09:54.349 --> 04:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
are you are you I apologize any other
 
04:09:55.689 --> 04:09:55.699 align:start position:0%
questions for representative wolf
 
04:09:58.450 --> 04:09:58.460 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
04:10:01.370 --> 04:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr and also Mr President of
 
04:10:03.530 --> 04:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
wolf I see this as a non-lapsing account
 
04:10:06.290 --> 04:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
and it goes until the end of
 
04:10:10.130 --> 04:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:12.650 --> 04:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
would it be opposed to making a
 
04:10:14.570 --> 04:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
lapsing account versus an unlapsing
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
account so and give it a time of 2025 so
 
04:10:20.210 --> 04:10:20.220 align:start position:0%
the funds have to be expended by that
 
04:10:21.650 --> 04:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
period of time would you be opposed to
 
04:10:23.210 --> 04:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
that versus it being a non-lapsing
 
04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:31.910 --> 04:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be opposed to that
 
04:10:34.070 --> 04:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
I think that's some of the things that
 
04:10:36.889 --> 04:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
the Department's going to speak to
 
04:10:41.210 --> 04:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
do you know other questions
 
04:10:44.689 --> 04:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you thank you
 
04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:49.790 --> 04:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
and since she had already tried to come
 
04:10:51.950 --> 04:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
up here once I'd like to recognize Lisa
 
04:10:53.750 --> 04:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
cervoice from the New Hampshire
 
04:10:55.130 --> 04:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:10:57.889 --> 04:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health who continue
 
04:11:00.050 --> 04:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
and we could keep your testimony to
 
04:11:01.729 --> 04:11:01.739 align:start position:0%
three minutes that'd be great
 
04:11:03.889 --> 04:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and committee
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
members my name is Lisa Royce bierschi
 
04:11:08.570 --> 04:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
for population Health prior to this
 
04:11:11.210 --> 04:11:11.220 align:start position:0%
position I have been the WIC director at
 
04:11:12.469 --> 04:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health for the
 
04:11:14.269 --> 04:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
last six years so even in my new
 
04:11:17.269 --> 04:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
position I still oversee this program so
 
04:11:19.189 --> 04:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
just really quickly to lay the
 
04:11:21.110 --> 04:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
foundation so the WIC nutrition program
 
04:11:24.349 --> 04:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
is a 100 federally funded Public Health
 
04:11:27.050 --> 04:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
Nutrition program for low-income infants
 
04:11:29.570 --> 04:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
children pregnant and breastfeeding
 
04:11:29.580 --> 04:11:30.530 align:start position:0%
children pregnant and breastfeeding
women

04:11:30.530 --> 04:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
women
 
04:11:32.809 --> 04:11:32.819 align:start position:0%
our program is different than other food
 
04:11:34.790 --> 04:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
access programs because we provide very
 
04:11:37.030 --> 04:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
prescriptive Foods whole wheat bread
 
04:11:41.090 --> 04:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
low-fat milk beans peanut butter infant
 
04:11:44.210 --> 04:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
formula focused very much on
 
04:11:46.429 --> 04:11:46.439 align:start position:0%
the period of pregnancy breastfeeding
 
04:11:48.469 --> 04:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
and Child Development to get to healthy
 
04:11:48.479 --> 04:11:49.490 align:start position:0%
and Child Development to get to healthy
outcomes

04:11:49.490 --> 04:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
04:11:52.429 --> 04:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
so the WIC Farmers Market program is an
 
04:11:55.070 --> 04:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
add-on that is available for states that
 
04:11:56.809 --> 04:11:56.819 align:start position:0%
participate in the WIC program
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
all 50 states participate there's
 
04:12:00.769 --> 04:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
actually 89 programs across the country
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
because it's available for
 
04:12:06.170 --> 04:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
Indian tribal councils and territories
 
04:12:08.210 --> 04:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
the program in New Hampshire last
 
04:12:11.570 --> 04:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
existed in 2011. it is a non-competitive
 
04:12:14.210 --> 04:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
program that's available for States back
 
04:12:16.849 --> 04:12:16.859 align:start position:0%
in 2011 the decision was made
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
to close the program because the
 
04:12:21.650 --> 04:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
Redemption levels were low
 
04:12:23.210 --> 04:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
and because of the state match
 
04:12:25.490 --> 04:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
requirement was no longer available to
 
04:12:26.570 --> 04:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
the program
 
04:12:29.389 --> 04:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
so under this bill it would re-establish
 
04:12:31.849 --> 04:12:31.859 align:start position:0%
the program although it still requires
 
04:12:33.290 --> 04:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
permission from the United States
 
04:12:35.750 --> 04:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture which we
 
04:12:37.550 --> 04:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
submit a state plan to each year what
 
04:12:39.830 --> 04:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
gives us permission and then gives us
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
some federal funding
 
04:12:43.550 --> 04:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
however we can't draw down that federal
 
04:12:46.250 --> 04:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
funds unless we can show that we have a
 
04:12:48.889 --> 04:12:48.899 align:start position:0%
match piece the match piece is about 30
 
04:12:51.410 --> 04:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
of the administrative grant that we
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
receive and just to put it in
 
04:12:56.450 --> 04:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
perspective in federal 22 while we
 
04:12:58.969 --> 04:12:58.979 align:start position:0%
didn't operate the program we sent in a
 
04:13:01.130 --> 04:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
proposal to get permission to bring it
 
04:13:02.510 --> 04:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
back to New Hampshire
 
04:13:04.490 --> 04:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
we received a hundred and ten thousand
 
04:13:06.050 --> 04:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
dollars for food
 
04:13:10.010 --> 04:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
in about 23 000 for administrative costs
 
04:13:12.050 --> 04:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
which would then require about a ten
 
04:13:14.030 --> 04:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar State match in order to
 
04:13:14.040 --> 04:13:15.170 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar State match in order to
operate

04:13:15.170 --> 04:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
operate
 
04:13:17.269 --> 04:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
the federal money that is given to us
 
04:13:20.150 --> 04:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
would only allow a ten dollar benefit to
 
04:13:22.010 --> 04:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
be given to each child on the WIC
 
04:13:25.490 --> 04:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
program which is about ten thousand kids
 
04:13:29.030 --> 04:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
so you can see that going to a farmer's
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
market with only ten dollars for your
 
04:13:33.290 --> 04:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
one child you maybe are going to get a
 
04:13:35.330 --> 04:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
pint of blueberries or two pints of
 
04:13:37.790 --> 04:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
strawberries so it's not as much of a
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
draw for families to travel to a
 
04:13:42.290 --> 04:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
farmer's market and use the benefit so
 
04:13:44.990 --> 04:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
under this bill this additional funding
 
04:13:47.269 --> 04:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
the 300 000 per year
 
04:13:50.990 --> 04:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
would give an additional 270 000 just to
 
04:13:52.729 --> 04:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
the food benefit which would go directly
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
to our New Hampshire farmers
 
04:13:57.830 --> 04:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
and then 30 000 to help with the
 
04:13:59.330 --> 04:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
administrative costs
 
04:14:02.030 --> 04:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
now within the last couple of weeks the
 
04:14:03.590 --> 04:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
United States Department of Agriculture
 
04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
has shared that there are modernization
 
04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
grants available for states to try to
 
04:14:10.370 --> 04:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
move the WIC Farmers Market program away
 
04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
from this paper coupon system to an
 
04:14:16.250 --> 04:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
electronic benefit system which could be
 
04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
a QR code on your phone or a plastic
 
04:14:21.050 --> 04:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
card which would help with redemptions
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
and allow Farmers to get paid a lot
 
04:14:23.520 --> 04:14:24.769 align:start position:0%
and allow Farmers to get paid a lot
faster

04:14:24.769 --> 04:14:24.779 align:start position:0%
faster
 
04:14:28.010 --> 04:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
so the term food instrument is very
 
04:14:30.290 --> 04:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
old-fashioned but it still exists in our
 
04:14:32.990 --> 04:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
federal regulations it is generic enough
 
04:14:35.450 --> 04:14:35.460 align:start position:0%
that it allows states to have paper
 
04:14:38.330 --> 04:14:38.340 align:start position:0%
coupons checks through banking systems
 
04:14:41.630 --> 04:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
or electronic benefits which could be a
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
plastic card or a QR code if you could
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
start wrapping up sure
 
04:14:46.800 --> 04:14:47.750 align:start position:0%
start wrapping up sure
um

04:14:47.750 --> 04:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
so so under this bill this funding would
 
04:14:52.429 --> 04:14:52.439 align:start position:0%
allow participants pregnant
 
04:14:55.070 --> 04:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding low-income children up to
 
04:14:58.370 --> 04:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
age five to visit a farmer's market for
 
04:15:02.090 --> 04:15:02.100 align:start position:0%
a one-time benefit of thirty dollars so
 
04:15:04.010 --> 04:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
the ten dollars from the federal money
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
and then the additional twenty dollars
 
04:15:07.969 --> 04:15:07.979 align:start position:0%
from the the state appropriation
 
04:15:09.950 --> 04:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
to be redeemed for fresh fruits and
 
04:15:12.410 --> 04:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
vegetables at farmers market in the
 
04:15:14.929 --> 04:15:14.939 align:start position:0%
intent of the WIC Farmers Market program
 
04:15:17.870 --> 04:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
is exactly what was stated it is to help
 
04:15:19.849 --> 04:15:19.859 align:start position:0%
low-income families access fresh fruits
 
04:15:22.370 --> 04:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
and vegetables at farmers market and
 
04:15:25.070 --> 04:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
equally to support our farming our
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
farming industry in this country
 
04:15:28.610 --> 04:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
specifically for us here in New
 
04:15:28.620 --> 04:15:29.450 align:start position:0%
specifically for us here in New
Hampshire

04:15:29.450 --> 04:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:15:31.070 --> 04:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm available for any questions
 
04:15:34.189 --> 04:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Leon
 
04:15:35.689 --> 04:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:15:38.330 --> 04:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
for being here my question is if it's
 
04:15:41.269 --> 04:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
possible to make any requests to the
 
04:15:42.889 --> 04:15:42.899 align:start position:0%
federal government to allow this to be
 
04:15:45.530 --> 04:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
in a more direct person to Farmer
 
04:15:48.050 --> 04:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
relationship because I know that at
 
04:15:49.550 --> 04:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
least some farmers markets have price
 
04:15:51.110 --> 04:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
fixing and it's probably the most
 
04:15:53.389 --> 04:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
expensive way to deliver fresh produce
 
04:15:55.490 --> 04:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
to people and if there's some exemption
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
to allow a process other than a farmer's
 
04:15:59.090 --> 04:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
market to get food from the farmers
 
04:16:01.490 --> 04:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
directly to the families
 
04:16:03.950 --> 04:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your question
 
04:16:05.689 --> 04:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I exactly understand
 
04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
what you're asking are you asking as
 
04:16:10.370 --> 04:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
opposed to at the markets at like
 
04:16:13.250 --> 04:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
grocery stores uh no I'm asking I'm
 
04:16:15.769 --> 04:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
sorry if I can answer that if they have
 
04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
a farm stand at the farm or some other
 
04:16:20.030 --> 04:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
way that the farmers market their food
 
04:16:22.130 --> 04:16:22.140 align:start position:0%
to the public if there's some other way
 
04:16:23.929 --> 04:16:23.939 align:start position:0%
to do it without the added cost of
 
04:16:25.490 --> 04:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
picking up the produce going to the
 
04:16:28.250 --> 04:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
farmers market that then requires people
 
04:16:30.290 --> 04:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
to get to that same place at the same
 
04:16:32.090 --> 04:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
time and there's a lot of food waste
 
04:16:34.130 --> 04:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
that's involved is there any way to get
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
a waiver to allow that to go to farm
 
04:16:37.490 --> 04:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
stands or other ways where it can be
 
04:16:39.290 --> 04:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
better integrated into the community to
 
04:16:42.349 --> 04:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
lower costs and increase access yes so
 
04:16:44.450 --> 04:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
under the federal WIC Farmers Market
 
04:16:47.330 --> 04:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
program there are State options that
 
04:16:50.929 --> 04:16:50.939 align:start position:0%
allow you to choose just markets Farm
 
04:16:55.250 --> 04:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
stands stand-alone farmer locations so
 
04:16:56.990 --> 04:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
it would give the department some
 
04:16:59.030 --> 04:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
authority to make a decision what is the
 
04:17:01.070 --> 04:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
best fit for our state in order to get
 
04:17:03.110 --> 04:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
these benefits fits to our families
 
04:17:04.969 --> 04:17:04.979 align:start position:0%
that's incredibly helpful thank you
 
04:17:07.269 --> 04:17:07.279 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you other questions
 
04:17:10.010 --> 04:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
 
04:17:15.050 --> 04:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
um you said the program died in 2011
 
04:17:15.060 --> 04:17:16.370 align:start position:0%
um you said the program died in 2011
sorry

04:17:16.370 --> 04:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:17:18.650 --> 04:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
um because of low Redemption
 
04:17:18.660 --> 04:17:19.550 align:start position:0%
um because of low Redemption
um

04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:21.769 --> 04:17:21.779 align:start position:0%
what was the reason for that and what's
 
04:17:23.870 --> 04:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
changed do you think sure yeah good
 
04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
question thank you so I wasn't in this
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
position in 2011 however I was still at
 
04:17:30.830 --> 04:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
the department working under the program
 
04:17:33.889 --> 04:17:33.899 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that getting
 
04:17:35.750 --> 04:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
those match dollars became more
 
04:17:38.090 --> 04:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
difficult for the department and the
 
04:17:40.429 --> 04:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
Redemption rates were around under 50
 
04:17:43.130 --> 04:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
percent and so at that time they were
 
04:17:45.710 --> 04:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
paper coupons that required families to
 
04:17:48.290 --> 04:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
go to the markets and redeem them we
 
04:17:50.630 --> 04:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
have seen over the past five years more
 
04:17:52.969 --> 04:17:52.979 align:start position:0%
programs across the state move to an
 
04:17:56.450 --> 04:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
e-solution more of a modernized version
 
04:17:58.610 --> 04:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
of Farmers Market which has allowed the
 
04:18:00.050 --> 04:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
Redemption rates to increase
 
04:18:02.750 --> 04:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
significantly so we we feel pretty
 
04:18:04.849 --> 04:18:04.859 align:start position:0%
confident that moving to a modern
 
04:18:06.769 --> 04:18:06.779 align:start position:0%
version would really help those
 
04:18:09.050 --> 04:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
Redemption rates
 
04:18:09.060 --> 04:18:10.130 align:start position:0%
Redemption rates
okay

04:18:10.130 --> 04:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:18:12.530 --> 04:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
04:18:14.210 --> 04:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and also thank you
 
04:18:15.889 --> 04:18:15.899 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
04:18:18.530 --> 04:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
the one time is it like one time per
 
04:18:20.750 --> 04:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
month one time per year can you
 
04:18:22.969 --> 04:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
help clarify the one time what that
 
04:18:25.010 --> 04:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
means sure thank you for that question I
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
I should have explained that better so
 
04:18:30.050 --> 04:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
it is a one-time benefit for the
 
04:18:32.689 --> 04:18:32.699 align:start position:0%
participant to be able to use be used
 
04:18:35.570 --> 04:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
over the lifetime of the market season
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
so ideally participants would be issued
 
04:18:40.910 --> 04:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
the benefit in June and they'd have
 
04:18:44.570 --> 04:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
until October to redeem the benefit at
 
04:18:46.490 --> 04:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
the end of October the benefit then
 
04:18:49.130 --> 04:18:49.140 align:start position:0%
however expires it's no longer available
 
04:18:51.229 --> 04:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
which is very much the way the WIC
 
04:18:53.210 --> 04:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
program works you get food for one month
 
04:18:57.189 --> 04:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
it expires there is no carry forward
 
04:18:59.510 --> 04:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Palazzo and I'll come
 
04:19:01.910 --> 04:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
back over here thank you Mr chair and
 
04:19:04.010 --> 04:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question my
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
concern is
 
04:19:09.050 --> 04:19:09.060 align:start position:0%
um if there will be a limit for healthy
 
04:19:11.750 --> 04:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
food versus unhealthy food and
 
04:19:14.450 --> 04:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
specifically my concern is uh you
 
04:19:19.010 --> 04:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
mentioned low fat milk as a specifically
 
04:19:21.349 --> 04:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
healthy choice so do you envision
 
04:19:23.809 --> 04:19:23.819 align:start position:0%
putting some limitations on
 
04:19:27.410 --> 04:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
participating Farmers if they provide
 
04:19:31.309 --> 04:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
whole milk or if they provide butter or
 
04:19:31.319 --> 04:19:32.570 align:start position:0%
whole milk or if they provide butter or
eggs

04:19:32.570 --> 04:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
eggs
 
04:19:35.330 --> 04:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question so my
 
04:19:37.550 --> 04:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
reference to the healthy foods is
 
04:19:39.889 --> 04:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
specific to the WIC nutrition program
 
04:19:41.750 --> 04:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
which is a separate benefit that
 
04:19:44.030 --> 04:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
families receive participating in that
 
04:19:47.830 --> 04:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
program WIC Farmers Market is solely for
 
04:19:51.889 --> 04:19:51.899 align:start position:0%
fresh local produce fruits vegetables
 
04:19:54.650 --> 04:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
some fresh cut herbs there is no
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
authorization for honey or baked goods
 
04:19:59.150 --> 04:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
or milk or any other Foods maybe that
 
04:20:02.510 --> 04:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:04.189 --> 04:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:20:06.229 --> 04:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:20:08.510 --> 04:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
my question so just another quick one
 
04:20:11.090 --> 04:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
another so would every farmer be
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
required to participate or is it opt-in
 
04:20:17.689 --> 04:20:17.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:19.370 --> 04:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:20:22.010 --> 04:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
04:20:24.170 --> 04:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I have a question for
 
04:20:27.170 --> 04:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
clarification because you said in answer
 
04:20:29.090 --> 04:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
to a question about is this just farmers
 
04:20:29.100 --> 04:20:30.769 align:start position:0%
to a question about is this just farmers
markets

04:20:30.769 --> 04:20:30.779 align:start position:0%
markets
 
04:20:34.370 --> 04:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
um uh that it could be individual Farm
 
04:20:37.670 --> 04:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
stands and it can also be used under the
 
04:20:39.650 --> 04:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
federal program guidelines it could be
 
04:20:41.170 --> 04:20:41.180 align:start position:0%
used at
 
04:20:43.790 --> 04:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
I believe grocery stores as well I mean
 
04:20:45.349 --> 04:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
we've had an iteration of this that
 
04:20:47.389 --> 04:20:47.399 align:start position:0%
included both local produce grocery
 
04:20:50.349 --> 04:20:50.359 align:start position:0%
stores and local produce other places
 
04:20:54.710 --> 04:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
but would we not have to amend this bill
 
04:20:57.910 --> 04:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
because the bill speaks
 
04:21:03.170 --> 04:21:03.180 align:start position:0%
only to distribute food in instruments
 
04:21:06.349 --> 04:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
to redeem for locally grown fruits
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
vegetables and herbs at authorized New
 
04:21:10.370 --> 04:21:10.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's farmers markets so it
 
04:21:12.050 --> 04:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be left to the department to
 
04:21:14.269 --> 04:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
decide in that case would it unless we
 
04:21:16.550 --> 04:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
revised the language here thank you for
 
04:21:17.929 --> 04:21:17.939 align:start position:0%
your question and asking for that
 
04:21:20.750 --> 04:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
clarification maybe I misspoke or when I
 
04:21:22.610 --> 04:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
was asking representative Leon for
 
04:21:22.620 --> 04:21:23.990 align:start position:0%
was asking representative Leon for
clarification

04:21:23.990 --> 04:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
um it became confusing this program does
 
04:21:29.090 --> 04:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
not allow the food instrument to be
 
04:21:31.490 --> 04:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
redeemed at a grocery store okay it is
 
04:21:34.790 --> 04:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
only markets Farm stands Farmers solely
 
04:21:37.130 --> 04:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
to support the farming industry and and
 
04:21:39.950 --> 04:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
may I have a follow-up follow-up but I'm
 
04:21:41.689 --> 04:21:41.699 align:start position:0%
still left with the confusion
 
04:21:43.849 --> 04:21:43.859 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's point if I
 
04:21:45.530 --> 04:21:45.540 align:start position:0%
understood it was
 
04:21:48.650 --> 04:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
uh it might be more effective to go
 
04:21:52.130 --> 04:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
directly to a Farm Stand and although
 
04:21:54.110 --> 04:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
that would be acceptable under the
 
04:21:56.450 --> 04:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
federal program Would we not have to add
 
04:21:59.090 --> 04:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
Farm stands into the language here for
 
04:22:00.849 --> 04:22:00.859 align:start position:0%
it to be
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
authorized for Farm Stand use in New
 
04:22:03.600 --> 04:22:10.670 align:start position:0%
authorized for Farm Stand use in New
Hampshire

04:22:10.670 --> 04:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:12.830 --> 04:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
there is availability under our
 
04:22:15.469 --> 04:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
regulations that allow some of those
 
04:22:18.290 --> 04:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
other opportunities and I I don't want
 
04:22:21.229 --> 04:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
to beat a dead horse but we're executing
 
04:22:25.610 --> 04:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
this bill tomorrow and if there is to if
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
there is need of an amendment we need to
 
04:22:32.330 --> 04:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
get an amendment so my concern is if
 
04:22:34.010 --> 04:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is include Farm
 
04:22:34.020 --> 04:22:37.330 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is include Farm
stands

04:22:37.330 --> 04:22:37.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:40.969 --> 04:22:40.979 align:start position:0%
this doesn't allow Farm Stand use
 
04:22:43.929 --> 04:22:43.939 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:22:46.610 --> 04:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative cofult
 
04:22:48.410 --> 04:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
can you can you speak a little bit to
 
04:22:51.050 --> 04:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
the vendor authorization requirements
 
04:22:53.269 --> 04:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
and process so my understanding is that
 
04:22:54.610 --> 04:22:54.620 align:start position:0%
in order to accept
 
04:22:58.610 --> 04:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
uh accept this as a form of payment that
 
04:23:01.070 --> 04:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
a Farm Stand if that is added to the
 
04:23:01.080 --> 04:23:01.849 align:start position:0%
a Farm Stand if that is added to the
bill

04:23:01.849 --> 04:23:01.859 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:23:05.030 --> 04:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
or an individual vendor at a farmer's
 
04:23:05.040 --> 04:23:06.110 align:start position:0%
or an individual vendor at a farmer's
market

04:23:06.110 --> 04:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
market
 
04:23:08.090 --> 04:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
would be required to go through an
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
application process potentially even
 
04:23:14.389 --> 04:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
have electronic equipment for accepting
 
04:23:16.189 --> 04:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
electronic payment I'm not sure if that
 
04:23:17.689 --> 04:23:17.699 align:start position:0%
would be required or not can you speak
 
04:23:19.610 --> 04:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
to that process please sure thank you
 
04:23:22.429 --> 04:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
for your question yes it is true farmers
 
04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
that would want to participate in the
 
04:23:26.330 --> 04:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
WIC Farmers Market program would have to
 
04:23:28.010 --> 04:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
be authorized and there is a little bit
 
04:23:30.590 --> 04:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
of a process a paper process and
 
04:23:32.689 --> 04:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
typically an on-site visit including
 
04:23:34.490 --> 04:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
civil rights training for example
 
04:23:37.969 --> 04:23:37.979 align:start position:0%
requirements by USDA
 
04:23:41.630 --> 04:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
um as far as I'm sorry I forget what the
 
04:23:43.969 --> 04:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
second part of your question was
 
04:23:46.670 --> 04:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh it pertained to any specialized
 
04:23:48.170 --> 04:23:48.180 align:start position:0%
equipment that might be required for
 
04:23:50.210 --> 04:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
accepting payment yes thank you for that
 
04:23:53.210 --> 04:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
so we have heard from other states that
 
04:23:54.590 --> 04:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
have already moved along in the
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
modernization process that farmers
 
04:23:58.309 --> 04:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily interested in having
 
04:24:00.229 --> 04:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
little electronic devices at their
 
04:24:01.849 --> 04:24:01.859 align:start position:0%
stands because most of them don't have
 
04:24:03.950 --> 04:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
access to Wi-Fi so there is more
 
04:24:05.929 --> 04:24:05.939 align:start position:0%
Innovative technology available such as
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
using smartphones for Farmers to be able
 
04:24:11.870 --> 04:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
to move to an electronic version and so
 
04:24:13.849 --> 04:24:13.859 align:start position:0%
that I guess that would be one of the
 
04:24:15.469 --> 04:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
decisions that the farmer would have to
 
04:24:18.590 --> 04:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
make for participation
 
04:24:22.250 --> 04:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Merchant
 
04:24:24.050 --> 04:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
following up thank you Mr chairman also
 
04:24:25.910 --> 04:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
following up on President Cole fault's
 
04:24:25.920 --> 04:24:26.750 align:start position:0%
following up on President Cole fault's
question

04:24:26.750 --> 04:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:24:29.450 --> 04:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
to minimize the process to the farm
 
04:24:31.910 --> 04:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
would be and so onerous potentially
 
04:24:34.070 --> 04:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
when I shop at the local supermarket
 
04:24:35.870 --> 04:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
there's times in which they actually
 
04:24:38.510 --> 04:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
have produce out there it says Source
 
04:24:40.550 --> 04:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
from a local farmer
 
04:24:42.950 --> 04:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
would it be possible that within the
 
04:24:45.530 --> 04:24:45.540 align:start position:0%
grocery store itself they're obtaining
 
04:24:47.570 --> 04:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
the produce through the grocery store
 
04:24:49.849 --> 04:24:49.859 align:start position:0%
from a local farmer to minimize the
 
04:24:51.769 --> 04:24:51.779 align:start position:0%
farmer's requirement to apply for an
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
application in the electronic
 
04:24:56.090 --> 04:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
would it be is that feasible under the
 
04:24:58.010 --> 04:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
federal law to say that if the grocery
 
04:24:59.809 --> 04:24:59.819 align:start position:0%
store can identify produce that's
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
actually raised locally and sold to the
 
04:25:02.279 --> 04:25:05.269 align:start position:0%
actually raised locally and sold to the
store

04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:07.490 --> 04:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
the Federal Regulations know that would
 
04:25:11.630 --> 04:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
not be an allowable activity
 
04:25:15.410 --> 04:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
see none
 
04:25:23.330 --> 04:25:23.340 align:start position:0%

more than 300 of our partners Statewide
 
04:26:04.969 --> 04:26:04.979 align:start position:0%
that are concerned and seek to improve
 
04:26:07.729 --> 04:26:07.739 align:start position:0%
access to nutritious local food for all
 
04:26:09.710 --> 04:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire I also come to
 
04:26:11.809 --> 04:26:11.819 align:start position:0%
you as a dietitian to provide you with
 
04:26:13.790 --> 04:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
evidence-based information about this
 
04:26:16.610 --> 04:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
program and its Effectiveness in
 
04:26:18.710 --> 04:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
improving Health as well as improving
 
04:26:20.990 --> 04:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
consumption and and purchase of fruits
 
04:26:22.849 --> 04:26:22.859 align:start position:0%
and vegetables I also come to you
 
04:26:24.769 --> 04:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
personally as a woman pregnant with her
 
04:26:27.229 --> 04:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
first child to talk to you about my own
 
04:26:29.689 --> 04:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
feelings about how important farmers
 
04:26:32.110 --> 04:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
markets will be in raising my own child
 
04:26:34.250 --> 04:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
so first I want to talk to you about the
 
04:26:36.530 --> 04:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
evidence for the program and so it is
 
04:26:38.570 --> 04:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
shown that anybody attending a farmer's
 
04:26:41.410 --> 04:26:41.420 align:start position:0%
market of course has
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
greater purchases of fresh fruits and
 
04:26:45.590 --> 04:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
vegetables so specifically in the
 
04:26:47.090 --> 04:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
populations of those that have low
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
income it actually is shown to increase
 
04:26:52.189 --> 04:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
by their fruit and vegetable intake and
 
04:26:54.469 --> 04:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
that's actual consumption by as many as
 
04:26:57.070 --> 04:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
eight servings of vegetables per week
 
04:26:59.330 --> 04:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
and two and a half servings of fruits
 
04:27:01.130 --> 04:27:01.140 align:start position:0%
per week so really effective in that
 
04:27:02.689 --> 04:27:02.699 align:start position:0%
sense and that's been shown in studies
 
04:27:05.510 --> 04:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
across the United States it increases
 
04:27:07.969 --> 04:27:07.979 align:start position:0%
specifically consumption of produce for
 
04:27:09.910 --> 04:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
young children as well
 
04:27:13.309 --> 04:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
that increased consumption as well it
 
04:27:15.229 --> 04:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
continues two to six months after the
 
04:27:17.689 --> 04:27:17.699 align:start position:0%
participation ends in that particular
 
04:27:20.269 --> 04:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
program so it's it's there's that
 
04:27:23.510 --> 04:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
suggests that this is a long-standing
 
04:27:26.689 --> 04:27:26.699 align:start position:0%
change in behaviors that can actually
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
take place and change their actual
 
04:27:33.170 --> 04:27:33.180 align:start position:0%
their actual desire for these Foods as
 
04:27:33.180 --> 04:27:33.889 align:start position:0%
their actual desire for these Foods as
well

04:27:33.889 --> 04:27:33.899 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:27:36.170 --> 04:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
as a dietitian I know that it's really
 
04:27:38.030 --> 04:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
important to expose our young children
 
04:27:39.710 --> 04:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
to fresh fruits and vegetables at a
 
04:27:40.670 --> 04:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
young age
 
04:27:42.769 --> 04:27:42.779 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we establish good
 
04:27:45.290 --> 04:27:45.300 align:start position:0%
relationships with fresh produce and
 
04:27:47.809 --> 04:27:47.819 align:start position:0%
develop that desire and that taste for
 
04:27:50.030 --> 04:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
fresh fruits and vegetables good habits
 
04:27:51.830 --> 04:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
over a lifetime will reduce health care
 
04:27:54.590 --> 04:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
costs and as well as good build good
 
04:27:56.210 --> 04:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
purchasing habits and building Community
 
04:27:58.670 --> 04:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
as well and being in community
 
04:28:00.830 --> 04:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
as an expectant mother myself I look
 
04:28:02.689 --> 04:28:02.699 align:start position:0%
forward to attending farmers markets if
 
04:28:04.250 --> 04:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
anybody's ever been they're really
 
04:28:06.170 --> 04:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
Lively they're really fun a lot of times
 
04:28:08.149 --> 04:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
they have live music and other things to
 
04:28:10.429 --> 04:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
look at people to speak to and it really
 
04:28:12.590 --> 04:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
brings you into communities so this is
 
04:28:14.450 --> 04:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for our children to
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
watch us in our communities having these
 
04:28:19.490 --> 04:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
conversations with Farmers as well as
 
04:28:21.889 --> 04:28:21.899 align:start position:0%
programs like these I believe will also
 
04:28:23.570 --> 04:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
help people that believe that they can't
 
04:28:25.729 --> 04:28:25.739 align:start position:0%
afford or are welcome in these
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
communities to be able to come to these
 
04:28:29.389 --> 04:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
communities and so there's lots of
 
04:28:31.610 --> 04:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
opportunities for learning for young
 
04:28:34.189 --> 04:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
children to be able to both consume
 
04:28:35.450 --> 04:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
fresh fruits and vegetables see where
 
04:28:36.769 --> 04:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
they're grown see where they're produced
 
04:28:38.510 --> 04:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
and not just think strawberries only
 
04:28:40.370 --> 04:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
come from the supermarket and don't
 
04:28:42.170 --> 04:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
actually grow out of the ground so
 
04:28:44.269 --> 04:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
really really important additional
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
benefits it limits the way we spend
 
04:28:49.910 --> 04:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
funds that are only on local produce and
 
04:28:52.189 --> 04:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
go directly to Farmers and now is the
 
04:28:54.050 --> 04:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
right time I'm speaking on behalf of
 
04:28:57.110 --> 04:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
over 300 Partners across the state and
 
04:28:59.330 --> 04:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
they are all behind us and they they
 
04:29:01.550 --> 04:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
build local coalitions to be able to
 
04:29:03.590 --> 04:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
support these programs and help get
 
04:29:06.110 --> 04:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
information out about them as well so
 
04:29:07.790 --> 04:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is a triple win both for the
 
04:29:10.010 --> 04:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
economy for our people in New Hampshire
 
04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
to improve health and as well as our
 
04:29:14.269 --> 04:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
farmers and I'm happy to take any
 
04:29:16.309 --> 04:29:16.319 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
04:29:16.319 --> 04:29:19.910 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
questions

04:29:19.910 --> 04:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:21.769 --> 04:29:21.779 align:start position:0%
I see no questions
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
oh yes go ahead thank you chairman and
 
04:29:26.750 --> 04:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question do we
 
04:29:31.370 --> 04:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
know if farmers are interested in this
 
04:29:33.530 --> 04:29:33.540 align:start position:0%
um Bill passing
 
04:29:36.410 --> 04:29:36.420 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you for the question I do
 
04:29:38.389 --> 04:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
know that we looked at this legislation
 
04:29:40.309 --> 04:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
last year and we did have testimony last
 
04:29:42.110 --> 04:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
year um the turnaround on this was a
 
04:29:43.070 --> 04:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
little quick and we weren't able to
 
04:29:45.410 --> 04:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
bring any Farmers I have her testimony
 
04:29:47.809 --> 04:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
from farmers in the past that
 
04:29:49.729 --> 04:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
participated in this program and saw it
 
04:29:52.309 --> 04:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
as a huge detriment to lose it when it
 
04:29:56.689 --> 04:29:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:59.990 --> 04:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
see no other questions so thank you very
 
04:30:06.769 --> 04:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:09.170 --> 04:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify is Eileen
 
04:30:20.570 --> 04:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:22.729 --> 04:30:22.739 align:start position:0%
you have three minutes ma'am
 
04:30:24.110 --> 04:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:25.910 --> 04:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
on the testimony of passing out is from
 
04:30:27.229 --> 04:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
a colleague of mine who can't attend
 
04:30:29.090 --> 04:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
because she's down in the education
 
04:30:31.610 --> 04:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
committee hopefully the farm to school
 
04:30:33.530 --> 04:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
bill is passing so we have more fresh
 
04:30:35.149 --> 04:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
fruits and vegetables exposure to our
 
04:30:36.530 --> 04:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
children and that's the main reason why
 
04:30:38.750 --> 04:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here this is multifaceted in our
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
approach the New Hampshire food bank has
 
04:30:43.550 --> 04:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
to increasing the exposure to New
 
04:30:45.170 --> 04:30:45.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fresh fruits and vegetables to
 
04:30:47.210 --> 04:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
our population
 
04:30:49.729 --> 04:30:49.739 align:start position:0%
children learn what they live and when
 
04:30:50.929 --> 04:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
they learn at a young age the
 
04:30:52.429 --> 04:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
appreciation for fruits and vegetables
 
04:30:53.929 --> 04:30:53.939 align:start position:0%
that's going to carry them throughout
 
04:30:56.090 --> 04:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
their life and we know if they start
 
04:30:57.649 --> 04:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
young they're going to lead a healthier
 
04:30:57.659 --> 04:30:58.910 align:start position:0%
young they're going to lead a healthier
life

04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
life
 
04:31:01.309 --> 04:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
so our approach is multifaceted like I
 
04:31:03.290 --> 04:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
said and this is one of them we also
 
04:31:05.929 --> 04:31:05.939 align:start position:0%
operate Granite State Market match and
 
04:31:08.090 --> 04:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
double up food bucks those are two snap
 
04:31:11.630 --> 04:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
incentives so this is also a way I think
 
04:31:14.630 --> 04:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
if a WIC participant is also a new snap
 
04:31:16.010 --> 04:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
participant they could find out about
 
04:31:18.410 --> 04:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
these incentives as well so there's more
 
04:31:20.210 --> 04:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
incentives to bring them to the farmers
 
04:31:22.010 --> 04:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
markets if they're also a snap recipient
 
04:31:24.110 --> 04:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
which likely is happening if they're a
 
04:31:25.429 --> 04:31:25.439 align:start position:0%
WIC recipient
 
04:31:27.889 --> 04:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
so double up food box that operates in
 
04:31:29.090 --> 04:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
the grocery stores to answer your
 
04:31:30.590 --> 04:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
previous question it does not require
 
04:31:33.110 --> 04:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
that the produce is local but they can
 
04:31:36.170 --> 04:31:36.180 align:start position:0%
get double their snap value for produce
 
04:31:38.809 --> 04:31:38.819 align:start position:0%
purchased in the retail environment
 
04:31:40.610 --> 04:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
using Grant State Market match I mean
 
04:31:41.990 --> 04:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
sorry double up food bucks
 
04:31:43.790 --> 04:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
Grant State Market match operates the
 
04:31:45.229 --> 04:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
same way but in the farmers markets and
 
04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
at the farmer's stands so they are
 
04:31:48.410 --> 04:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
equipped at the farm stands because of
 
04:31:50.269 --> 04:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
these two incentive programs so it
 
04:31:52.309 --> 04:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
should be relatively easy for them the
 
04:31:54.170 --> 04:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
farmers to participate in this WIC
 
04:31:59.269 --> 04:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
it's really about children learn what
 
04:32:04.130 --> 04:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
they live I'll just tell you a quick
 
04:32:05.570 --> 04:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
story when the New Hampshire National
 
04:32:06.950 --> 04:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
Guard was with us at the food bank
 
04:32:08.809 --> 04:32:08.819 align:start position:0%
during covid
 
04:32:11.929 --> 04:32:11.939 align:start position:0%
I had an opportunity later years later
 
04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
to run into Lieutenant Colonel Gagnon
 
04:32:15.710 --> 04:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
and he stopped me and he said
 
04:32:17.330 --> 04:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
you taught me something and I'm never
 
04:32:19.130 --> 04:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
going to forget it and I asked him what
 
04:32:21.830 --> 04:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
it was and he said I was expressing my
 
04:32:23.149 --> 04:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
frustration to you
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
about people in the fast food line at
 
04:32:27.769 --> 04:32:27.779 align:start position:0%
McDonald's loading up their grocery
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
carts with frozen pizzas why aren't they
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
giving their kids the food that they
 
04:32:31.920 --> 04:32:32.929 align:start position:0%
giving their kids the food that they
need

04:32:32.929 --> 04:32:32.939 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:32:35.149 --> 04:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
and I said what if that's all they know
 
04:32:37.130 --> 04:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
what if they grew up like that and they
 
04:32:39.229 --> 04:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
didn't have that exposure they don't
 
04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
know this is what you're giving them
 
04:32:43.490 --> 04:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
that exposure for a healthy lifetime
 
04:32:46.250 --> 04:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
so that this becomes a part of their
 
04:32:48.229 --> 04:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
expectation in their diet
 
04:32:51.110 --> 04:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
I deserve and I expect fresh fruits and
 
04:32:51.120 --> 04:32:52.309 align:start position:0%
I deserve and I expect fresh fruits and
vegetables

04:32:52.309 --> 04:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
vegetables
 
04:32:53.630 --> 04:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to do and this
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
is just one small part of it that we
 
04:32:57.410 --> 04:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
hope you can support and any federal
 
04:32:59.809 --> 04:32:59.819 align:start position:0%
program that helps feed our New
 
04:33:02.570 --> 04:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire food insecure we have 180 000
 
04:33:04.670 --> 04:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
kids enrolled in school
 
04:33:07.490 --> 04:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
12 of them are food insecure so that's
 
04:33:10.970 --> 04:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
21 600 kids
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
we need to get to them as much as
 
04:33:14.090 --> 04:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
possible and we're doing the best we can
 
04:33:15.769 --> 04:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
and we hope you support us as well thank
 
04:33:17.390 --> 04:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
04:33:17.400 --> 04:33:19.070 align:start position:0%
you thank you
questions

04:33:19.070 --> 04:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:33:22.131 --> 04:33:22.141 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber
 
04:33:23.810 --> 04:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
I'm still trying to clarify about the
 
04:33:29.949 --> 04:33:29.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:33.769 --> 04:33:33.779 align:start position:0%
are available at farmers markets
 
04:33:35.390 --> 04:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
Granite State Market match is available
 
04:33:37.730 --> 04:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
at farmers markets double up food box is
 
04:33:39.230 --> 04:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
available in the retail grocery stores
 
04:33:42.349 --> 04:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
that participate okay so and so none of
 
04:33:44.810 --> 04:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
those neither of those are direct Farm
 
04:33:47.209 --> 04:33:47.219 align:start position:0%
Stand their Farmers Market programs
 
04:33:49.189 --> 04:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
they're also redeemable at Farm stance
 
04:33:51.949 --> 04:33:51.959 align:start position:0%
okay and are there participating Farm
 
04:33:55.910 --> 04:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
stands oh yeah okay that is exactly what
 
04:33:58.070 --> 04:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
I needed to know thank you
 
04:34:00.650 --> 04:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
okay other questions yes
 
04:34:02.810 --> 04:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm not sure if this
 
04:34:04.429 --> 04:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
is a question for you or someone someone
 
04:34:07.189 --> 04:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
else but um what happens to the money if
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine it's not going to be
 
04:34:16.730 --> 04:34:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:17.929 --> 04:34:17.939 align:start position:0%
I think it would go back to the general
 
04:34:20.209 --> 04:34:20.219 align:start position:0%
funds but that's I'm not the
 
04:34:24.349 --> 04:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:26.689 --> 04:34:26.699 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
04:34:26.699 --> 04:34:28.010 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
cofult

04:34:28.010 --> 04:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
cofult
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so you you said that there are
 
04:34:33.230 --> 04:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
um already vendors participating in that
 
04:34:36.170 --> 04:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
program so am I to understand that they
 
04:34:38.330 --> 04:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
they would not need to re-qualify that
 
04:34:39.890 --> 04:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
they would essentially automatically
 
04:34:43.551 --> 04:34:43.561 align:start position:0%
already be able to serve as vendors I
 
04:34:46.131 --> 04:34:46.141 align:start position:0%
can't say that only if the um
 
04:34:48.590 --> 04:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh whoever they are set up with with
 
04:34:50.029 --> 04:34:50.039 align:start position:0%
double up food bucks and Garden State
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
Market match made that you know kind of
 
04:34:52.849 --> 04:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
like if you're on Medicaid you can
 
04:34:54.109 --> 04:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
automatically get three and reduce lunch
 
04:34:56.570 --> 04:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
we hope that passes as well
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
but you know the same type of thing if
 
04:35:00.109 --> 04:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
that could be made very easy by the
 
04:35:02.269 --> 04:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
department but that's not something that
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
we do
 
04:35:05.830 --> 04:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:35:08.631 --> 04:35:08.641 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
04:35:09.890 --> 04:35:09.900 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:35:09.900 --> 04:35:10.849 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

04:35:10.849 --> 04:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:35:10.859 --> 04:35:11.990 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:13.789 --> 04:35:13.799 align:start position:0%
I have a question about the dollar
 
04:35:13.799 --> 04:35:14.869 align:start position:0%
I have a question about the dollar
amount

04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
amount
 
04:35:19.849 --> 04:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
um the 30 that's per season correct is
 
04:35:21.650 --> 04:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
that more I mean I'm thinking for the
 
04:35:23.750 --> 04:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
consumer point of view is that more of a
 
04:35:25.730 --> 04:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
symbolic dollar amount or will it have a
 
04:35:27.590 --> 04:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
real nutritional change for that I think
 
04:35:28.849 --> 04:35:28.859 align:start position:0%
it will have a real nutritional change I
 
04:35:30.650 --> 04:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
think historically it was much lower and
 
04:35:33.410 --> 04:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
you know 30 is a pretty good amount and
 
04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's what I pay for my produce boxes
 
04:35:37.070 --> 04:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
that I have coming out of a regional
 
04:35:39.949 --> 04:35:39.959 align:start position:0%
Cooperative so I would imagine that they
 
04:35:42.410 --> 04:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
would get probably given the percentages
 
04:35:42.420 --> 04:35:44.209 align:start position:0%
would get probably given the percentages
probably

04:35:44.209 --> 04:35:44.219 align:start position:0%
probably
 
04:35:49.131 --> 04:35:49.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:52.730 --> 04:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Merchant
 
04:35:54.769 --> 04:35:54.779 align:start position:0%
in the purpose thank you Mr chairman
 
04:35:56.689 --> 04:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
also taking the question in the program
 
04:35:58.310 --> 04:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
04:36:00.830 --> 04:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
is there like in a farmer's market to
 
04:36:03.109 --> 04:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
minimize the administrative burden to
 
04:36:04.250 --> 04:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
the farmers
 
04:36:08.570 --> 04:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
and also the technology can they work
 
04:36:10.250 --> 04:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
together collectively so you have a
 
04:36:11.590 --> 04:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
central place to pay for everything
 
04:36:14.090 --> 04:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
versus every single farmer having to
 
04:36:16.189 --> 04:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
have a license maybe it's not your
 
04:36:17.330 --> 04:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
question maybe it goes back to the
 
04:36:19.849 --> 04:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
department because if you got
 
04:36:22.670 --> 04:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
10 or 12 farmers there that are selling
 
04:36:25.869 --> 04:36:25.879 align:start position:0%
their produce and fruits and so forth
 
04:36:27.830 --> 04:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
administratively having one central
 
04:36:29.631 --> 04:36:29.641 align:start position:0%
place to pay things
 
04:36:32.150 --> 04:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
would be a lot simpler for the person
 
04:36:34.010 --> 04:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
paying it plus also for those who are
 
04:36:35.689 --> 04:36:35.699 align:start position:0%
there I'm just trying to find a way to
 
04:36:37.070 --> 04:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
minimize it in your program can you have
 
04:36:38.570 --> 04:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
one application covering multiple
 
04:36:40.490 --> 04:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
Farmers that they have to have their own
 
04:36:42.529 --> 04:36:42.539 align:start position:0%
application their own software
 
04:36:44.390 --> 04:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
but that's not a program that we run so
 
04:36:47.449 --> 04:36:47.459 align:start position:0%
I can't answer that question
 
04:36:49.990 --> 04:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
um there are Farm hubs that do that
 
04:36:53.570 --> 04:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
collectively could a participant go to a
 
04:36:55.250 --> 04:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
farm Hub and
 
04:36:57.470 --> 04:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's that's a good question
 
04:36:58.310 --> 04:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
um there might be somebody in the
 
04:36:59.869 --> 04:36:59.879 align:start position:0%
audience that can answer that
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
but there there isn't a way
 
04:37:03.170 --> 04:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
um and that would create
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
administratively you get a figure
 
04:37:06.051 --> 04:37:06.061 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to be taking all these
 
04:37:07.789 --> 04:37:07.799 align:start position:0%
transactions in and then paying them all
 
04:37:09.709 --> 04:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
back out as opposed to the farmer just
 
04:37:11.689 --> 04:37:11.699 align:start position:0%
getting it done right then and there
 
04:37:13.131 --> 04:37:13.141 align:start position:0%
um I think administratively it might
 
04:37:16.609 --> 04:37:16.619 align:start position:0%
cost a lot more than it alleviates
 
04:37:19.310 --> 04:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative
 
04:37:21.109 --> 04:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:37:23.810 --> 04:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I was taking notes
 
04:37:25.789 --> 04:37:25.799 align:start position:0%
and I'm a little confused can you please
 
04:37:28.609 --> 04:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
uh reiterate what the Granite State
 
04:37:31.250 --> 04:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
Market match at Farm stands program is
 
04:37:32.929 --> 04:37:32.939 align:start position:0%
and does and how it operates and how
 
04:37:35.269 --> 04:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
that dovetails with what's on the
 
04:37:37.369 --> 04:37:37.379 align:start position:0%
proposed bill so if you are a snap
 
04:37:39.230 --> 04:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
recipient and you have twenty dollars
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
worth of snap
 
04:37:43.789 --> 04:37:43.799 align:start position:0%
redeemable food food stamps
 
04:37:45.709 --> 04:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
that money is matched in the farmer's
 
04:37:47.090 --> 04:37:47.100 align:start position:0%
market so you can go to the farmer's
 
04:37:48.830 --> 04:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
market and get another twenty dollars
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
and that can be spent there at the
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:54.590 --> 04:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
same thing with double up food bucks but
 
04:37:56.449 --> 04:37:56.459 align:start position:0%
in the retail environment for those that
 
04:37:56.459 --> 04:37:59.090 align:start position:0%
in the retail environment for those that
participate

04:37:59.090 --> 04:37:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
so doubles your buying power if you're
 
04:38:03.590 --> 04:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
going to buy fruits and vegetables
 
04:38:07.609 --> 04:38:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:09.470 --> 04:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
I apologies how is that different from
 
04:38:11.810 --> 04:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
what's proposed is it just that that's
 
04:38:14.449 --> 04:38:14.459 align:start position:0%
WIC specifically or is there right this
 
04:38:15.830 --> 04:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
would be Wick specific and the other one
 
04:38:18.529 --> 04:38:18.539 align:start position:0%
is snap specific
 
04:38:20.750 --> 04:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
other questions did you have your hand
 
04:38:22.970 --> 04:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
up earlier okay I'm sorry other
 
04:38:22.980 --> 04:38:25.250 align:start position:0%
up earlier okay I'm sorry other

questions
 
04:38:26.810 --> 04:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's it thank you very
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.590 --> 04:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
and the last person signed up to testify
 
04:38:37.250 --> 04:38:37.260 align:start position:0%

okay

04:38:50.330 --> 04:38:50.340 align:start position:0%

04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
and we did receive her written testimony
 
04:38:54.410 --> 04:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
that was just passed around so we
 
04:38:57.949 --> 04:38:57.959 align:start position:0%
appreciate that anyone else uh wishes to
 
04:39:00.769 --> 04:39:00.779 align:start position:0%
testify I have no one else signed up

thank you for taking my question
 
04:39:17.150 --> 04:39:17.160 align:start position:0%

markets in the end of line seven and the
 
04:39:26.890 --> 04:39:26.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:31.070 --> 04:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
my proposal representative was to on the

on this bill and move on
 
04:40:52.490 --> 04:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
to HB 565. I am going to open the public
 
04:40:55.448 --> 04:40:55.458 align:start position:0%
hearing on HP 565
 
04:40:57.948 --> 04:40:57.958 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
04:41:11.750 --> 04:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
honor roll colleagues for the record my
 
04:41:13.970 --> 04:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
name is Megan Murray I represent the
 
04:41:16.730 --> 04:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
towns of Amherst and Milford I come to
 
04:41:19.190 --> 04:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
today speaking about postpartum Medicaid
 
04:41:19.200 --> 04:41:20.390 align:start position:0%
today speaking about postpartum Medicaid
expansion

04:41:20.390 --> 04:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
04:41:24.170 --> 04:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
HB 565 before you simply asks for an
 
04:41:26.208 --> 04:41:26.218 align:start position:0%
extension one going from 60 days where
 
04:41:28.190 --> 04:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
we already that we already provide
 
04:41:30.890 --> 04:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
coverage under Medicaid supplemental
 
04:41:33.350 --> 04:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
support to a full 12 months in benefits
 
04:41:35.090 --> 04:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
post-pregnancy to those most vulnerable
 
04:41:36.830 --> 04:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
and income and Circumstance
 
04:41:38.930 --> 04:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
I'll cut to the chase funding has been
 
04:41:40.490 --> 04:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
available and is already allocated at
 
04:41:42.170 --> 04:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
the federal level all we have to do here
 
04:41:43.970 --> 04:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is act
 
04:41:46.010 --> 04:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
the bill is an effort to address what we
 
04:41:48.288 --> 04:41:48.298 align:start position:0%
know and spoke to in data last term
 
04:41:50.510 --> 04:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
regarding postpartum Medicaid expansion
 
04:41:53.030 --> 04:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh whereby a small yet very important
 
04:41:56.330 --> 04:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
population of those post-pregnancy are
 
04:41:58.128 --> 04:41:58.138 align:start position:0%
left with a gap in coverage and frankly
 
04:41:59.448 --> 04:41:59.458 align:start position:0%
access to care
 
04:42:02.570 --> 04:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
I'm simply asking that we move the
 
04:42:04.250 --> 04:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
coverage from 60 days to one year to
 
04:42:05.810 --> 04:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
ensure that our Granite State moms and
 
04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
babies have the best chance that they
 
04:42:09.288 --> 04:42:09.298 align:start position:0%
can at an early at early intervention
 
04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
and success it benefits us all
 
04:42:13.970 --> 04:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
though I was lucky enough to have
 
04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
insurance myself in all three of my
 
04:42:17.690 --> 04:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
pregnancies and did not utilize Medicaid
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
I think about how many inequities exist
 
04:42:21.410 --> 04:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
due lack of reimbursement or coverage
 
04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
for those seeking and needing support
 
04:42:24.948 --> 04:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
post-pregnant Tennessee throughout the
 
04:42:27.590 --> 04:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
granite state I personally had a spinal
 
04:42:30.350 --> 04:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
fluid leak in an epidural gonori that
 
04:42:31.730 --> 04:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
resulted in months and months of
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
physical therapy and care my posture
 
04:42:36.650 --> 04:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
today is a reminder of what went wrong
 
04:42:38.750 --> 04:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
I was treated ultimately for postpartum
 
04:42:40.910 --> 04:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
anxiety though I never knew it existed
 
04:42:44.050 --> 04:42:44.060 align:start position:0%
more on that later
 
04:42:46.910 --> 04:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
and so I didn't know what I was looking
 
04:42:46.920 --> 04:42:48.410 align:start position:0%
and so I didn't know what I was looking
for

04:42:48.410 --> 04:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
um when I was at the doctors they would
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
often ask about the baby blues they
 
04:42:54.770 --> 04:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
would often ask if I was sad or had all
 
04:42:56.628 --> 04:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
of those sorts of feelings around that
 
04:42:58.190 --> 04:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:43:00.530 --> 04:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
what I was never asked was about anxiety
 
04:43:02.448 --> 04:43:02.458 align:start position:0%
due to what I experienced in
 
04:43:04.250 --> 04:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
complications with the spinal fluid leak
 
04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
a blood two blood patches to repair the
 
04:43:08.990 --> 04:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
leak and a cellulitis infection
 
04:43:09.000 --> 04:43:10.310 align:start position:0%
leak and a cellulitis infection
afterwards

04:43:10.310 --> 04:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
04:43:13.430 --> 04:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
now imagine that that same circumstance
 
04:43:16.070 --> 04:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
where a mom uh and that was nine months
 
04:43:17.810 --> 04:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
post-pregnancy that that was identified
 
04:43:20.270 --> 04:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
now imagine that same circumstance where
 
04:43:22.430 --> 04:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
new mom's 60-day postpartum Medicaid
 
04:43:25.070 --> 04:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
coverage has run out what then where do
 
04:43:27.230 --> 04:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
they turn or do they like every parent
 
04:43:29.510 --> 04:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
trajon the best they can regardless of
 
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
their unmet needs there can be a myriad
 
04:43:33.410 --> 04:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
of health issues experienced in the
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
weeks days and months after giving birth
 
04:43:36.650 --> 04:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
whether it's needing a little bit of
 
04:43:38.330 --> 04:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
extra support with lactation or support
 
04:43:40.610 --> 04:43:40.620 align:start position:0%
and recovering from complications or any
 
04:43:43.670 --> 04:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
other Rel need related to post-pregnancy
 
04:43:45.288 --> 04:43:45.298 align:start position:0%
like mental health care
 
04:43:48.110 --> 04:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
there are um
 
04:43:51.050 --> 04:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
there are Inc income aside the issues
 
04:43:53.030 --> 04:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
themselves don't discriminate and the
 
04:43:55.070 --> 04:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
ability to access care
 
04:43:55.080 --> 04:43:55.910 align:start position:0%
ability to access care
um

04:43:55.910 --> 04:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:58.190 --> 04:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
and the ability to access care is the
 
04:44:00.590 --> 04:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
burden and early intervention lowers the
 
04:44:02.330 --> 04:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
overall cost of care
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
studies show that investing early in
 
04:44:05.930 --> 04:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
healthy mothers and babies yields
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
healthier communities and families I
 
04:44:09.470 --> 04:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
think about roughly the Thousand
 
04:44:11.030 --> 04:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
pregnancies in children whose lives
 
04:44:12.770 --> 04:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
would be positively impacted should they
 
04:44:15.288 --> 04:44:15.298 align:start position:0%
be able to receive an extended uh
 
04:44:19.070 --> 04:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
term of care for a full interrupted one
 
04:44:20.570 --> 04:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
year here in New Hampshire and know that
 
04:44:22.610 --> 04:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
it's crucial to our success and theirs
 
04:44:24.350 --> 04:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll happily take any
 
04:44:24.360 --> 04:44:28.310 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll happily take any
questions

04:44:28.310 --> 04:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:31.250 --> 04:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
got me in the middle of a of a sip here
 
04:44:32.690 --> 04:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:44:36.170 --> 04:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative Shapiro
 
04:44:38.750 --> 04:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:44:40.910 --> 04:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative and sorry if I missed
 
04:44:43.070 --> 04:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
this and you already said it but
 
04:44:45.410 --> 04:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
um how many states have taken this
 
04:44:45.420 --> 04:44:47.030 align:start position:0%
um how many states have taken this
option

04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
option
 
04:44:48.830 --> 04:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I think somebody
 
04:44:50.510 --> 04:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
in the department who's probably
 
04:44:52.368 --> 04:44:52.378 align:start position:0%
watching this at a closer level may have
 
04:44:54.050 --> 04:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
a great snapshot of what other states
 
04:44:55.970 --> 04:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
but I do know that it's moving forward
 
04:44:57.830 --> 04:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
in many states across the country thank
 
04:44:57.840 --> 04:44:59.390 align:start position:0%
in many states across the country thank
you

04:44:59.390 --> 04:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:45:01.550 --> 04:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
04:45:01.560 --> 04:45:04.850 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
Merchant

04:45:04.850 --> 04:45:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:06.590 --> 04:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman also thank you for
 
04:45:08.090 --> 04:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
04:45:09.890 --> 04:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
this is all predicated upon them still
 
04:45:11.628 --> 04:45:11.638 align:start position:0%
being eligible for Medicaid so what
 
04:45:15.830 --> 04:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:17.330 --> 04:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
you know the 12 months you're talking
 
04:45:19.788 --> 04:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
about correct the 60 days it's all
 
04:45:21.170 --> 04:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
predicated upon a status correctly
 
04:45:23.628 --> 04:45:23.638 align:start position:0%
through medical assistance only if they
 
04:45:25.128 --> 04:45:25.138 align:start position:0%
qualify for the medical assistance in
 
04:45:27.350 --> 04:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
the first place so after three months or
 
04:45:28.550 --> 04:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
four months that they no longer
 
04:45:30.530 --> 04:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
qualified does that terminate this
 
04:45:30.540 --> 04:45:31.670 align:start position:0%
qualified does that terminate this
coverage

04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
04:45:34.010 --> 04:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
I believe that it is an extension of the
 
04:45:35.868 --> 04:45:35.878 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so if they I and I'll let
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
somebody okay behind there speak more
 
04:45:37.680 --> 04:45:38.628 align:start position:0%
somebody okay behind there speak more
more

04:45:38.628 --> 04:45:38.638 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:45:38.638 --> 04:45:40.810 align:start position:0%
more
um

04:45:40.810 --> 04:45:40.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:45.110 --> 04:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:49.250 --> 04:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:51.288 --> 04:45:51.298 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing no other questions so okay
 
04:45:55.970 --> 04:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:58.128 --> 04:45:58.138 align:start position:0%
next signed up to testify is Henry
 
04:46:00.170 --> 04:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
lippman and Rebecca Ross from the New
 
04:46:01.250 --> 04:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
 
04:46:01.260 --> 04:46:10.250 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Health and Human
Services

04:46:10.250 --> 04:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:12.470 --> 04:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
attending yourself to respond to the
 
04:46:26.230 --> 04:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:29.030 --> 04:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:46:30.410 --> 04:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Henry Littman
 
04:46:32.750 --> 04:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
the state's Medicaid director the
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
departments in support of this
 
04:46:34.440 --> 04:46:36.770 align:start position:0%
departments in support of this
legislation

04:46:36.770 --> 04:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:46:38.510 --> 04:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
um some of you who are on this committee
 
04:46:41.330 --> 04:46:41.340 align:start position:0%
last year may remember that you took
 
04:46:42.590 --> 04:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
this up as well
 
04:46:44.990 --> 04:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
I would like to uh I understand this
 
04:46:47.270 --> 04:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
bill may also be being exec tomorrow is
 
04:46:48.410 --> 04:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
04:46:50.330 --> 04:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it is
 
04:46:52.970 --> 04:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
they're all noticed but it doesn't mean
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
that we need to have a final disposition
 
04:46:56.448 --> 04:46:56.458 align:start position:0%
on any of them tomorrow they can be
 
04:46:56.458 --> 04:46:58.070 align:start position:0%
on any of them tomorrow they can be
recessed

04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
recessed
 
04:46:59.868 --> 04:46:59.878 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:47:02.930 --> 04:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
um Consolidated Appropriations act at
 
04:47:05.750 --> 04:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
the end of uh this past year that was
 
04:47:08.150 --> 04:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
passed by Congress which also covered
 
04:47:10.930 --> 04:47:10.940 align:start position:0%
the issue of the end of continuous
 
04:47:15.470 --> 04:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment under Medicaid also made
 
04:47:18.110 --> 04:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
permanent you may remember last session
 
04:47:20.810 --> 04:47:20.820 align:start position:0%
possibly you didn't if you weren't
 
04:47:22.490 --> 04:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
involved in it there was a five-year
 
04:47:25.970 --> 04:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
window in which this extra fmap Federal
 
04:47:28.610 --> 04:47:28.620 align:start position:0%
match was available this now makes it
 
04:47:31.430 --> 04:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
permanent so I think just in the in the
 
04:47:34.970 --> 04:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
bill updating the the citation to the
 
04:47:38.170 --> 04:47:38.180 align:start position:0%
the current law on that would make sense
 
04:47:40.970 --> 04:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
and I think that if if you need it for
 
04:47:42.350 --> 04:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
tomorrow that could be easily
 
04:47:45.230 --> 04:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
accommodated and then the second thing
 
04:47:47.770 --> 04:47:47.780 align:start position:0%
is you may recall last session
 
04:47:52.128 --> 04:47:52.138 align:start position:0%
the legislature enacted at 25 percent
 
04:47:54.850 --> 04:47:54.860 align:start position:0%
increase in the rates for
 
04:47:57.230 --> 04:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
hospitals delivering babies as well as
 
04:47:57.240 --> 04:47:58.010 align:start position:0%
hospitals delivering babies as well as
one

04:47:58.010 --> 04:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:48:00.948 --> 04:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
for our birthing centers so the
 
04:48:02.990 --> 04:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
department I think in an updated fiscal
 
04:48:05.270 --> 04:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
note would have instead of 200 000 would
 
04:48:08.330 --> 04:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
have 300 000 to reflect that there was
 
04:48:10.670 --> 04:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
that rate increase that occurred for
 
04:48:13.610 --> 04:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
delivering babies subsequent to last
 
04:48:15.050 --> 04:48:15.060 align:start position:0%
year's legislation
 
04:48:18.250 --> 04:48:18.260 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions and
 
04:48:21.708 --> 04:48:21.718 align:start position:0%
my colleague Rebecca Ross here can talk
 
04:48:23.330 --> 04:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
about maybe the clinical aspects for
 
04:48:25.368 --> 04:48:25.378 align:start position:0%
children and their moms Ms Ross would
 
04:48:27.350 --> 04:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
you like to speak and then we can direct
 
04:48:29.448 --> 04:48:29.458 align:start position:0%
questions to either one of you or
 
04:48:32.868 --> 04:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair and members of
 
04:48:34.310 --> 04:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
04:48:36.110 --> 04:48:36.120 align:start position:0%
Rebecca Ross I'm the director of The
 
04:48:37.930 --> 04:48:37.940 align:start position:0%
Bureau for children's Behavioral Health
 
04:48:41.208 --> 04:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
we too are here in support as well as
 
04:48:43.990 --> 04:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
the entire division of Behavioral Health
 
04:48:48.110 --> 04:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
with regard to this bill it would be
 
04:48:48.120 --> 04:48:49.310 align:start position:0%
with regard to this bill it would be
um

04:48:49.310 --> 04:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:51.110 --> 04:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
critical to supporting the work that
 
04:48:53.510 --> 04:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're doing with Early Childhood mental
 
04:48:55.550 --> 04:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
health which we know focuses on the
 
04:48:58.490 --> 04:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
parent and caregiver in order to ensure
 
04:49:01.670 --> 04:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
the physical and mental health of that
 
04:49:04.128 --> 04:49:04.138 align:start position:0%
parent or caregiver during the first
 
04:49:06.948 --> 04:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
year to reduce exposure to Aces and
 
04:49:06.958 --> 04:49:08.050 align:start position:0%
year to reduce exposure to Aces and
Trauma

04:49:08.050 --> 04:49:08.060 align:start position:0%
Trauma
 
04:49:11.208 --> 04:49:11.218 align:start position:0%
and avoid a lot of what we're seeing
 
04:49:12.890 --> 04:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
later in life so through the system of
 
04:49:15.350 --> 04:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
care work we've increased the Early
 
04:49:17.510 --> 04:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
Childhood infant mental health
 
04:49:19.070 --> 04:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
programming and enhanced care
 
04:49:22.070 --> 04:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
coordination and much of that work is
 
04:49:25.128 --> 04:49:25.138 align:start position:0%
reliant on that parent or caregiver also
 
04:49:26.930 --> 04:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
receiving the support and care that they
 
04:49:29.090 --> 04:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
need during that critical time so we
 
04:49:31.310 --> 04:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
support support the bill and and hope
 
04:49:33.830 --> 04:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
that you support it as well thank you
 
04:49:33.840 --> 04:49:35.030 align:start position:0%
that you support it as well thank you
questions

04:49:35.030 --> 04:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:49:37.670 --> 04:49:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
04:49:40.490 --> 04:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
just would it be uh do you have that
 
04:49:42.170 --> 04:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
citation with you now or is it something
 
04:49:44.990 --> 04:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
you have to get for us and if so would
 
04:49:46.850 --> 04:49:46.860 align:start position:0%
you be willing to
 
04:49:49.730 --> 04:49:49.740 align:start position:0%
um either pass it up or or
 
04:49:52.368 --> 04:49:52.378 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing nodding heads so uh Robert
 
04:49:54.050 --> 04:49:54.060 align:start position:0%
Berry who uh thank you for your question
 
04:49:56.030 --> 04:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
Robert Berry who's counsel for Medicaid
 
04:49:58.128 --> 04:49:58.138 align:start position:0%
I think can look that up and provide
 
04:50:01.010 --> 04:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
that to the committee thank you
 
04:50:03.288 --> 04:50:03.298 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
04:50:05.628 --> 04:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
04:50:07.610 --> 04:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
um we have some questions around whether
 
04:50:09.708 --> 04:50:09.718 align:start position:0%
this is a continuation of coverage
 
04:50:12.170 --> 04:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
without an eligibility determination or
 
04:50:14.750 --> 04:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
if this is only for eligible families so
 
04:50:16.070 --> 04:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
could I ask that and then I'll follow up
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
since I think that was clarifying
 
04:50:19.250 --> 04:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant's question
 
04:50:20.690 --> 04:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
04:50:23.930 --> 04:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
so an individual who is eligible for
 
04:50:23.940 --> 04:50:24.910 align:start position:0%
so an individual who is eligible for
Medicaid

04:50:24.910 --> 04:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
04:50:27.890 --> 04:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
ordinarily who's delivered a baby would
 
04:50:29.868 --> 04:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
have six just 60 days more of coverage
 
04:50:32.208 --> 04:50:32.218 align:start position:0%
to take care of their health care needs
 
04:50:34.490 --> 04:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
typically what this would then do is
 
04:50:37.250 --> 04:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
just extend that from 60 days to a year
 
04:50:37.260 --> 04:50:38.948 align:start position:0%
just extend that from 60 days to a year
so

04:50:38.948 --> 04:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:41.330 --> 04:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
they're under Medicaid for all
 
04:50:43.128 --> 04:50:43.138 align:start position:0%
eligibility groups if you have a change
 
04:50:45.170 --> 04:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
in circumstances you're supposed to
 
04:50:47.330 --> 04:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
report that and that that could but
 
04:50:50.350 --> 04:50:50.360 align:start position:0%
generally someone who remained eligible
 
04:50:52.490 --> 04:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
would have that eligibility for the
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
whole period I think the estimate of
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
number of women that we had you know was
 
04:50:58.680 --> 04:51:00.970 align:start position:0%
number of women that we had you know was
between

04:51:00.970 --> 04:51:00.980 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:51:05.930 --> 04:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
561 or so and 760 or so it's not a lot
 
04:51:08.330 --> 04:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
of of in terms of the entire population
 
04:51:10.730 --> 04:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program it's not a huge
 
04:51:12.350 --> 04:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
number of people that's why the the
 
04:51:15.050 --> 04:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
number to cover them is not not
 
04:51:16.910 --> 04:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise because some people are able
 
04:51:18.230 --> 04:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
to pick up coverage through other
 
04:51:20.510 --> 04:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
sources either through the Medicaid
 
04:51:22.390 --> 04:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
Program or outside of it
 
04:51:26.030 --> 04:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
so in clarification then those 560 to
 
04:51:28.970 --> 04:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
760 women those are women who were
 
04:51:30.650 --> 04:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
eligible when they were pregnant they
 
04:51:34.128 --> 04:51:34.138 align:start position:0%
lost eligibility around that 60 days so
 
04:51:35.990 --> 04:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
oh sorry you guys were well ahead of
 
04:51:38.810 --> 04:51:38.820 align:start position:0%
schedule uh so so okay so I see the
 
04:51:39.948 --> 04:51:39.958 align:start position:0%
nodding head
 
04:51:41.690 --> 04:51:41.700 align:start position:0%
um would these women otherwise be
 
04:51:43.788 --> 04:51:43.798 align:start position:0%
eligible as a changing circumstance to
 
04:51:45.410 --> 04:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
apply on the health Marketplace as well
 
04:51:48.410 --> 04:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
to have access to continued care if they
 
04:51:51.350 --> 04:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
fell into that Criterion and applied
 
04:51:53.628 --> 04:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
um then they they would they would be
 
04:51:55.190 --> 04:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
able to potentially access that but
 
04:51:58.670 --> 04:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
there are if you think about someone who
 
04:52:01.128 --> 04:52:01.138 align:start position:0%
is maybe taking a pregnancy leave they
 
04:52:04.128 --> 04:52:04.138 align:start position:0%
may not have the income to to be able to
 
04:52:06.410 --> 04:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
to qualify for another program
 
04:52:08.208 --> 04:52:08.218 align:start position:0%
sorry and just the last follow-up if
 
04:52:09.770 --> 04:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
they're on leave wouldn't they qualify
 
04:52:12.110 --> 04:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
for continued Medicaid Eligibility
 
04:52:14.810 --> 04:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
because they're not don't have income
 
04:52:16.430 --> 04:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
um well that would
 
04:52:18.110 --> 04:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
that would probably be true as well yes
 
04:52:19.490 --> 04:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:52:20.810 --> 04:52:20.820 align:start position:0%
other questions you've representative
 
04:52:20.820 --> 04:52:23.390 align:start position:0%
other questions you've representative
Weber

04:52:23.390 --> 04:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:25.368 --> 04:52:25.378 align:start position:0%
well those questions lead me to ask for
 
04:52:29.930 --> 04:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
clarification so now we understand if
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
somebody qualifies for Medicaid they get
 
04:52:35.930 --> 04:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
60 days worth of postpartum benefits
 
04:52:35.940 --> 04:52:37.810 align:start position:0%
60 days worth of postpartum benefits
services

04:52:37.810 --> 04:52:37.820 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:52:42.530 --> 04:52:42.540 align:start position:0%
so after the 60 days am I right in
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
thinking they still qualify for Medicaid
 
04:52:49.670 --> 04:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
but they are simply not qualified to
 
04:52:52.430 --> 04:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
receive specifically postpartum benefits
 
04:52:56.570 --> 04:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
or have I gotten that backwards
 
04:53:00.050 --> 04:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
it's not let me maybe
 
04:53:04.368 --> 04:53:04.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:06.770 --> 04:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
big eligibility okay so that eligibility
 
04:53:10.250 --> 04:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
group has Medicaid coverage only till 60
 
04:53:13.670 --> 04:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
days of postpartum and that's that's the
 
04:53:15.770 --> 04:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
issue is that it's okay it's not General
 
04:53:18.470 --> 04:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid it's the eligibility group of
 
04:53:21.050 --> 04:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
pregnant women so it's outside of the
 
04:53:23.390 --> 04:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
economic guidelines for the traditional
 
04:53:25.010 --> 04:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
medications okay thank you for
 
04:53:26.990 --> 04:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
clarifying that
 
04:53:33.110 --> 04:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:35.690 --> 04:53:35.700 align:start position:0%
uh representative Nagel
 
04:53:38.868 --> 04:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
I'm just um thank you for Mr chairman
 
04:53:40.368 --> 04:53:40.378 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:53:43.310 --> 04:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
um why 12 months
 
04:53:46.190 --> 04:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
um so generally Medicaid Eligibility
 
04:53:48.170 --> 04:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
spans you have to redetermine your
 
04:53:50.208 --> 04:53:50.218 align:start position:0%
eligibility every 12 months I think it's
 
04:53:53.750 --> 04:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
just making it consistent with that uh
 
04:53:56.030 --> 04:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
that you know we've had the exception to
 
04:54:00.288 --> 04:54:00.298 align:start position:0%
that since March of 2020 because of the
 
04:54:02.448 --> 04:54:02.458 align:start position:0%
federal public health emergency but all
 
04:54:04.850 --> 04:54:04.860 align:start position:0%
individuals have to and that are in the
 
04:54:06.708 --> 04:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program have a 12-month span
 
04:54:08.930 --> 04:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
again the only exception to that is if
 
04:54:10.310 --> 04:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
there's a change in circumstance that
 
04:54:12.970 --> 04:54:12.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:15.230 --> 04:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
04:54:16.730 --> 04:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:54:18.590 --> 04:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question it says I'm trying to
 
04:54:21.110 --> 04:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
you so up to 60 days they have coverage
 
04:54:24.530 --> 04:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
yes with this they go to 12 months and
 
04:54:26.090 --> 04:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to understand the Delta
 
04:54:29.330 --> 04:54:29.340 align:start position:0%
between two months and 12 months as to
 
04:54:31.490 --> 04:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
how many patients are have you been able
 
04:54:32.570 --> 04:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
to figure out how many patients are
 
04:54:35.090 --> 04:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
actually or postpartum women are
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
actually going to be impacted by this
 
04:54:39.350 --> 04:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
that was when we were thank you for the
 
04:54:41.090 --> 04:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
question when we were talking earlier
 
04:54:43.368 --> 04:54:43.378 align:start position:0%
about the range because every year the
 
04:54:45.590 --> 04:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
birth rate is different but I think we
 
04:54:46.850 --> 04:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
generally would see a range about
 
04:54:46.860 --> 04:54:48.070 align:start position:0%
generally would see a range about
between

04:54:48.070 --> 04:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:54:51.350 --> 04:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
560 to 760 based on historical
 
04:54:53.868 --> 04:54:53.878 align:start position:0%
experience on an annual basis and again
 
04:54:56.208 --> 04:54:56.218 align:start position:0%
that's why excuse me I think the fiscal
 
04:54:58.070 --> 04:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
note in terms of what the cost is not
 
04:54:59.990 --> 04:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
maybe as large as you might otherwise
 
04:55:03.350 --> 04:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
think it might be but it's a relatively
 
04:55:06.350 --> 04:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
small group of women who end up in this
 
04:55:08.628 --> 04:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
situation but meaningful to that those
 
04:55:08.638 --> 04:55:10.788 align:start position:0%
situation but meaningful to that those
families

04:55:10.788 --> 04:55:10.798 align:start position:0%
families
 
04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
well and follow up just thank you in
 
04:55:15.230 --> 04:55:15.240 align:start position:0%
some district is there a breakdown of
 
04:55:17.690 --> 04:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
the needed services that occur from like
 
04:55:19.128 --> 04:55:19.138 align:start position:0%
that two month to 12 I'm trying to
 
04:55:20.750 --> 04:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
understand is it postpartum depression
 
04:55:23.570 --> 04:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
is it whatever the other issues are do
 
04:55:24.830 --> 04:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
you have do you have that data broken
 
04:55:27.470 --> 04:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
down for that group of people we I mean
 
04:55:29.810 --> 04:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
in terms of putting together the the
 
04:55:32.750 --> 04:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
numbers for actuarially the diagnoses
 
04:55:34.490 --> 04:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
that they come in with so things like
 
04:55:39.230 --> 04:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.030 --> 04:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
again if you think about making medical
 
04:55:43.368 --> 04:55:43.378 align:start position:0%
appointments these days it's very hard
 
04:55:45.948 --> 04:55:45.958 align:start position:0%
to get everything possibly done it may
 
04:55:47.990 --> 04:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
be an infection it may be a cardiac
 
04:55:51.650 --> 04:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
situation it may be diabetes those I
 
04:55:53.690 --> 04:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
think are the common they're more
 
04:55:57.110 --> 04:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
commonly medical or or mental health
 
04:56:01.070 --> 04:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
could be substance use disorder too that
 
04:56:02.990 --> 04:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
there'd be getting assistance with and
 
04:56:05.150 --> 04:56:05.160 align:start position:0%
just getting that all done within 60
 
04:56:07.190 --> 04:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
days is very hard to do
 
04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
04:56:13.128 --> 04:56:13.138 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
04:56:14.990 --> 04:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
chairman it would be possible for you to
 
04:56:16.250 --> 04:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
provide the committee with the
 
04:56:17.690 --> 04:56:17.700 align:start position:0%
information about the eligibility
 
04:56:20.030 --> 04:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
criteria for pregnant women and for
 
04:56:21.170 --> 04:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
other people so that we can understand
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
what the differences are sure thank you
 
04:56:26.990 --> 04:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:56:29.448 --> 04:56:29.458 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much I have the
 
04:56:33.530 --> 04:56:33.540 align:start position:0%

I'm not sure if this got covered yet
 
04:57:32.570 --> 04:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
today but the reason we're sitting here
 
04:57:34.128 --> 04:57:34.138 align:start position:0%
is because of the committee of
 
04:57:36.410 --> 04:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
conference last year just to sort of
 
04:57:40.010 --> 04:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
refresh memory because the the policy
 
04:57:42.470 --> 04:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
decision about extending postpartum
 
04:57:45.050 --> 04:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
benefits to one year
 
04:57:47.750 --> 04:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
um was approved by this committee and
 
04:57:50.868 --> 04:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
then by the Full House and um and also
 
04:57:52.850 --> 04:57:52.860 align:start position:0%
by the Senate but then it get wrapped up
 
04:57:55.670 --> 04:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
in Committee of conference so this is
 
04:57:58.670 --> 04:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
sort of bringing back a bill that I
 
04:57:58.680 --> 04:57:59.810 align:start position:0%
sort of bringing back a bill that I
think

04:57:59.810 --> 04:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:58:01.730 --> 04:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
um you know was was looked at it
 
04:58:04.368 --> 04:58:04.378 align:start position:0%
provingly last year
 
04:58:08.448 --> 04:58:08.458 align:start position:0%
um this is a a policy issue this
 
04:58:10.670 --> 04:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
extension to one year as a policy issue
 
04:58:13.128 --> 04:58:13.138 align:start position:0%
which is supported by Catholic Bishops
 
04:58:17.690 --> 04:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
around the country as a pro-life measure
 
04:58:20.570 --> 04:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
um and I think that it's pretty clear
 
04:58:23.990 --> 04:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
that when you think about whether a bill
 
04:58:26.448 --> 04:58:26.458 align:start position:0%
like this advances the common good that
 
04:58:29.570 --> 04:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
it does and we always keep coming back
 
04:58:31.788 --> 04:58:31.798 align:start position:0%
to the common good and human dignity
 
04:58:34.070 --> 04:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
when we look at bills and that's not
 
04:58:36.230 --> 04:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
just a religious thing but as you know
 
04:58:38.330 --> 04:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
part one article one of the New
 
04:58:40.910 --> 04:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution says that that
 
04:58:43.550 --> 04:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
government is instituted for the general
 
04:58:43.560 --> 04:58:45.470 align:start position:0%
government is instituted for the general
good

04:58:45.470 --> 04:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:58:49.310 --> 04:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
um and so um you know there were I the
 
04:58:53.030 --> 04:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
family is the Keystone of our society
 
04:58:55.788 --> 04:58:55.798 align:start position:0%
right we would all agree on that
 
04:58:57.830 --> 04:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
regardless of our
 
04:59:00.530 --> 04:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
um political perspectives or persuasion
 
04:59:03.230 --> 04:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
and there's really few ways that we
 
04:59:06.410 --> 04:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
could better support families than by
 
04:59:09.948 --> 04:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
supporting and prioritizing the needs of
 
04:59:13.850 --> 04:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
mothers and babies and
 
04:59:15.890 --> 04:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
um I keep coming back when I think about
 
04:59:20.208 --> 04:59:20.218 align:start position:0%
this bill to the fact that for those uh
 
04:59:22.010 --> 04:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
you know relatively small number of
 
04:59:25.730 --> 04:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
people that are being impacted by this
 
04:59:27.730 --> 04:59:27.740 align:start position:0%
uh initiative
 
04:59:31.190 --> 04:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
each one of the mothers
 
04:59:34.250 --> 04:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
and each one of the the children that
 
04:59:37.788 --> 04:59:37.798 align:start position:0%
are involved that benefit from this
 
04:59:40.970 --> 04:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
legislation and from this law
 
04:59:44.030 --> 04:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
um are is you know is one more mother
 
04:59:48.050 --> 04:59:48.060 align:start position:0%
one more child that is undoubtedly going
 
04:59:51.830 --> 04:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
to have a better future than would have
 
04:59:55.128 --> 04:59:55.138 align:start position:0%
been the case otherwise
 
04:59:57.590 --> 04:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
um so that's why we think this bill is
 
05:00:00.530 --> 05:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
such a good idea and we'd ask you to
 
05:00:03.470 --> 05:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
vote in favor thank you thank you
 
05:00:03.480 --> 05:00:06.590 align:start position:0%
vote in favor thank you thank you

05:00:09.708 --> 05:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
any questions you see no questions okay
 
05:00:15.708 --> 05:00:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:18.410 --> 05:00:18.420 align:start position:0%

you have three minutes ma'am good
 
05:00:45.410 --> 05:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
afternoon chairman McDonald

um Vice chair Leon and members of the of
 
05:00:51.650 --> 05:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Nancy Vaughn

and I am government relations director
 
05:00:55.850 --> 05:00:55.860 align:start position:0%
for the American Heart Association here
 
05:00:58.368 --> 05:00:58.378 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I have passed around
 
05:01:01.750 --> 05:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
written testimony attached to that is
 
05:01:04.910 --> 05:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
the American Heart association's fact
 
05:01:07.368 --> 05:01:07.378 align:start position:0%
sheet on maternal Health which goes into
 
05:01:09.770 --> 05:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
more detail than I will do in my
 
05:01:11.690 --> 05:01:11.700 align:start position:0%
testimony today as to why we we support
 
05:01:15.350 --> 05:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
this but we we do support this um this
 
05:01:15.360 --> 05:01:17.110 align:start position:0%
this but we we do support this um this
policy

05:01:17.110 --> 05:01:17.120 align:start position:0%
policy
 
05:01:19.330 --> 05:01:19.340 align:start position:0%
the American Heart Association
 
05:01:22.610 --> 05:01:22.620 align:start position:0%
recognizes that this is a leading cause
 
05:01:25.670 --> 05:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
of death for new moms in this country
 
05:01:30.310 --> 05:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
tree one in three
 
05:01:34.368 --> 05:01:34.378 align:start position:0%
postpartum pregnancy related deaths is
 
05:01:39.050 --> 05:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
due to cardiovascular disease so it is a
 
05:01:43.610 --> 05:01:43.620 align:start position:0%
policy that time has come to to pass and
 
05:01:46.788 --> 05:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
and get this get this into law in New
 
05:01:46.798 --> 05:01:48.128 align:start position:0%
and get this get this into law in New
Hampshire

05:01:48.128 --> 05:01:48.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:01:51.650 --> 05:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
the American Heart Association is
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
working in General on maternal health
 
05:01:57.170 --> 05:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
issues women in heart disease is has
 
05:01:59.350 --> 05:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
been a big issue we have been working on
 
05:02:04.090 --> 05:02:04.100 align:start position:0%
for many years and with maternal
 
05:02:08.090 --> 05:02:08.100 align:start position:0%
mortality rates as they are by working
 
05:02:10.368 --> 05:02:10.378 align:start position:0%
on this issue we hope to improve the
 
05:02:13.010 --> 05:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular health of women and
 
05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
prevent death that that is happening so
 
05:02:20.150 --> 05:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
Medicaid the Medicaid Program plays a
 
05:02:21.948 --> 05:02:21.958 align:start position:0%
real important role in maternal health
 
05:02:25.750 --> 05:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
and perinatal outcomes in time
 
05:02:28.128 --> 05:02:28.138 align:start position:0%
postpartum visits which gets to some of
 
05:02:30.850 --> 05:02:30.860 align:start position:0%
the questions that were just just asked
 
05:02:34.390 --> 05:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
provides an opportunity to address
 
05:02:37.010 --> 05:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
health issues that may not have been
 
05:02:39.110 --> 05:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
known to the individual prior to her
 
05:02:42.250 --> 05:02:42.260 align:start position:0%
pregnancy but but is now
 
05:02:45.530 --> 05:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
and also any pregnancy related
 
05:02:49.850 --> 05:02:49.860 align:start position:0%
complications that that have Arisen many
 
05:02:53.690 --> 05:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
of these complications we don't see in
 
05:02:58.610 --> 05:02:58.620 align:start position:0%
postpartum moms from like 41 days on out
 
05:03:01.070 --> 05:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
to the the end of that that first year
 
05:03:03.770 --> 05:03:03.780 align:start position:0%
and a little bit beyond even so that is
 
05:03:05.750 --> 05:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
that is why the 12 months is something
 
05:03:08.830 --> 05:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
that's very important to us it is a time
 
05:03:12.530 --> 05:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
for having regular appointments if a
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
sudden appointment needs to be made
 
05:03:16.010 --> 05:03:16.020 align:start position:0%
there's time for that wherein 60 days
 
05:03:18.650 --> 05:03:18.660 align:start position:0%
you just don't have time for that for
 
05:03:21.410 --> 05:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
conditions that we hope to get managed
 
05:03:24.530 --> 05:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
treated overcome so that it does not
 
05:03:26.990 --> 05:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
result in more serious illness down the
 
05:03:29.868 --> 05:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
road particularly once they may find
 
05:03:32.208 --> 05:03:32.218 align:start position:0%
themselves no longer insured then they
 
05:03:34.070 --> 05:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
won't have access to health care except
 
05:03:35.868 --> 05:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
for if they were paying out of pocket
 
05:03:39.650 --> 05:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
for this or it comes down to hospitals
 
05:03:43.208 --> 05:03:43.218 align:start position:0%
and health care providers having to give
 
05:03:47.150 --> 05:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
unreimbursed care for these patients
 
05:03:50.448 --> 05:03:50.458 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to repeat what others
 
05:03:53.208 --> 05:03:53.218 align:start position:0%
have said before if you do have any
 
05:03:53.218 --> 05:03:54.190 align:start position:0%
have said before if you do have any
questions

05:03:54.190 --> 05:03:54.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:03:57.110 --> 05:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
my email and phone number is on my my
 
05:03:59.810 --> 05:03:59.820 align:start position:0%
testimony but I will take any questions
 
05:04:01.730 --> 05:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
and hopefully be able to answer them for
 
05:04:03.230 --> 05:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
you okay great
 
05:04:05.628 --> 05:04:05.638 align:start position:0%
uh yes go ahead Chef King thank you
 
05:04:07.070 --> 05:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
chairman McDonald thank you for being
 
05:04:08.030 --> 05:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
here today
 
05:04:09.650 --> 05:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
um thank you you weren't here earlier I
 
05:04:11.650 --> 05:04:11.660 align:start position:0%
don't believe but we had we were
 
05:04:15.050 --> 05:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
learning about another bill and uh which
 
05:04:17.030 --> 05:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
had a topic similar to what you're
 
05:04:19.610 --> 05:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
referring to and that is postpartum or
 
05:04:23.330 --> 05:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh deaths within 12 months of more you
 
05:04:26.448 --> 05:04:26.458 align:start position:0%
know maternal mortality and um one of
 
05:04:28.010 --> 05:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
the witnesses
 
05:04:30.288 --> 05:04:30.298 align:start position:0%
um testified that there's roughly 11
 
05:04:32.570 --> 05:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
deaths annually
 
05:04:32.580 --> 05:04:33.170 align:start position:0%
deaths annually
um

05:04:33.170 --> 05:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:35.448 --> 05:04:35.458 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire but she
 
05:04:35.458 --> 05:04:36.530 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire but she
also

05:04:36.530 --> 05:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:04:40.250 --> 05:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
um she also specified that those are
 
05:04:42.708 --> 05:04:42.718 align:start position:0%
basically almost all drug related deaths
 
05:04:46.550 --> 05:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
do you concur with that I believe that
 
05:04:46.560 --> 05:04:47.448 align:start position:0%
do you concur with that I believe that
there's

05:04:47.448 --> 05:04:47.458 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:04:49.610 --> 05:04:49.620 align:start position:0%
um also within that number is about five
 
05:04:51.650 --> 05:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
maybe that were cardiovascular related
 
05:04:54.110 --> 05:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
as well but yes in New Hampshire it
 
05:04:55.190 --> 05:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
might be a little different than what
 
05:04:56.770 --> 05:04:56.780 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in the rest of the country
 
05:04:59.830 --> 05:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
and again I I just believe that
 
05:05:02.628 --> 05:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
addressing substance abuse issues if if
 
05:05:05.510 --> 05:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
that is what what the problem is is very
 
05:05:05.520 --> 05:05:06.730 align:start position:0%
that is what what the problem is is very
important

05:05:06.730 --> 05:05:06.740 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:05:09.410 --> 05:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
for that cardiovascular health as well
 
05:05:11.150 --> 05:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
as as just saving their lives and
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
helping them go on to being moms to
 
05:05:16.368 --> 05:05:16.378 align:start position:0%
their their children
 
05:05:20.448 --> 05:05:20.458 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative Weber
 
05:05:22.490 --> 05:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
thank you and if you know
 
05:05:22.500 --> 05:05:23.030 align:start position:0%
thank you and if you know
um

05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:27.288 --> 05:05:27.298 align:start position:0%
do you have any estimate
 
05:05:31.190 --> 05:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
um comparing the number of cardiac
 
05:05:35.810 --> 05:05:35.820 align:start position:0%
deaths with the number of people who
 
05:05:39.770 --> 05:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
need treatment past 60 days who don't
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
die but who have conditions whether it
 
05:05:46.610 --> 05:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
be heart cardiovascular whether it be
 
05:05:48.590 --> 05:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
substance abuse whether it be diabetes
 
05:05:52.070 --> 05:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
that still need required treatment right
 
05:05:54.410 --> 05:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
um I don't have you know exact figures
 
05:05:58.250 --> 05:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
on that but what we do say within the
 
05:06:01.128 --> 05:06:01.138 align:start position:0%
materials that I had distributed is that
 
05:06:04.250 --> 05:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
we believe so one in three we know die
 
05:06:06.530 --> 05:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
from cardiovascular disease we believe
 
05:06:09.890 --> 05:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
that two of those three deaths can be
 
05:06:12.170 --> 05:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
prevented and so that would cover all of
 
05:06:15.050 --> 05:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:18.770 --> 05:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:21.170 --> 05:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
see no other questions okay thank you
 
05:06:26.030 --> 05:06:26.040 align:start position:0%

05:06:54.350 --> 05:06:54.360 align:start position:0%

representing Nami New Hampshire speaking
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
in support of house bill 565.
 
05:07:20.570 --> 05:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
um the United States is the only
 
05:07:22.670 --> 05:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
industrialized industrialized Nation
 
05:07:27.530 --> 05:07:27.540 align:start position:0%
where maternal mortality is on the rise
 
05:07:29.448 --> 05:07:29.458 align:start position:0%
um and there's an increasing number of
 
05:07:30.770 --> 05:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
maternal deaths that are occurring in
 
05:07:33.288 --> 05:07:33.298 align:start position:0%
the postpartum period
 
05:07:35.390 --> 05:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
um data from the center of Disease
 
05:07:36.770 --> 05:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
Control and prevention showed that about
 
05:07:38.810 --> 05:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
one-third of all pregnancy related
 
05:07:41.628 --> 05:07:41.638 align:start position:0%
deaths happen one week to one year after
 
05:07:45.230 --> 05:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
pregnancy ends and getting to something
 
05:07:46.368 --> 05:07:46.378 align:start position:0%
that one of the representatives
 
05:07:49.070 --> 05:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned about you know data within New
 
05:07:51.770 --> 05:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I couldn't find the 2022
 
05:07:54.288 --> 05:07:54.298 align:start position:0%
annual report on maternal mortality so
 
05:07:58.310 --> 05:07:58.320 align:start position:0%
I've got the 2021 report that has 2019
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
data in it but according to that report
 
05:08:05.270 --> 05:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
half of the deaths there were eight of
 
05:08:08.750 --> 05:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
them that year occurred in the six to 12
 
05:08:10.910 --> 05:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
month range postpartum so it would have
 
05:08:13.970 --> 05:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
occurred after this 60 days would have
 
05:08:16.190 --> 05:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
ended if these folks were on Medicaid
 
05:08:16.200 --> 05:08:17.690 align:start position:0%
ended if these folks were on Medicaid
and

05:08:17.690 --> 05:08:17.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:08:20.750 --> 05:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
um just to that point
 
05:08:23.448 --> 05:08:23.458 align:start position:0%
four of those deaths were overdosed two
 
05:08:25.490 --> 05:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
of them were suicide and two of them
 
05:08:27.470 --> 05:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
were medical causes which is why Nami
 
05:08:29.628 --> 05:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a strong interest in
 
05:08:33.350 --> 05:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
this bill because a lot of the mortality
 
05:08:37.250 --> 05:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
that happens with our women who are
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
postpartum is substance use and mental
 
05:08:42.010 --> 05:08:42.020 align:start position:0%
health related
 
05:08:44.448 --> 05:08:44.458 align:start position:0%
additionally one of the most prevalent
 
05:08:46.910 --> 05:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
illnesses facing postpartum moms is
 
05:08:49.550 --> 05:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
depression according to America's Health
 
05:08:52.788 --> 05:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
rankings 11.2 percent
 
05:08:55.368 --> 05:08:55.378 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire women with a recent
 
05:08:57.590 --> 05:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
live birth reported experiencing
 
05:08:59.868 --> 05:08:59.878 align:start position:0%
depressive symptoms so I think that gets
 
05:09:01.490 --> 05:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
to somebody's question about you know
 
05:09:05.030 --> 05:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
data regarding some of these illnesses
 
05:09:08.270 --> 05:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
so that's 11.1 percent of New Hampshire
 
05:09:11.090 --> 05:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
moms are experiencing some sort of
 
05:09:15.470 --> 05:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:17.448 --> 05:09:17.458 align:start position:0%
we also know that the children of women
 
05:09:19.550 --> 05:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
who experience postpartum depression are
 
05:09:22.610 --> 05:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
affected research has demonstrated that
 
05:09:24.050 --> 05:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
there's an association between
 
05:09:26.510 --> 05:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
postpartum depression and delayed
 
05:09:28.390 --> 05:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
cognitive and language development
 
05:09:30.650 --> 05:09:30.660 align:start position:0%
disorganized or insecure attachment
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
higher rates of behavioral problems and
 
05:09:36.410 --> 05:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
lower grades there's also a documented
 
05:09:38.150 --> 05:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
link between postpartum depression and
 
05:09:40.128 --> 05:09:40.138 align:start position:0%
the higher rates of depression in
 
05:09:42.708 --> 05:09:42.718 align:start position:0%
children when they become teens
 
05:09:45.708 --> 05:09:45.718 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons the the strong
 
05:09:47.390 --> 05:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
mental health connection
 
05:09:49.850 --> 05:09:49.860 align:start position:0%
um between
 
05:09:53.090 --> 05:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
women who have just given birth and also
 
05:09:54.590 --> 05:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
the connection to their children later
 
05:09:56.868 --> 05:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
in life Nami New Hampshire strongly
 
05:09:59.690 --> 05:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
supports this bill
 
05:10:04.128 --> 05:10:04.138 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much uh questions
 
05:10:08.208 --> 05:10:08.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:10.490 --> 05:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
so is it fair for me to conclude that
 
05:10:12.708 --> 05:10:12.718 align:start position:0%
whatever we spend now
 
05:10:15.830 --> 05:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
on maternal and child health in that
 
05:10:19.070 --> 05:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
first year is going to save us money
 
05:10:20.270 --> 05:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
down the road
 
05:10:22.788 --> 05:10:22.798 align:start position:0%
in terms of additional mental and
 
05:10:25.430 --> 05:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
physical health issues it will save
 
05:10:27.650 --> 05:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
money not only for the mom but for the
 
05:10:29.750 --> 05:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
child as well thank you I don't have
 
05:10:33.770 --> 05:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
return on investment figures but yes
 
05:10:39.050 --> 05:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:45.170 --> 05:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:47.270 --> 05:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
last person who has signed up to testify
 
05:10:49.850 --> 05:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
on this bill today Mackenzie Nicholson
 
05:10:59.510 --> 05:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:01.670 --> 05:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman McDonald members
 
05:11:02.930 --> 05:11:02.940 align:start position:0%
of the committee thanks so much for
 
05:11:04.430 --> 05:11:04.440 align:start position:0%

we've heard a lot today plus there's a
 
05:11:09.110 --> 05:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
cute little baby in the room that we're
 
05:11:11.448 --> 05:11:11.458 align:start position:0%
all going and going over
 
05:11:13.190 --> 05:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
um so my name is Mackenzie Nicholson I'm
 
05:11:14.750 --> 05:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
the senior director of moms Rising here
 
05:11:16.490 --> 05:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire an on the ground
 
05:11:18.708 --> 05:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
Grassroots movement representing tens of
 
05:11:21.050 --> 05:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
thousands of moms in the granite state
 
05:11:22.730 --> 05:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
I want to share a little bit about my
 
05:11:24.770 --> 05:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
story which is that when
 
05:11:27.368 --> 05:11:27.378 align:start position:0%
um when I had my first child
 
05:11:29.690 --> 05:11:29.700 align:start position:0%
those first few months we came home from
 
05:11:31.250 --> 05:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
the hospital were some of the hardest of
 
05:11:32.090 --> 05:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
my life
 
05:11:34.128 --> 05:11:34.138 align:start position:0%
you know stresses with a colicky baby
 
05:11:36.170 --> 05:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
who really didn't want to have any of
 
05:11:38.690 --> 05:11:38.700 align:start position:0%
the formula that we had to give him not
 
05:11:40.250 --> 05:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
to mention added Financial stress it was
 
05:11:42.288 --> 05:11:42.298 align:start position:0%
a really hard time for me but luckily
 
05:11:43.788 --> 05:11:43.798 align:start position:0%
for me I was covered by New Hampshire's
 
05:11:45.650 --> 05:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program we fit the eligibility
 
05:11:47.750 --> 05:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
for criteria for the program and it was
 
05:11:49.190 --> 05:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
hugely helpful
 
05:11:51.170 --> 05:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
but pregnant people and birthing people
 
05:11:52.910 --> 05:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are directly impacted
 
05:11:54.830 --> 05:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
by Medicaid with one in four births in
 
05:11:56.288 --> 05:11:56.298 align:start position:0%
the state being covered by Medicaid
 
05:11:58.550 --> 05:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
women and birthing people to your
 
05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
question representative often experience
 
05:12:02.090 --> 05:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
a lot of pregnancy related complications
 
05:12:05.150 --> 05:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
that extend beyond 60 days postpartum
 
05:12:07.510 --> 05:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
including for things like hypertension
 
05:12:09.590 --> 05:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
mental health struggles gestational
 
05:12:11.208 --> 05:12:11.218 align:start position:0%
diabetes things like that that require
 
05:12:13.550 --> 05:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
attention for longer than 60 days not to
 
05:12:16.128 --> 05:12:16.138 align:start position:0%
mention getting an appointment
 
05:12:17.990 --> 05:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
um our current state law only allows for
 
05:12:20.150 --> 05:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
that 60 days of coverage
 
05:12:23.990 --> 05:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
another very sad and you know scary fact
 
05:12:26.030 --> 05:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
is that the United States is one of the
 
05:12:28.010 --> 05:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
most dangerous places to give birth in
 
05:12:30.230 --> 05:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
the developed world with major racial
 
05:12:30.240 --> 05:12:31.270 align:start position:0%
the developed world with major racial
disparities

05:12:31.270 --> 05:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
disparities
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
especially affecting black women who
 
05:12:35.270 --> 05:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
lose their lives at three to four times
 
05:12:37.510 --> 05:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
the rate of white women and that's
 
05:12:41.090 --> 05:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
separate from age economic background or
 
05:12:43.670 --> 05:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
education and a recent CDC report that I
 
05:12:45.590 --> 05:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
looked at actually showed that about 80
 
05:12:47.330 --> 05:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
percent of those maternal deaths are
 
05:12:47.340 --> 05:12:48.430 align:start position:0%
percent of those maternal deaths are
preventable

05:12:48.430 --> 05:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
preventable
 
05:12:51.288 --> 05:12:51.298 align:start position:0%
and that same report shows that 53
 
05:12:53.570 --> 05:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
percent of maternity maternal related
 
05:12:55.788 --> 05:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
deaths occurred between seven days and
 
05:12:58.430 --> 05:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
one year postpartum
 
05:13:00.770 --> 05:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
as a mom that struggled with my own
 
05:13:04.670 --> 05:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
postpartum depression uh I I'm hopeful
 
05:13:06.650 --> 05:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
that we are able to pass this extent
 
05:13:07.970 --> 05:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
extended coverage in New Hampshire
 
05:13:10.250 --> 05:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
looking back if I had known that we I
 
05:13:11.750 --> 05:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
would have had access to continuous
 
05:13:13.250 --> 05:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
continuous Health Care coverage I would
 
05:13:15.170 --> 05:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
have been able to focus on recovering
 
05:13:16.730 --> 05:13:16.740 align:start position:0%
from a C-section which is a major
 
05:13:19.368 --> 05:13:19.378 align:start position:0%
surgery but instead I was thinking about
 
05:13:20.990 --> 05:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
where am I going to find insurance
 
05:13:23.030 --> 05:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
coverage if my employer doesn't offer it
 
05:13:24.410 --> 05:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
and worrying about how are we going to
 
05:13:26.690 --> 05:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
pay for those medical bills if they do
 
05:13:28.850 --> 05:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
come up
 
05:13:30.530 --> 05:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
um I was excited when the American
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
Rescue plan allowed for this extended
 
05:13:35.090 --> 05:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
coverage to I know tell me about it
 
05:13:35.100 --> 05:13:36.410 align:start position:0%
coverage to I know tell me about it
buddy

05:13:36.410 --> 05:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
buddy
 
05:13:36.420 --> 05:13:37.070 align:start position:0%
buddy
um

05:13:37.070 --> 05:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:38.930 --> 05:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
to answer another question there are 29
 
05:13:40.430 --> 05:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
states in the country that have already
 
05:13:42.170 --> 05:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
passed this extended coverage with five
 
05:13:44.270 --> 05:13:44.280 align:start position:0%
others who are working on implementing
 
05:13:47.090 --> 05:13:47.100 align:start position:0%
implementing the policy New Hampshire is
 
05:13:48.770 --> 05:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
the only state in the Northeast that
 
05:13:51.288 --> 05:13:51.298 align:start position:0%
isn't on that path already
 
05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
um lastly last thing I'll say to you is
 
05:13:55.910 --> 05:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
in a report for the Texas legislature
 
05:13:58.310 --> 05:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
researchers showed that coverage that
 
05:14:00.770 --> 05:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
was provided to postpartum women during
 
05:14:03.650 --> 05:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
the pandemic benefited maternal health
 
05:14:06.890 --> 05:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
so hugely that um women used twice as
 
05:14:09.650 --> 05:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
many postpartum Services after that
 
05:14:12.050 --> 05:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
60-day period between 2 and 10 times as
 
05:14:13.910 --> 05:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
many preventative contraceptive and
 
05:14:15.350 --> 05:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
mental and Behavioral Health Services
 
05:14:20.030 --> 05:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
and 37 percent accessed 37 percent fewer
 
05:14:21.948 --> 05:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
folks access Services related to short
 
05:14:23.750 --> 05:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
interval pregnancies within that first
 
05:14:23.760 --> 05:14:24.530 align:start position:0%
interval pregnancies within that first
year

05:14:24.530 --> 05:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
and the last couple weeks in the
 
05:14:28.910 --> 05:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
Northeast has showed us that Devastation
 
05:14:30.770 --> 05:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
can truly take place when there aren't
 
05:14:32.750 --> 05:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
safeguards for moms in their postpartum
 
05:14:34.730 --> 05:14:34.740 align:start position:0%
State and it's hitting close to home and
 
05:14:37.730 --> 05:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
we I like my myself and many other moms
 
05:14:39.830 --> 05:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
Rising members are not
 
05:14:41.690 --> 05:14:41.700 align:start position:0%
um immune to those crippling effects of
 
05:14:43.788 --> 05:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
postpartum depression so on behalf of
 
05:14:47.150 --> 05:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
myself mom's Rising members we kindly
 
05:14:49.670 --> 05:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
ask you to pass this bill and support
 
05:14:52.128 --> 05:14:52.138 align:start position:0%
pregnant and postnatal moms okay thank
 
05:14:56.390 --> 05:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:59.208 --> 05:14:59.218 align:start position:0%
saying no questions
 
05:15:03.050 --> 05:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:04.730 --> 05:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
I know of no one else signed up to
 
05:15:06.830 --> 05:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
testify does anyone else wish to testify
 
05:15:08.930 --> 05:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
05:15:11.868 --> 05:15:11.878 align:start position:0%
that's bill 565.
 
05:15:13.490 --> 05:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none I am going to close the
 
05:15:16.550 --> 05:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 565 and
 
05:15:18.170 --> 05:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on House Bill
 
05:15:21.708 --> 05:15:21.718 align:start position:0%
580. and to begin I would recognize the
 
05:15:23.510 --> 05:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative haken
 
05:15:23.520 --> 05:15:29.930 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor representative haken
Phillips

05:15:29.930 --> 05:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:29.940 --> 05:15:34.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:15:34.490 --> 05:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:36.770 --> 05:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
 
05:15:38.570 --> 05:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
members for the record my name is
 
05:15:41.448 --> 05:15:41.458 align:start position:0%
representative Mary hacken Phillips I
 
05:15:42.948 --> 05:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
represent Grafton County District 12
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
along with representative Murphy
 
05:15:45.120 --> 05:15:45.708 align:start position:0%
along with representative Murphy
um

05:15:45.708 --> 05:15:45.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:47.990 --> 05:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
which covers Hanover and lime
 
05:15:50.930 --> 05:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
so I'm here to introduce HB 580
 
05:15:52.368 --> 05:15:52.378 align:start position:0%
which would establish a children's
 
05:15:54.530 --> 05:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
vision screening initiative within the
 
05:15:57.650 --> 05:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:00.530 --> 05:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
the reason why I'm here today before you
 
05:16:02.750 --> 05:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
is because of the problem which is known
 
05:16:02.760 --> 05:16:03.670 align:start position:0%
is because of the problem which is known
as

05:16:03.670 --> 05:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:16:07.730 --> 05:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
amblyopia which is a mouthful but it's
 
05:16:10.610 --> 05:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
sometimes called the lazy eye disorder
 
05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
and it is the most common cause of
 
05:16:15.350 --> 05:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
vision loss in children and occurs in
 
05:16:17.390 --> 05:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
about two to four percent of young
 
05:16:19.730 --> 05:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
children ages somewhere between six
 
05:16:21.948 --> 05:16:21.958 align:start position:0%
months and six years
 
05:16:23.990 --> 05:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
this is about two out of every 100
 
05:16:26.030 --> 05:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
Granite State children
 
05:16:28.310 --> 05:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
with this disorder vision is impaired
 
05:16:30.110 --> 05:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
due to abnormal development of the
 
05:16:31.970 --> 05:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
neural connections between the brain and
 
05:16:34.368 --> 05:16:34.378 align:start position:0%
the eye during early childhood
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
primary causes of this are misalignment
 
05:16:40.310 --> 05:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
of the eyes and it's basically a
 
05:16:41.868 --> 05:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
refractive error if you want to get into
 
05:16:43.788 --> 05:16:43.798 align:start position:0%
the technical
 
05:16:46.010 --> 05:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
um explanation I'm sure Dr Murphy could
 
05:16:48.708 --> 05:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:50.750 --> 05:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
um typically this vision loss affects
 
05:16:52.610 --> 05:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
only one eye but
 
05:16:54.590 --> 05:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
um people with amblyopia are nearly
 
05:16:56.330 --> 05:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
three times more likely to develop this
 
05:16:57.890 --> 05:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
Vision impairment and they're better
 
05:17:01.310 --> 05:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
seeing eyes later in life so early
 
05:17:03.770 --> 05:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
detection of amblyopia is critical this
 
05:17:05.990 --> 05:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
treatment is the most successful when
 
05:17:08.628 --> 05:17:08.638 align:start position:0%
initiated before the child reached seven
 
05:17:10.788 --> 05:17:10.798 align:start position:0%
years of age
 
05:17:13.250 --> 05:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
the battle to prevent this vision loss
 
05:17:16.070 --> 05:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
due to amblyopia is a winnable battle as
 
05:17:18.530 --> 05:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
many of our experts tell us and other
 
05:17:20.150 --> 05:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
countries have definitely made strides
 
05:17:23.448 --> 05:17:23.458 align:start position:0%
towards eradicating this vision loss as
 
05:17:25.490 --> 05:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
well as other states in our country
 
05:17:27.890 --> 05:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
without early treatment amblyopia cannot
 
05:17:29.990 --> 05:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
lead to or it can lead to the permanent
 
05:17:32.570 --> 05:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
vision loss in one or both of our eyes
 
05:17:36.650 --> 05:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:38.270 --> 05:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
um according to the experts that I've
 
05:17:40.670 --> 05:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
spoken to in our state New Hampshire is
 
05:17:42.410 --> 05:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
actually one of nine or ten states in
 
05:17:43.910 --> 05:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
the country that does not have a
 
05:17:45.830 --> 05:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
government-sponsored kids vision
 
05:17:47.628 --> 05:17:47.638 align:start position:0%
screening program
 
05:17:50.208 --> 05:17:50.218 align:start position:0%
I'm told that about 25 years ago the New
 
05:17:51.890 --> 05:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire advisory Council of vision
 
05:17:54.050 --> 05:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
screening was established and it
 
05:17:56.750 --> 05:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
reviewed childhood Vision screenings as
 
05:17:58.430 --> 05:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
a public health concern
 
05:18:00.230 --> 05:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
and historically there was a push to
 
05:18:02.990 --> 05:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
screen children and their Vision at
 
05:18:04.490 --> 05:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
daycare centers throughout the state
 
05:18:06.830 --> 05:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
particularly in the North Country it was
 
05:18:09.288 --> 05:18:09.298 align:start position:0%
an example I heard about but my
 
05:18:11.330 --> 05:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
understanding is that since the covid-19
 
05:18:15.110 --> 05:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic the public health efforts have
 
05:18:17.448 --> 05:18:17.458 align:start position:0%
rightfully so been geared towards
 
05:18:20.448 --> 05:18:20.458 align:start position:0%
fighting covid-19 and
 
05:18:21.830 --> 05:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
um does
 
05:18:24.288 --> 05:18:24.298 align:start position:0%
emphasis on Vision screens had declined
 
05:18:25.850 --> 05:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
05:18:27.770 --> 05:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
so amongst the reasons for declining
 
05:18:29.208 --> 05:18:29.218 align:start position:0%
screenings beyond that public health
 
05:18:32.150 --> 05:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
Focus being elsewhere is that you know
 
05:18:34.670 --> 05:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates here in the state
 
05:18:36.830 --> 05:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
are pretty low and Healthcare
 
05:18:38.690 --> 05:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
professionals time is extremely valuable
 
05:18:39.948 --> 05:18:39.958 align:start position:0%
so when they're making those
 
05:18:42.948 --> 05:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
cost-effective analysis about which
 
05:18:42.958 --> 05:18:43.910 align:start position:0%
cost-effective analysis about which
um

05:18:43.910 --> 05:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:46.190 --> 05:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
cases to take the screenings do not
 
05:18:49.430 --> 05:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
reach that top of that priority list
 
05:18:52.368 --> 05:18:52.378 align:start position:0%
so anyway I digress this bill proposes a
 
05:18:54.890 --> 05:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
limited goal which is to improve
 
05:18:56.390 --> 05:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
childhood vision screening numbers
 
05:18:57.770 --> 05:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
05:19:00.530 --> 05:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
so this bill is very limited in scope
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm intending to reach the goal of
 
05:19:04.970 --> 05:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
increasing those vision screening
 
05:19:04.980 --> 05:19:05.750 align:start position:0%
increasing those vision screening
numbers

05:19:05.750 --> 05:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
05:19:09.410 --> 05:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
by just focusing on children ages zero
 
05:19:10.970 --> 05:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
to six to have enrolled in the State
 
05:19:12.590 --> 05:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program
 
05:19:14.628 --> 05:19:14.638 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking about all uninsured
 
05:19:16.490 --> 05:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
and insured children even though that is
 
05:19:18.170 --> 05:19:18.180 align:start position:0%
a lofty goal
 
05:19:20.810 --> 05:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
we're narrowing down in ages zero to six
 
05:19:22.788 --> 05:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
because screenings before kids enter
 
05:19:24.948 --> 05:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
school is really critical because you
 
05:19:27.410 --> 05:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
want to treat by age seven to reverse
 
05:19:30.288 --> 05:19:30.298 align:start position:0%
the effects of this disorder
 
05:19:31.788 --> 05:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
um and if treatment is not administered
 
05:19:33.410 --> 05:19:33.420 align:start position:0%
by that age group obviously the
 
05:19:35.690 --> 05:19:35.700 align:start position:0%
disability could become permanent so
 
05:19:38.270 --> 05:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking a small window of time so
 
05:19:41.690 --> 05:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
a specific year a group of children
 
05:19:43.788 --> 05:19:43.798 align:start position:0%
we're limiting this initiative to
 
05:19:45.890 --> 05:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
special screenings for kids that are not
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
reading at a grade level upon entering
 
05:19:49.128 --> 05:19:49.138 align:start position:0%
the third grade
 
05:19:51.230 --> 05:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
which is about the same age group that
 
05:19:52.788 --> 05:19:52.798 align:start position:0%
we were just talking about
 
05:19:54.948 --> 05:19:54.958 align:start position:0%
and also at the request of teachers
 
05:19:57.650 --> 05:19:57.660 align:start position:0%
through a school administrator who you
 
05:20:00.770 --> 05:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
know notice a lag in the reading skills
 
05:20:01.850 --> 05:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
of a child
 
05:20:04.368 --> 05:20:04.378 align:start position:0%
this is obviously intended to catch
 
05:20:07.550 --> 05:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
vision problems that um become evident
 
05:20:09.890 --> 05:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
after this initial screening for when
 
05:20:12.910 --> 05:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
the student enters the school system
 
05:20:15.470 --> 05:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
we're also limiting this initiative to
 
05:20:17.030 --> 05:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
reimburse those healthcare providers who
 
05:20:18.350 --> 05:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
are trained and approved by the
 
05:20:19.628 --> 05:20:19.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:20:21.530 --> 05:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
which would include professional
 
05:20:21.540 --> 05:20:22.990 align:start position:0%
which would include professional
pediatricians

05:20:22.990 --> 05:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
pediatricians
 
05:20:25.128 --> 05:20:25.138 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire area health
 
05:20:27.410 --> 05:20:27.420 align:start position:0%
education center who I understand
 
05:20:28.910 --> 05:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
already participate in the State
 
05:20:31.490 --> 05:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program this section of the
 
05:20:33.410 --> 05:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
bill is particularly modeled after
 
05:20:35.990 --> 05:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
similar legislation on the books here in
 
05:20:37.190 --> 05:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that leaves the medical
 
05:20:40.550 --> 05:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
experts to do this important work
 
05:20:43.070 --> 05:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
this bill also limits
 
05:20:45.890 --> 05:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
um the initiative only to a screening
 
05:20:48.490 --> 05:20:48.500 align:start position:0%
which is a relatively inexpensive
 
05:20:51.110 --> 05:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
process to have your pupils screened and
 
05:20:52.850 --> 05:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
to identify a larger more serious
 
05:20:55.070 --> 05:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
problem this bill does not include the
 
05:20:57.350 --> 05:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
scope of a more comprehensive more
 
05:20:59.230 --> 05:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
expensive eye exam
 
05:21:02.270 --> 05:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
that is obviously an laudable goal as
 
05:21:04.850 --> 05:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
well but it is not included here in in
 
05:21:07.010 --> 05:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
this bill the thought is that if a
 
05:21:09.650 --> 05:21:09.660 align:start position:0%
student would fail the screening they
 
05:21:11.628 --> 05:21:11.638 align:start position:0%
would be referred for that full eye exam
 
05:21:11.638 --> 05:21:12.470 align:start position:0%
would be referred for that full eye exam
later

05:21:12.470 --> 05:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
later
 
05:21:14.150 --> 05:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
with Healthcare professionals who can
 
05:21:14.160 --> 05:21:15.530 align:start position:0%
with Healthcare professionals who can
follow

05:21:15.530 --> 05:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
follow
 
05:21:19.310 --> 05:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
this bill also limits costs by paying
 
05:21:22.368 --> 05:21:22.378 align:start position:0%
through title 19 Medicaid State Plan
 
05:21:26.868 --> 05:21:26.878 align:start position:0%
amendments to CMS so being fiscally
 
05:21:29.090 --> 05:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
responsible I think that this bill
 
05:21:30.708 --> 05:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
follows along with New Hampshire's
 
05:21:33.470 --> 05:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
strong tradition as being you know
 
05:21:35.868 --> 05:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
very conservative with our dollars and
 
05:21:37.490 --> 05:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
the important thing to know is that this
 
05:21:39.770 --> 05:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
would be Federal funded and we're not
 
05:21:42.770 --> 05:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
looking for State expenditures
 
05:21:45.948 --> 05:21:45.958 align:start position:0%
finally this bill's reporting would be
 
05:21:47.868 --> 05:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
to the state only through a parent's
 
05:21:50.330 --> 05:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
form that they would receive at a
 
05:21:51.650 --> 05:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
screening and then turn over to the
 
05:21:53.390 --> 05:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
local school district
 
05:21:55.730 --> 05:21:55.740 align:start position:0%
exemptions obviously are included for
 
05:21:58.310 --> 05:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
religious reasons or if the child has
 
05:21:59.868 --> 05:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
already received a full comprehensive
 
05:22:02.390 --> 05:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
eye exam within the last 12 months or if
 
05:22:04.190 --> 05:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
they've already received a diagnosis of
 
05:22:07.010 --> 05:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
permanent vision loss
 
05:22:09.288 --> 05:22:09.298 align:start position:0%
so the data will be gathered through the
 
05:22:10.430 --> 05:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the health and human
 
05:22:12.470 --> 05:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
services and then annually reported to
 
05:22:14.208 --> 05:22:14.218 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Service oversight
 
05:22:18.590 --> 05:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
committee under RSA 126-a subsection 13
 
05:22:21.050 --> 05:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
or colon 13 excuse me
 
05:22:22.910 --> 05:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
this is similar to other childhood
 
05:22:24.948 --> 05:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
initiatives data that's reported through
 
05:22:27.050 --> 05:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire systems already
 
05:22:29.750 --> 05:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
so there's no Grand depository no
 
05:22:31.910 --> 05:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
registry we're not talking about some of
 
05:22:33.590 --> 05:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
the privacy concerns that could go along
 
05:22:36.650 --> 05:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
with the larger more comprehensive data
 
05:22:38.868 --> 05:22:38.878 align:start position:0%
tracking device related to the screening
 
05:22:43.070 --> 05:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
that is also not part of this bill
 
05:22:45.110 --> 05:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
um so you know the important thing to
 
05:22:47.570 --> 05:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
know about this is that I have spoken
 
05:22:49.730 --> 05:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
with several stakeholders throughout the
 
05:22:49.740 --> 05:22:50.770 align:start position:0%
with several stakeholders throughout the
state

05:22:50.770 --> 05:22:50.780 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire optometrists
 
05:22:54.410 --> 05:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
Association which I believe their
 
05:22:56.570 --> 05:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
lobbyist is here today
 
05:22:58.910 --> 05:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
um as well as other new hampshire-based
 
05:23:01.010 --> 05:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
optometrists ophthalmologists and
 
05:23:01.020 --> 05:23:02.990 align:start position:0%
optometrists ophthalmologists and
pediatricians

05:23:02.990 --> 05:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
pediatricians
 
05:23:04.910 --> 05:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
actually in fact some of the nation's
 
05:23:07.070 --> 05:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
most leading experts on this issue live
 
05:23:10.190 --> 05:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
in my district in Grafton 12 and I just
 
05:23:12.948 --> 05:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
feel super lucky to have these experts
 
05:23:15.170 --> 05:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
willing to donate their time and talents
 
05:23:17.090 --> 05:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
to advance this cause
 
05:23:19.250 --> 05:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
I think the main takeaways from my
 
05:23:21.530 --> 05:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
meetings with the these groups are that
 
05:23:24.050 --> 05:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
they agree the main goal should be
 
05:23:26.510 --> 05:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
aligned to establish a low cost low-cost
 
05:23:28.128 --> 05:23:28.138 align:start position:0%
vision screening Initiative for our
 
05:23:28.138 --> 05:23:29.448 align:start position:0%
vision screening Initiative for our
state

05:23:29.448 --> 05:23:29.458 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:23:31.850 --> 05:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
you know we've discussed several model
 
05:23:34.368 --> 05:23:34.378 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation throughout you
 
05:23:37.128 --> 05:23:37.138 align:start position:0%
know New England and the Northeast as
 
05:23:39.288 --> 05:23:39.298 align:start position:0%
gold standards that you know may be
 
05:23:39.298 --> 05:23:41.090 align:start position:0%
gold standards that you know may be
replicable

05:23:41.090 --> 05:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
replicable
 
05:23:42.530 --> 05:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire but we were
 
05:23:44.390 --> 05:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
recognize recognizing that the political
 
05:23:46.310 --> 05:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
climate here in New Hampshire is unique
 
05:23:48.230 --> 05:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
and that our model will have to be
 
05:23:49.788 --> 05:23:49.798 align:start position:0%
different than what we've seen in other
 
05:23:49.798 --> 05:23:51.410 align:start position:0%
different than what we've seen in other
places

05:23:51.410 --> 05:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
places
 
05:23:54.530 --> 05:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
so admittedly the goals of the nhoa and
 
05:23:56.030 --> 05:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
the Physicians that I have spoken with
 
05:23:59.448 --> 05:23:59.458 align:start position:0%
are much more robust than the initiative
 
05:24:02.150 --> 05:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
you see here in draft form
 
05:24:04.250 --> 05:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
you know they have three main goals
 
05:24:07.448 --> 05:24:07.458 align:start position:0%
that um I see are missing from this bill
 
05:24:09.890 --> 05:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
that one they'd like to close the gap
 
05:24:11.930 --> 05:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
between a failed screen
 
05:24:14.208 --> 05:24:14.218 align:start position:0%
and the referral and a completed
 
05:24:16.788 --> 05:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
comprehensive eye exam so that missing
 
05:24:19.250 --> 05:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
link is not included in this bill
 
05:24:21.470 --> 05:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
which they would like to see the other
 
05:24:23.090 --> 05:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
thing the second thing is that the group
 
05:24:24.708 --> 05:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
would like to see reimbursement rates
 
05:24:27.470 --> 05:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid increased as well and the
 
05:24:29.390 --> 05:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
third main goal is that the group would
 
05:24:32.810 --> 05:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
like to formalize some sort of database
 
05:24:35.208 --> 05:24:35.218 align:start position:0%
um for tracking those failed screens and
 
05:24:38.030 --> 05:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
how to follow up appropriately
 
05:24:39.948 --> 05:24:39.958 align:start position:0%
um so again that's outside this build
 
05:24:41.810 --> 05:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to keep it simple
 
05:24:44.208 --> 05:24:44.218 align:start position:0%
but the largest arching concern I think
 
05:24:46.490 --> 05:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
that was brought to my attention is if
 
05:24:50.030 --> 05:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
you look on page one line eight and nine
 
05:24:53.448 --> 05:24:53.458 align:start position:0%
as well on page two lines six and seven
 
05:24:55.070 --> 05:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
there is a list of the healthcare
 
05:24:57.368 --> 05:24:57.378 align:start position:0%
professionals that are listed
 
05:25:01.128 --> 05:25:01.138 align:start position:0%
which are required under this law to to
 
05:25:04.250 --> 05:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
complete the screening themselves so the
 
05:25:06.530 --> 05:25:06.540 align:start position:0%
licensed optometrists physician PA or
 
05:25:09.770 --> 05:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
advanced practice RN registered nurse
 
05:25:12.110 --> 05:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that through
 
05:25:14.810 --> 05:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
conversations lay people such as School
 
05:25:17.330 --> 05:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
nurses and other trained groups like The
 
05:25:19.128 --> 05:25:19.138 align:start position:0%
Lions Club can actually administer the
 
05:25:19.138 --> 05:25:20.208 align:start position:0%
Lions Club can actually administer the
screening

05:25:20.208 --> 05:25:20.218 align:start position:0%
screening
 
05:25:22.430 --> 05:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
without requiring more like specially
 
05:25:25.010 --> 05:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
medically trained professionals to
 
05:25:27.170 --> 05:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
to conduct the same screening so the
 
05:25:29.330 --> 05:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be for children who
 
05:25:31.190 --> 05:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
have failed screenings to then be
 
05:25:33.170 --> 05:25:33.180 align:start position:0%
referred to the this subset of groups
 
05:25:35.208 --> 05:25:35.218 align:start position:0%
this optometrist Physicians specially
 
05:25:38.208 --> 05:25:38.218 align:start position:0%
trained medical professionals for that
 
05:25:40.970 --> 05:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
comprehensive eye exam follow-up
 
05:25:43.550 --> 05:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
so um I think that this is an important
 
05:25:45.410 --> 05:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
place for a possible Amendment if the
 
05:25:48.350 --> 05:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
committee is open to that I know we have
 
05:25:50.270 --> 05:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
wording that could be drafted quickly
 
05:25:53.930 --> 05:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
for those two specific line items
 
05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
and I understand that the stakeholders
 
05:25:58.670 --> 05:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
that I've spoken with at the nhoa and
 
05:26:00.310 --> 05:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
other Physicians groups
 
05:26:03.590 --> 05:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
would prefer to amend this bill rather
 
05:26:05.690 --> 05:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
than start with a you know fresh piece
 
05:26:07.090 --> 05:26:07.100 align:start position:0%
of legislation
 
05:26:10.128 --> 05:26:10.138 align:start position:0%
and I hope that the folks you'll hear
 
05:26:11.990 --> 05:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
from after me today will share their
 
05:26:13.550 --> 05:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
personal experiences with their children
 
05:26:13.560 --> 05:26:15.230 align:start position:0%
personal experiences with their children
screening

05:26:15.230 --> 05:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
screening
 
05:26:15.240 --> 05:26:15.910 align:start position:0%
screening
um

05:26:15.910 --> 05:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:18.410 --> 05:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
experiences uh
 
05:26:21.288 --> 05:26:21.298 align:start position:0%
with you today as well So In Sum the
 
05:26:23.810 --> 05:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
bill I think is a solid step for the
 
05:26:26.030 --> 05:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
benefit of kids and vision in our state
 
05:26:28.190 --> 05:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
and I'd just like to say let's not
 
05:26:29.868 --> 05:26:29.878 align:start position:0%
forget that an ounce of prevention can
 
05:26:31.788 --> 05:26:31.798 align:start position:0%
save us significant funds down the road
 
05:26:34.250 --> 05:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
the more kids who are screened referred
 
05:26:36.230 --> 05:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
and diagnosed early means the fewer
 
05:26:39.230 --> 05:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
State resources down the road to assist
 
05:26:40.788 --> 05:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
them in their communities and their
 
05:26:42.770 --> 05:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
school systems
 
05:26:44.570 --> 05:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to request that amendment
 
05:26:46.070 --> 05:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
I spoke about
 
05:26:46.080 --> 05:26:46.788 align:start position:0%
I spoke about
um

05:26:46.788 --> 05:26:46.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:48.770 --> 05:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
so this bill could be considered for
 
05:26:50.570 --> 05:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
ought to pass but if the committee
 
05:26:52.190 --> 05:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
determines that more work is needed to
 
05:26:54.650 --> 05:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
be done I know that nhoa and my
 
05:26:56.510 --> 05:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
constituents would welcome the
 
05:26:58.550 --> 05:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
committee's retention of this bill so
 
05:27:00.948 --> 05:27:00.958 align:start position:0%
that further income input could be taken
 
05:27:04.490 --> 05:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
in a you know more encompassing dialogue
 
05:27:06.770 --> 05:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
could be undertaken to to really make
 
05:27:08.330 --> 05:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
this bill something that we could be
 
05:27:10.610 --> 05:27:10.620 align:start position:0%
proud of here in the state so with that
 
05:27:12.288 --> 05:27:12.298 align:start position:0%
I'll take any questions you might have
 
05:27:15.650 --> 05:27:15.660 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Leon
 
05:27:17.510 --> 05:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:27:20.330 --> 05:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
representative hackham Phillips Phillips
 
05:27:23.030 --> 05:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
for coming and speaking today this is a
 
05:27:24.830 --> 05:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
really important issue and it seems like
 
05:27:27.708 --> 05:27:27.718 align:start position:0%
you got a really really comprehensive
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
big program into just a page and a half
 
05:27:32.090 --> 05:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
which leaves a lot on local school
 
05:27:34.010 --> 05:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
districts possibly a lot to rulemaking
 
05:27:36.590 --> 05:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
Authority I'm glad to hear that you're
 
05:27:38.690 --> 05:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
interested in retaining this because I
 
05:27:40.788 --> 05:27:40.798 align:start position:0%
think that this this is going to require
 
05:27:43.250 --> 05:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
a lot what do you think about offloading
 
05:27:45.230 --> 05:27:45.240 align:start position:0%
this to the local school districts and
 
05:27:47.030 --> 05:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
just the how that's going to cost them a
 
05:27:48.410 --> 05:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
lot of time and personnel as well is
 
05:27:49.850 --> 05:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
that something you would thought of yeah
 
05:27:51.410 --> 05:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon for the
 
05:27:51.420 --> 05:27:52.490 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Leon for the
question

05:27:52.490 --> 05:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:27:55.850 --> 05:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
um so I think the emphasis on returning
 
05:27:57.948 --> 05:27:57.958 align:start position:0%
reporting through the school system is
 
05:28:00.288 --> 05:28:00.298 align:start position:0%
to respect the privacy of our
 
05:28:01.788 --> 05:28:01.798 align:start position:0%
constituents you know when they're
 
05:28:04.628 --> 05:28:04.638 align:start position:0%
getting their children screened
 
05:28:08.690 --> 05:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
to really offload the professional
 
05:28:11.090 --> 05:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
industry from collecting that data which
 
05:28:14.510 --> 05:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
you know May at some point cause you
 
05:28:16.010 --> 05:28:16.020 align:start position:0%
know eyebrows to lift you know of
 
05:28:17.990 --> 05:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
children data being shared from
 
05:28:21.110 --> 05:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
professional offices through a state
 
05:28:23.390 --> 05:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
administrative body so I think you know
 
05:28:25.490 --> 05:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
the common practice as I understand it
 
05:28:26.868 --> 05:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
is that when children enter school now
 
05:28:29.810 --> 05:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
anyway they're also returning some forms
 
05:28:31.788 --> 05:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
about childhood vaccinations for
 
05:28:33.350 --> 05:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
instance so
 
05:28:35.448 --> 05:28:35.458 align:start position:0%
um the model of this legislation is to
 
05:28:37.550 --> 05:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
provide a similar form for the screening
 
05:28:38.930 --> 05:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
to just go through the same system
 
05:28:40.670 --> 05:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's already established through that
 
05:28:40.680 --> 05:28:42.410 align:start position:0%
that's already established through that
initiative

05:28:42.410 --> 05:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
05:28:44.868 --> 05:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
um so I think while there will be some
 
05:28:47.150 --> 05:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
administrative burden for local school
 
05:28:48.410 --> 05:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
districts it's no more than what's
 
05:28:49.788 --> 05:28:49.798 align:start position:0%
already existing in place for the
 
05:28:52.490 --> 05:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccination situation thank
 
05:28:59.390 --> 05:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:02.570 --> 05:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
Sharon thank you for taking my question
 
05:29:06.650 --> 05:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
um if if we were to be concerned as a I
 
05:29:06.660 --> 05:29:07.550 align:start position:0%
um if if we were to be concerned as a I
am

05:29:07.550 --> 05:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
am
 
05:29:10.368 --> 05:29:10.378 align:start position:0%
um about screening and then you
 
05:29:12.708 --> 05:29:12.718 align:start position:0%
understand that your child has a need
 
05:29:14.930 --> 05:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
and you don't have the wherewithal to
 
05:29:17.510 --> 05:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
provide for that need
 
05:29:21.470 --> 05:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
um do you know if there is a similar
 
05:29:23.868 --> 05:29:23.878 align:start position:0%
Medicaid State Plan Amendment available
 
05:29:28.070 --> 05:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
to cover uh the actual
 
05:29:31.430 --> 05:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
um eye examination and then treatment or
 
05:29:33.110 --> 05:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:29:35.570 --> 05:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
or is is screening the only thing that's
 
05:29:37.490 --> 05:29:37.500 align:start position:0%
available at the moment
 
05:29:38.448 --> 05:29:38.458 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:29:40.550 --> 05:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative Weber um so in my
 
05:29:42.470 --> 05:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
discussion with the folks um recently
 
05:29:45.770 --> 05:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
from the nhoa it's my understanding that
 
05:29:47.990 --> 05:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid reimbursements now include
 
05:29:50.208 --> 05:29:50.218 align:start position:0%
coverage of comprehensive eye exams as
 
05:29:51.948 --> 05:29:51.958 align:start position:0%
well as glasses
 
05:29:54.288 --> 05:29:54.298 align:start position:0%
um for those follow-up referrals when
 
05:29:57.708 --> 05:29:57.718 align:start position:0%
made the issue again that we were
 
05:29:59.390 --> 05:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
speaking about is the gap between
 
05:30:02.390 --> 05:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
actually receiving the screening and the
 
05:30:04.250 --> 05:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
need for our follow-up comprehensive
 
05:30:04.260 --> 05:30:05.690 align:start position:0%
need for our follow-up comprehensive
exam

05:30:05.690 --> 05:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
exam
 
05:30:07.970 --> 05:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
um and then getting those people to that
 
05:30:10.310 --> 05:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
place and getting that exam completed I
 
05:30:11.750 --> 05:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
think Medicaid reimbursements already
 
05:30:14.030 --> 05:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
cover the possibility of paying out for
 
05:30:15.610 --> 05:30:15.620 align:start position:0%
the additional
 
05:30:18.948 --> 05:30:18.958 align:start position:0%
exam and glasses follow-up but you know
 
05:30:20.628 --> 05:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
the issues we're just not getting all
 
05:30:22.970 --> 05:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
the steps along the process so this is
 
05:30:26.208 --> 05:30:26.218 align:start position:0%
one my proposed legislation is one way
 
05:30:28.930 --> 05:30:28.940 align:start position:0%
to get the ball moving down the road
 
05:30:32.570 --> 05:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you so as a follow-up
 
05:30:32.580 --> 05:30:34.850 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you so as a follow-up
this

05:30:34.850 --> 05:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:30:37.788 --> 05:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
does this completely close the gap if if
 
05:30:40.010 --> 05:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
we get the screening and a child is
 
05:30:43.070 --> 05:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
identified as needing either glasses
 
05:30:45.550 --> 05:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up treatment of whatever kind
 
05:30:48.170 --> 05:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
if they are Medicaid qualified they then
 
05:30:51.770 --> 05:30:51.780 align:start position:0%
just get that so the issue right now is
 
05:30:53.990 --> 05:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
that they're not being screened because
 
05:30:56.448 --> 05:30:56.458 align:start position:0%
nobody's paying for screening is that
 
05:30:58.610 --> 05:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
the issue so I think or is there another
 
05:31:01.010 --> 05:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
step that I'm missing so representative
 
05:31:03.590 --> 05:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
Weber you have identified the problem
 
05:31:06.110 --> 05:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
um completely it's a multi
 
05:31:06.120 --> 05:31:06.770 align:start position:0%
um completely it's a multi
um

05:31:06.770 --> 05:31:06.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:10.730 --> 05:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
variable concern and multi-step response
 
05:31:15.410 --> 05:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
and so yes we are there is a lag an
 
05:31:17.868 --> 05:31:17.878 align:start position:0%
actual screening numbers so this bill is
 
05:31:19.910 --> 05:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
getting at that concern but there is
 
05:31:22.010 --> 05:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
also a lag between children who are
 
05:31:24.230 --> 05:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
screened and referred for more
 
05:31:25.788 --> 05:31:25.798 align:start position:0%
comprehensive eye exams because they're
 
05:31:28.670 --> 05:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
failing the screening and then making it
 
05:31:30.830 --> 05:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
to that exam and getting a diagnosis so
 
05:31:33.350 --> 05:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's every point along the road you
 
05:31:35.690 --> 05:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
see a fall off so I'm just trying to get
 
05:31:37.610 --> 05:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
more kids pushed into the screening
 
05:31:39.830 --> 05:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
system so that
 
05:31:41.390 --> 05:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
um you know hopefully more parents
 
05:31:44.990 --> 05:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
become aware and you know become engaged
 
05:31:46.970 --> 05:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
with the process of moving down that
 
05:31:50.030 --> 05:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
road to diagnosis and treatment
 
05:31:53.150 --> 05:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
but they're still gonna yes there's
 
05:31:54.770 --> 05:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
short answer is there is the gap okay
 
05:31:58.550 --> 05:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Merchant
 
05:32:01.610 --> 05:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and also thank you
 
05:32:03.288 --> 05:32:03.298 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
05:32:06.530 --> 05:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
this bill as I read it is really
 
05:32:08.990 --> 05:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
targeted to Medicaid children
 
05:32:10.670 --> 05:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think the disease that we're
 
05:32:12.530 --> 05:32:12.540 align:start position:0%
talking about is restricted to them my
 
05:32:14.750 --> 05:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
concern is how do we attack
 
05:32:18.410 --> 05:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
the greater audience because
 
05:32:20.628 --> 05:32:20.638 align:start position:0%
trying to identify children early on
 
05:32:23.390 --> 05:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
with the issue is critical regardless of
 
05:32:25.850 --> 05:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
the payment source so given the fact
 
05:32:29.150 --> 05:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
that most schools have a school nurse
 
05:32:31.550 --> 05:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
who I heard could possibly do this exam
 
05:32:34.430 --> 05:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
it's a basic screening
 
05:32:36.770 --> 05:32:36.780 align:start position:0%
could we not have a kindergarten or even
 
05:32:39.410 --> 05:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
preschool have them perform the exam and
 
05:32:41.030 --> 05:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
then at that point in time identify the
 
05:32:42.770 --> 05:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
children who need to be refer to a
 
05:32:44.570 --> 05:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
professional to do a comprehensive exam
 
05:32:46.368 --> 05:32:46.378 align:start position:0%
and not have to burden the State
 
05:32:48.170 --> 05:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
Medicaid system with the screening
 
05:32:49.730 --> 05:32:49.740 align:start position:0%
process but taking care of what they
 
05:32:51.650 --> 05:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
already take care of
 
05:32:53.810 --> 05:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Merchant for
 
05:32:55.490 --> 05:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
the question I think
 
05:32:58.730 --> 05:32:58.740 align:start position:0%
um yes I think your inclination for a
 
05:33:01.490 --> 05:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
more robust program Falls in line with
 
05:33:03.650 --> 05:33:03.660 align:start position:0%
many of the state's optometrists and
 
05:33:05.150 --> 05:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
ophthalmologists and Physicians
 
05:33:07.670 --> 05:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
pediatricians wishes that you know every
 
05:33:10.368 --> 05:33:10.378 align:start position:0%
kid would be screened coming into every
 
05:33:12.288 --> 05:33:12.298 align:start position:0%
school situation but
 
05:33:12.298 --> 05:33:13.430 align:start position:0%
school situation but
um

05:33:13.430 --> 05:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:15.470 --> 05:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
that's not the scope of this bill
 
05:33:18.770 --> 05:33:18.780 align:start position:0%
because we're trying my
 
05:33:20.750 --> 05:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
the reality that I'm confronted with is
 
05:33:22.128 --> 05:33:22.138 align:start position:0%
that I don't think there's political
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
will in our state to to reach that large
 
05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
of a program at this moment in time
 
05:33:32.208 --> 05:33:32.218 align:start position:0%
um so my targeting of this bill to just
 
05:33:33.530 --> 05:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid
 
05:33:36.770 --> 05:33:36.780 align:start position:0%
group of children it was because
 
05:33:38.448 --> 05:33:38.458 align:start position:0%
I really think that these are the most
 
05:33:41.270 --> 05:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
vulnerable kids in the system and um you
 
05:33:41.280 --> 05:33:42.230 align:start position:0%
vulnerable kids in the system and um you
know

05:33:42.230 --> 05:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:33:44.570 --> 05:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
trying to help them and their families
 
05:33:47.030 --> 05:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
through this process is you know a good
 
05:33:49.550 --> 05:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
place to start but obviously School
 
05:33:51.830 --> 05:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
nurses as you brought up are are totally
 
05:33:53.868 --> 05:33:53.878 align:start position:0%
capable of providing those screening at
 
05:33:57.890 --> 05:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
daycare centers or a young kid K5 type
 
05:34:00.770 --> 05:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
Mr chair constitutions follow-up would
 
05:34:03.730 --> 05:34:03.740 align:start position:0%
you believe my one of my young
 
05:34:06.230 --> 05:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
granddaughters had something comparable
 
05:34:07.670 --> 05:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
to this and was caught by the school
 
05:34:09.410 --> 05:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
nurse through a visiting process we
 
05:34:10.730 --> 05:34:10.740 align:start position:0%
could not understand why she was
 
05:34:13.250 --> 05:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
following behind in her learning because
 
05:34:15.410 --> 05:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
she couldn't see the chalkboard so
 
05:34:17.030 --> 05:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
anyways make I want to say thank you for
 
05:34:18.890 --> 05:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
bringing to our attention that's my
 
05:34:21.470 --> 05:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
would you believe question okay a
 
05:34:23.090 --> 05:34:23.100 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel
 
05:34:25.010 --> 05:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:34:27.350 --> 05:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question I think the critical
 
05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
thing to me personally is points of
 
05:34:32.810 --> 05:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
access here I see three points of Access
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
One is zero to maybe age five which is
 
05:34:37.670 --> 05:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
for you know kids that are in school
 
05:34:39.590 --> 05:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
five and after for kids that are in
 
05:34:41.810 --> 05:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
school and then probably early Child
 
05:34:43.730 --> 05:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
Development programs for kids in the
 
05:34:43.740 --> 05:34:44.690 align:start position:0%
Development programs for kids in the
middle

05:34:44.690 --> 05:34:44.700 align:start position:0%
middle
 
05:34:47.628 --> 05:34:47.638 align:start position:0%
um my question is this I mean it's been
 
05:34:50.810 --> 05:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
40 years since I did Primary Care
 
05:34:52.970 --> 05:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
um but visual screening was part of
 
05:34:55.910 --> 05:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
every well baby check Primary Care visit
 
05:34:58.610 --> 05:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
and what I'm wondering about is are we
 
05:35:00.770 --> 05:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
not already accessing that group if
 
05:35:03.410 --> 05:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
we're not why not
 
05:35:03.420 --> 05:35:04.730 align:start position:0%
we're not why not
um

05:35:04.730 --> 05:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:07.368 --> 05:35:07.378 align:start position:0%
and secondly if I'm seeing a Medicaid
 
05:35:07.378 --> 05:35:08.510 align:start position:0%
and secondly if I'm seeing a Medicaid
kid

05:35:08.510 --> 05:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
kid
 
05:35:10.368 --> 05:35:10.378 align:start position:0%
am I allowed to Bill extra now because
 
05:35:12.230 --> 05:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
you're adding an extra fee to this thing
 
05:35:14.270 --> 05:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
to all baby check
 
05:35:16.490 --> 05:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
oh gosh um I do not have the technical
 
05:35:18.948 --> 05:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
expertise to to give you the answer to
 
05:35:21.170 --> 05:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
the question about a wellness baby check
 
05:35:23.810 --> 05:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
and is there a separate like coding item
 
05:35:25.070 --> 05:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
05:35:26.628 --> 05:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
um related to a potential vision
 
05:35:26.638 --> 05:35:27.830 align:start position:0%
um related to a potential vision
screening

05:35:27.830 --> 05:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
screening
 
05:35:30.890 --> 05:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
um so I apologize I can do some research
 
05:35:32.930 --> 05:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
and get back to you with a follow-up on
 
05:35:34.610 --> 05:35:34.620 align:start position:0%
that representative Nagel
 
05:35:34.620 --> 05:35:35.590 align:start position:0%
that representative Nagel
um

05:35:35.590 --> 05:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:38.810 --> 05:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I want to say it's the first
 
05:35:40.430 --> 05:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
part of your question though
 
05:35:40.440 --> 05:35:41.448 align:start position:0%
part of your question though
um

05:35:41.448 --> 05:35:41.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:43.730 --> 05:35:43.740 align:start position:0%
it was I'm sorry could you please remind
 
05:35:45.410 --> 05:35:45.420 align:start position:0%
me there were the three points of access
 
05:35:47.030 --> 05:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
to care
 
05:35:48.830 --> 05:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
um but school doesn't come until quite a
 
05:35:50.570 --> 05:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
bit later so how do we hit these kids
 
05:35:52.368 --> 05:35:52.378 align:start position:0%
earlier like if we're going to allow
 
05:35:54.350 --> 05:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
personal things my sister was diagnosed
 
05:35:56.628 --> 05:35:56.638 align:start position:0%
with ambly opioid Age Two she had
 
05:35:58.730 --> 05:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
surgery at that age and you know she's
 
05:36:00.770 --> 05:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
got perfect vision because of that um
 
05:36:03.650 --> 05:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
that was she's now 70 years old yeah
 
05:36:06.110 --> 05:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
um well that's a great success story so
 
05:36:08.690 --> 05:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
um to to answer your question
 
05:36:11.530 --> 05:36:11.540 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that um the
 
05:36:14.270 --> 05:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosis can be
 
05:36:14.280 --> 05:36:14.990 align:start position:0%
diagnosis can be
um

05:36:14.990 --> 05:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:17.510 --> 05:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
caught at many various stages of
 
05:36:19.910 --> 05:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
children's development it may
 
05:36:22.910 --> 05:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
um may not be caught at that first
 
05:36:24.350 --> 05:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
wellness check or that you know the
 
05:36:26.448 --> 05:36:26.458 align:start position:0%
two-year-old Wells truck but
 
05:36:28.550 --> 05:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
um but that it could be caught later as
 
05:36:30.708 --> 05:36:30.718 align:start position:0%
well I think that's why the third grade
 
05:36:32.570 --> 05:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
reading level special screening
 
05:36:34.910 --> 05:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
initiative was also thought of because
 
05:36:37.550 --> 05:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
it could be kind of an after
 
05:36:37.560 --> 05:36:40.550 align:start position:0%
it could be kind of an after
um

05:36:40.550 --> 05:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:42.410 --> 05:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
the disorder could be developed later
 
05:36:45.350 --> 05:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
than upon entry of school so I hope that
 
05:36:46.550 --> 05:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
kind of answers the question about the
 
05:36:50.448 --> 05:36:50.458 align:start position:0%
zero to six age group screening access
 
05:36:52.190 --> 05:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I'd like to say
 
05:36:54.470 --> 05:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
to your earlier question is that
 
05:36:56.208 --> 05:36:56.218 align:start position:0%
um you know my understanding is that
 
05:36:57.708 --> 05:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
pediatricians do a lot of these
 
05:36:57.718 --> 05:36:58.970 align:start position:0%
pediatricians do a lot of these
screenings

05:36:58.970 --> 05:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
screenings
 
05:37:01.128 --> 05:37:01.138 align:start position:0%
um in their offices right now as primary
 
05:37:02.510 --> 05:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
care physicians
 
05:37:04.730 --> 05:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
for children and that
 
05:37:06.170 --> 05:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
um you know that is one of the reasons
 
05:37:08.810 --> 05:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
why the language that you see on page
 
05:37:11.810 --> 05:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
one and two in those two lines came up
 
05:37:14.330 --> 05:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
is because actually the first person to
 
05:37:16.850 --> 05:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
bring this subject matter to my
 
05:37:18.530 --> 05:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
attention was a pediatrician here in the
 
05:37:20.208 --> 05:37:20.218 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire who administers a
 
05:37:22.310 --> 05:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
lot of these screenings and has written
 
05:37:22.320 --> 05:37:23.570 align:start position:0%
lot of these screenings and has written
several

05:37:23.570 --> 05:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
several
 
05:37:25.430 --> 05:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
scholarly articles about you know this
 
05:37:27.770 --> 05:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
exact issue so
 
05:37:29.750 --> 05:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
um I think it is the work of Physicians
 
05:37:31.670 --> 05:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
and offices as well as you know the
 
05:37:33.770 --> 05:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
School nurses in our school system so I
 
05:37:36.230 --> 05:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
mean there's plenty points of access of
 
05:37:38.868 --> 05:37:38.878 align:start position:0%
course to to be
 
05:37:41.750 --> 05:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
tapped I would say okay thank you other
 
05:37:41.760 --> 05:37:43.128 align:start position:0%
tapped I would say okay thank you other
questions

05:37:43.128 --> 05:37:43.138 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:37:45.350 --> 05:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
yes yeah thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:37:47.510 --> 05:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so can you
 
05:37:48.890 --> 05:37:48.900 align:start position:0%
explain a little further what you mean
 
05:37:51.050 --> 05:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
by I heard you say it before maybe
 
05:37:52.910 --> 05:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
clarification on there isn't the
 
05:37:54.948 --> 05:37:54.958 align:start position:0%
political will to have this done by
 
05:37:54.958 --> 05:37:56.090 align:start position:0%
political will to have this done by
schools

05:37:56.090 --> 05:37:56.100 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:37:59.150 --> 05:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
what what do you mean by that oh so we
 
05:38:01.788 --> 05:38:01.798 align:start position:0%
are very closely divided
 
05:38:04.368 --> 05:38:04.378 align:start position:0%
uh legislature as you'll note
 
05:38:07.368 --> 05:38:07.378 align:start position:0%
um so I I think um you know to have a
 
05:38:09.288 --> 05:38:09.298 align:start position:0%
very robust system where we're asking
 
05:38:11.868 --> 05:38:11.878 align:start position:0%
every school-aged child to to have a
 
05:38:13.970 --> 05:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
completed screening you know whether
 
05:38:15.410 --> 05:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
regardless if they're going to public
 
05:38:17.150 --> 05:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
school or private school or you know
 
05:38:19.070 --> 05:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
daycare centers
 
05:38:20.990 --> 05:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that there's going to
 
05:38:23.208 --> 05:38:23.218 align:start position:0%
be you know 400 out of 400 state
 
05:38:24.590 --> 05:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
representatives who agree with that
 
05:38:24.600 --> 05:38:26.030 align:start position:0%
representatives who agree with that
program

05:38:26.030 --> 05:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:38:28.430 --> 05:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
um I would love that opportunity I just
 
05:38:31.250 --> 05:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
don't think that's a real ass realistic
 
05:38:33.410 --> 05:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
expectation for our house and then I
 
05:38:34.850 --> 05:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
know the Senate chamber has their own
 
05:38:36.590 --> 05:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
Dynamics so
 
05:38:38.208 --> 05:38:38.218 align:start position:0%
um I just think that
 
05:38:40.010 --> 05:38:40.020 align:start position:0%
that's a term we use in political
 
05:38:41.750 --> 05:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
science political will is the likelihood
 
05:38:44.810 --> 05:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
of a build going from concept into law
 
05:38:47.448 --> 05:38:47.458 align:start position:0%
and you need the you need the motivation
 
05:38:49.368 --> 05:38:49.378 align:start position:0%
behind the idea to get it through the
 
05:38:50.628 --> 05:38:50.638 align:start position:0%
process I
 
05:38:51.948 --> 05:38:51.958 align:start position:0%
by saying I don't believe there's a
 
05:38:53.868 --> 05:38:53.878 align:start position:0%
political will to get it across is what
 
05:38:55.430 --> 05:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to speculate that I don't
 
05:38:57.590 --> 05:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
believe the largest program that will
 
05:38:59.990 --> 05:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
benefit the most kids in our state with
 
05:39:01.670 --> 05:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know the largest Medicare
 
05:39:03.770 --> 05:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates instead of Medicaid
 
05:39:06.110 --> 05:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
you know I don't think that's possible
 
05:39:07.490 --> 05:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
at this time so I'm really trying to
 
05:39:08.990 --> 05:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
limit the scope to something that I
 
05:39:10.610 --> 05:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
think is possible
 
05:39:13.788 --> 05:39:13.798 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
05:39:13.798 --> 05:39:15.170 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
yes

05:39:15.170 --> 05:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:39:16.610 --> 05:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:39:18.288 --> 05:39:18.298 align:start position:0%
taking my question just a quick point of
 
05:39:20.868 --> 05:39:20.878 align:start position:0%
clarification as I as I read the bill I
 
05:39:23.810 --> 05:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
thought for the zero to six that was
 
05:39:26.510 --> 05:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid eligible only but I thought
 
05:39:29.448 --> 05:39:29.458 align:start position:0%
that the screenings upon entry and at
 
05:39:31.250 --> 05:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
the third grade reading level that was
 
05:39:33.890 --> 05:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
everybody not just Medicaid eligible am
 
05:39:35.510 --> 05:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
I reading that writer I think you are
 
05:39:37.490 --> 05:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
reading that right representative thank
 
05:39:37.500 --> 05:39:38.868 align:start position:0%
reading that right representative thank
you

05:39:38.868 --> 05:39:38.878 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:39:41.330 --> 05:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
05:39:43.128 --> 05:39:43.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:39:44.750 --> 05:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:39:46.970 --> 05:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering is this similar to the
 
05:39:50.110 --> 05:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
system that exists or
 
05:39:53.948 --> 05:39:53.958 align:start position:0%
hearing screening for children where
 
05:39:57.050 --> 05:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
newborns are screened and then if they
 
05:39:59.030 --> 05:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
need to they get then diagnosed by
 
05:40:01.430 --> 05:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
someone who's more of a hearing
 
05:40:03.890 --> 05:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
specialist and then they're if they're
 
05:40:07.010 --> 05:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
under three uh put and sort of followed
 
05:40:08.868 --> 05:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
and eligible for services through family
 
05:40:11.750 --> 05:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
centered early supports and services or
 
05:40:13.670 --> 05:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
through the doe if they're you know
 
05:40:15.410 --> 05:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
three to six so I'm just wondering if
 
05:40:17.330 --> 05:40:17.340 align:start position:0%
it's a similar
 
05:40:17.340 --> 05:40:18.110 align:start position:0%
it's a similar
um

05:40:18.110 --> 05:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:20.150 --> 05:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
you know structure that where they
 
05:40:21.708 --> 05:40:21.718 align:start position:0%
because if you screen children if you
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
screen people what are we going to do
 
05:40:24.590 --> 05:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
about all the people who don't follow up
 
05:40:26.570 --> 05:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
is what I'm wondering
 
05:40:28.190 --> 05:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
05:40:28.200 --> 05:40:29.150 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
question

05:40:29.150 --> 05:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:40:31.368 --> 05:40:31.378 align:start position:0%
um to be specific and to point of your
 
05:40:35.330 --> 05:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
question I am not aware of the hearing
 
05:40:37.010 --> 05:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
screening so I can't speak to the
 
05:40:40.010 --> 05:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
similarity of the programs but um what I
 
05:40:42.050 --> 05:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
can tell you is that this legislation is
 
05:40:44.510 --> 05:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
modeled after a best practice out of
 
05:40:46.490 --> 05:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that has a really
 
05:40:46.500 --> 05:40:48.368 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that has a really
comprehensive

05:40:48.368 --> 05:40:48.378 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
05:40:51.230 --> 05:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
much larger program and more robust
 
05:40:53.990 --> 05:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
program than what I'm suggesting for
 
05:40:55.550 --> 05:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
instance they do have the follow-up
 
05:40:57.530 --> 05:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
mechanisms built in
 
05:41:00.350 --> 05:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
um for the comprehensive eye exam
 
05:41:02.090 --> 05:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
referrals and the follow-up that would
 
05:41:03.310 --> 05:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
take place
 
05:41:07.128 --> 05:41:07.138 align:start position:0%
including Data Tracking so um
 
05:41:09.890 --> 05:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
again that is not what I'm proposing but
 
05:41:12.830 --> 05:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
it is this is the first step of that
 
05:41:15.410 --> 05:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
model legislation so that if political
 
05:41:17.990 --> 05:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
will does increase in the future for a
 
05:41:20.930 --> 05:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
more robust program we can build on this
 
05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
starting point and try to
 
05:41:25.128 --> 05:41:25.138 align:start position:0%
you know build that out that
 
05:41:27.110 --> 05:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure out okay thank you other
 
05:41:27.120 --> 05:41:29.270 align:start position:0%
infrastructure out okay thank you other
questions

05:41:29.270 --> 05:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:41:31.070 --> 05:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions
 
05:41:36.050 --> 05:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:38.170 --> 05:41:38.180 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify today is
 
05:41:43.010 --> 05:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:51.890 --> 05:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:53.208 --> 05:41:53.218 align:start position:0%
come to you
 
05:41:55.070 --> 05:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
um with a little bit of an anecdote
 
05:41:55.080 --> 05:41:56.690 align:start position:0%
um with a little bit of an anecdote
regarding

05:41:56.690 --> 05:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
05:41:58.670 --> 05:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
um some services that are provided with
 
05:42:00.288 --> 05:42:00.298 align:start position:0%
regard to early intervention screening
 
05:42:02.628 --> 05:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
within my um the district that I
 
05:42:04.250 --> 05:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
represent both the towns of Amherst and
 
05:42:07.610 --> 05:42:07.620 align:start position:0%
Milford have Lions Clubs and both of
 
05:42:09.410 --> 05:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
them have recently acquired these
 
05:42:12.050 --> 05:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
goggles of sorts that are early vision
 
05:42:14.330 --> 05:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
screening they're quite expensive I had
 
05:42:14.340 --> 05:42:15.590 align:start position:0%
screening they're quite expensive I had
learned

05:42:15.590 --> 05:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
learned
 
05:42:18.230 --> 05:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
um and they're somewhere over uh 800 to
 
05:42:20.628 --> 05:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars per set of goggles
 
05:42:22.430 --> 05:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
um and so through their charitable Works
 
05:42:24.470 --> 05:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
they are having uh breakfast
 
05:42:26.930 --> 05:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
opportunities for these kiddos free of
 
05:42:30.050 --> 05:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
charge to be able to go and sit and have
 
05:42:33.530 --> 05:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh the opportunity to get uh a screen so
 
05:42:36.230 --> 05:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
to speak it is not something that is a
 
05:42:38.990 --> 05:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
definitive medical diagnosis it is
 
05:42:40.550 --> 05:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
something that simply says hey
 
05:42:42.770 --> 05:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
something's not right here we would like
 
05:42:45.230 --> 05:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
to flag for you that you should probably
 
05:42:47.330 --> 05:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
get an additional
 
05:42:48.830 --> 05:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
um doctor's appointment with an
 
05:42:50.770 --> 05:42:50.780 align:start position:0%
optometrist or an ophthalmologist
 
05:42:53.990 --> 05:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's no real um
 
05:42:57.288 --> 05:42:57.298 align:start position:0%
indicator of what the issue might be
 
05:42:57.298 --> 05:42:59.150 align:start position:0%
indicator of what the issue might be
forward

05:42:59.150 --> 05:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
forward
 
05:43:01.730 --> 05:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
we attended one such event when my
 
05:43:03.470 --> 05:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
daughter was really really young she was
 
05:43:05.750 --> 05:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
three years old and um
 
05:43:08.090 --> 05:43:08.100 align:start position:0%
I had initially sent my son up there to
 
05:43:09.708 --> 05:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
have the goggle screening he passed it
 
05:43:12.170 --> 05:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
everything was fine my daughter at three
 
05:43:14.090 --> 05:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
years old sat there and did the goggles
 
05:43:16.788 --> 05:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
and she failed it and it ended up
 
05:43:19.310 --> 05:43:19.320 align:start position:0%
catching a pretty severe astigmatism we
 
05:43:22.070 --> 05:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
had noticed behavior before she was
 
05:43:23.990 --> 05:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
we thought it was toddler related she
 
05:43:25.910 --> 05:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
would trip occasionally depth perception
 
05:43:29.090 --> 05:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
issues were a little bit
 
05:43:31.430 --> 05:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
I would say more pronounced than her
 
05:43:34.010 --> 05:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
brother and it turned out that she in
 
05:43:36.170 --> 05:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
fact has a severe astigmatism that was
 
05:43:40.070 --> 05:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
caught super early on and so while those
 
05:43:42.410 --> 05:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
other organizations that do provide that
 
05:43:45.650 --> 05:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity for such services like this
 
05:43:46.970 --> 05:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
are out there
 
05:43:48.708 --> 05:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
um it they are expensive to acquire and
 
05:43:50.510 --> 05:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
so I think that this Early Intervention
 
05:43:53.270 --> 05:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
Program is also crucial to making sure
 
05:43:54.890 --> 05:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
that those who need the care and the
 
05:43:58.010 --> 05:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
access to the care have it so like you
 
05:43:59.628 --> 05:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
were representative Nagel were
 
05:44:01.850 --> 05:44:01.860 align:start position:0%
mentioning points of Early Access I
 
05:44:03.110 --> 05:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
think are crucial in whether it's
 
05:44:05.150 --> 05:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
through non-profit organizations or
 
05:44:06.830 --> 05:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
through a requirement for continued
 
05:44:09.708 --> 05:44:09.718 align:start position:0%
screening to expand the Medicaid
 
05:44:12.048 --> 05:44:12.058 align:start position:0%

05:44:13.548 --> 05:44:13.558 align:start position:0%

and the final folks signed up to testify
 
05:44:38.150 --> 05:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 580 uh Henry lippman and
 
05:44:39.890 --> 05:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
Rob Barry from the Department of Health
 
05:44:43.490 --> 05:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:44.990 --> 05:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
you've asked for five minutes anything
 
05:44:47.930 --> 05:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
under that would be much appreciated I
 
05:44:49.548 --> 05:44:49.558 align:start position:0%
know there's two of you though
 
05:44:51.708 --> 05:44:51.718 align:start position:0%
I think we could do it in three okay
 
05:44:53.830 --> 05:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you so I think the
 
05:44:56.868 --> 05:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
suggestion to refer this for further
 
05:44:56.878 --> 05:44:58.368 align:start position:0%
suggestion to refer this for further
work

05:44:58.368 --> 05:44:58.378 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:44:58.378 --> 05:44:59.270 align:start position:0%
work
um

05:44:59.270 --> 05:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:01.670 --> 05:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
and to stay within the three-minute time
 
05:45:04.070 --> 05:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
limit there are some issues that related
 
05:45:06.410 --> 05:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
to who can build Medicaid in terms of
 
05:45:07.548 --> 05:45:07.558 align:start position:0%
having to be qualified treatment
 
05:45:09.650 --> 05:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
providers that would need to be sorted
 
05:45:11.510 --> 05:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
out the list that's in there of the
 
05:45:13.310 --> 05:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
professionals licensed by the office
 
05:45:15.170 --> 05:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure would
 
05:45:18.350 --> 05:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
be qualified to bill there's also the
 
05:45:20.448 --> 05:45:20.458 align:start position:0%
school setting that's been discussed we
 
05:45:22.910 --> 05:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
do have a Medicaid school program in the
 
05:45:25.310 --> 05:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
state it's run on an individual District
 
05:45:29.090 --> 05:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
basis I do think that I personally
 
05:45:31.190 --> 05:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
benefited from this issue myself as a
 
05:45:32.690 --> 05:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
kid I was running into walls and my
 
05:45:33.650 --> 05:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
parents trying to figure out what was
 
05:45:34.510 --> 05:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
going on
 
05:45:38.448 --> 05:45:38.458 align:start position:0%
so I you know we would be committed to
 
05:45:40.190 --> 05:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
working with a work group on this to
 
05:45:42.948 --> 05:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
figure out what is the solution or
 
05:45:44.208 --> 05:45:44.218 align:start position:0%
Solutions in New Hampshire because
 
05:45:46.190 --> 05:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
different school districts different
 
05:45:48.590 --> 05:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
communities May based on their resources
 
05:45:50.030 --> 05:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
have to approach it differently but I
 
05:45:53.390 --> 05:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
think the the goal of this legislation
 
05:45:55.788 --> 05:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
is the right and correct goal on the
 
05:45:59.390 --> 05:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
personal experience can support that
 
05:46:01.250 --> 05:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
I have nothing further to add in
 
05:46:03.830 --> 05:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
interest of the of time
 
05:46:06.230 --> 05:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you any questions for
 
05:46:09.650 --> 05:46:09.660 align:start position:0%

05:46:20.448 --> 05:46:20.458 align:start position:0%

05:46:25.128 --> 05:46:25.138 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:47:52.910 --> 05:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
this is a simple Bill albeit a difficult
 
05:47:54.708 --> 05:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
one to understand if you would just to
 
05:47:57.048 --> 05:47:57.058 align:start position:0%
read the text it will increase health
 
05:48:00.230 --> 05:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
care access to a small group of lawfully
 
05:48:03.830 --> 05:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
residing New Hampshire residents
 
05:48:06.830 --> 05:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
in 1996
 
05:48:09.170 --> 05:48:09.180 align:start position:0%
the personal responsibility and work
 
05:48:11.810 --> 05:48:11.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity reconciliation Act was
 
05:48:14.230 --> 05:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
passed the federal act and this was
 
05:48:17.628 --> 05:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
under President Clinton and this was
 
05:48:19.310 --> 05:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
commonly referred to as the welfare
 
05:48:23.510 --> 05:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
reform act and among other things it
 
05:48:23.520 --> 05:48:24.110 align:start position:0%
reform act and among other things it
um

05:48:24.110 --> 05:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:28.090 --> 05:48:28.100 align:start position:0%
created some obstacles to people
 
05:48:31.010 --> 05:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
obtaining Federal benefits so in
 
05:48:35.090 --> 05:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
particular to this bill it it created a
 
05:48:36.948 --> 05:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
five-year waiting period for certain
 
05:48:39.410 --> 05:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
lawfully residing immigrants before they
 
05:48:43.910 --> 05:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:46.368 --> 05:48:46.378 align:start position:0%
that's the bad news the good news is
 
05:48:50.090 --> 05:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
that in 2009 the government created an
 
05:48:52.010 --> 05:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
option for states to eliminate that
 
05:48:53.750 --> 05:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
five-year wait for children and pregnant
 
05:48:56.330 --> 05:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
women who are lawfully residing in the
 
05:48:59.030 --> 05:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
U.S but not yet citizens
 
05:49:01.010 --> 05:49:01.020 align:start position:0%
each of you should have a map in front
 
05:49:02.708 --> 05:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
of you that indicates that New Hampshire
 
05:49:06.230 --> 05:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
is the only state in the Northeast and
 
05:49:08.750 --> 05:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
one of only 15 states for children and
 
05:49:11.208 --> 05:49:11.218 align:start position:0%
17 States for pregnant women
 
05:49:15.110 --> 05:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:17.448 --> 05:49:17.458 align:start position:0%
this bill of pests will require New
 
05:49:20.448 --> 05:49:20.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to amend its Medicaid State
 
05:49:22.548 --> 05:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
plan to provide coverage for otherwise
 
05:49:24.708 --> 05:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
eligible children and pregnant women and
 
05:49:27.110 --> 05:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
when I mean other otherwise eligible it
 
05:49:29.288 --> 05:49:29.298 align:start position:0%
means that they will have to be eligible
 
05:49:33.530 --> 05:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
by income in order to um
 
05:49:35.810 --> 05:49:35.820 align:start position:0%
qualify just like anybody else who gets
 
05:49:35.820 --> 05:49:38.150 align:start position:0%
qualify just like anybody else who gets
Medicaid

05:49:38.150 --> 05:49:38.160 align:start position:0%

05:49:40.250 --> 05:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
along with my testimony in the office
 
05:49:43.250 --> 05:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
the aforementioned map you should also
 
05:49:46.490 --> 05:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
have in front of you that July 20 2010
 
05:49:49.730 --> 05:49:49.740 align:start position:0%

while many categories are included the
 
05:50:02.570 --> 05:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
largest number of affected people will
 
05:50:04.788 --> 05:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
be those who have recently been granted
 
05:50:06.590 --> 05:50:06.600 align:start position:0%

05:50:38.208 --> 05:50:38.218 align:start position:0%
it should be clear that this bill will
 
05:50:40.070 --> 05:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
result in health care coverage for a
 
05:50:42.230 --> 05:50:42.240 align:start position:0%

05:52:08.690 --> 05:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
last year they provided unreimbursed
 
05:52:12.170 --> 05:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
care for approximately 250 children and

at a cost of 150 to 200 thousand dollars
 
05:52:21.708 --> 05:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
and you'll hear from some people who
 
05:52:24.230 --> 05:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
will come and speak also about
 
05:52:24.240 --> 05:52:24.890 align:start position:0%
will come and speak also about
um

05:52:24.890 --> 05:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:27.830 --> 05:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
efforts to re to obtain health care for
 
05:52:29.330 --> 05:52:29.340 align:start position:0%

people who
um

05:52:30.110 --> 05:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:32.750 --> 05:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
would otherwise be eligible
 
05:52:36.350 --> 05:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
um where Health Care Providers had to um
 
05:52:38.270 --> 05:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
were thankfully willing to provide
 
05:52:42.110 --> 05:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:44.030 --> 05:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
while there would be a cost for easing
 
05:52:45.830 --> 05:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and Chip eligibility the
 
05:52:47.390 --> 05:52:47.400 align:start position:0%

immigrant children and pregnant people
 
05:52:53.448 --> 05:52:53.458 align:start position:0%
will send a clear message that we
 
05:52:55.670 --> 05:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
welcome and value newcomers to our state
 
05:52:58.548 --> 05:52:58.558 align:start position:0%
who enrich our communities and add to
 
05:53:00.410 --> 05:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
our Workforce as employees and
 
05:53:00.420 --> 05:53:04.670 align:start position:0%
our Workforce as employees and
entrepreneurs

05:53:04.670 --> 05:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:04.680 --> 05:53:06.708 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:53:06.708 --> 05:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:53:06.718 --> 05:53:07.310 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:53:07.310 --> 05:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:10.670 --> 05:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
I also wanted to point out now and maybe
 
05:53:13.190 --> 05:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
we could save the discussion of this or
 
05:53:14.868 --> 05:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
people could certainly ask questions of
 
05:53:17.330 --> 05:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
this but about this but we can have a
 
05:53:18.948 --> 05:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
discussion about it when we exec this
 
05:53:18.958 --> 05:53:20.208 align:start position:0%
discussion about it when we exec this
bill

05:53:20.208 --> 05:53:20.218 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:53:23.628 --> 05:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
the appropriation in the bill as is
 
05:53:25.128 --> 05:53:25.138 align:start position:0%
written is a hundred and eighteen
 
05:53:27.708 --> 05:53:27.718 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and that is a product
 
05:53:30.170 --> 05:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
of the bill that I
 
05:53:33.250 --> 05:53:33.260 align:start position:0%
had written last year and that we
 
05:53:36.048 --> 05:53:36.058 align:start position:0%
discussed last year and that was when
 
05:53:38.510 --> 05:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
there was only six months left in the
 
05:53:41.750 --> 05:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year in the biennium coming up
 
05:53:43.970 --> 05:53:43.980 align:start position:0%
so because it was so difficult to get
 
05:53:46.430 --> 05:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
changes made through OLS at the very end
 
05:53:49.010 --> 05:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
of the filing period that is not an
 
05:53:51.410 --> 05:53:51.420 align:start position:0%
accurate amount the fiscal note of what
 
05:53:54.048 --> 05:53:54.058 align:start position:0%
it will cost per year
 
05:53:57.590 --> 05:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
which is 224 000 in state funds is
 
05:54:00.110 --> 05:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
accurate but the amount that will be
 
05:54:02.990 --> 05:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
needed for
 
05:54:05.448 --> 05:54:05.458 align:start position:0%
the rest of the biennium which will now
 
05:54:09.610 --> 05:54:09.620 align:start position:0%
be 18 months is I believe
 
05:54:12.288 --> 05:54:12.298 align:start position:0%
336 thousand dollars and I have an
 
05:54:13.610 --> 05:54:13.620 align:start position:0%
amendment that's
 
05:54:15.830 --> 05:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
um written to
 
05:54:15.840 --> 05:54:17.030 align:start position:0%
um written to
um

05:54:17.030 --> 05:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:24.708 --> 05:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:26.270 --> 05:54:26.280 align:start position:0%
and I am certainly willing to take
 
05:54:26.280 --> 05:54:27.590 align:start position:0%
and I am certainly willing to take
questions

05:54:27.590 --> 05:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:54:30.590 --> 05:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative
 
05:54:31.910 --> 05:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
05:54:35.750 --> 05:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:39.890 --> 05:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
lawfully residing is that is that um the
 
05:54:42.288 --> 05:54:42.298 align:start position:0%
criteria that you list in your statement
 
05:54:46.010 --> 05:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
on paragraph five of the is that what
 
05:54:48.470 --> 05:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
lawfully residing means those criteria
 
05:54:50.570 --> 05:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
that are listed in that paragraph you
 
05:54:53.390 --> 05:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
know having a green card or Asylum
 
05:54:55.788 --> 05:54:55.798 align:start position:0%
applicant Etc is that lawfully residing
 
05:54:55.798 --> 05:54:59.208 align:start position:0%
applicant Etc is that lawfully residing
then

05:54:59.208 --> 05:54:59.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:01.548 --> 05:55:01.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question you should
 
05:55:05.628 --> 05:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
have a pack in your packet of things is
 
05:55:09.708 --> 05:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
um CMS guidelines on this option
 
05:55:11.930 --> 05:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
do you do you have that I don't know I
 
05:55:13.490 --> 05:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
haven't read it yet so okay
 
05:55:17.810 --> 05:55:17.820 align:start position:0%
in that in those guidelines it lists a
 
05:55:21.410 --> 05:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
number of categories of
 
05:55:25.128 --> 05:55:25.138 align:start position:0%
immigrants that qualify under lawfully
 
05:55:28.850 --> 05:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
residing I will be honest with you it's
 
05:55:28.860 --> 05:55:29.750 align:start position:0%
residing I will be honest with you it's
um

05:55:29.750 --> 05:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:31.910 --> 05:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
even though I've put a lot of time in
 
05:55:34.010 --> 05:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
this and I found an expert in Los
 
05:55:37.730 --> 05:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
Angeles who knows this up and down it's
 
05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult to understand
 
05:55:40.440 --> 05:55:41.810 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult to understand
um

05:55:41.810 --> 05:55:41.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:44.090 --> 05:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
so two points that I want to make about
 
05:55:48.948 --> 05:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:51.890 --> 05:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
I think we tend to have a very binary
 
05:55:53.868 --> 05:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
view of immigration people are either
 
05:55:57.350 --> 05:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
documented or they're undocumented and
 
05:55:59.810 --> 05:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
that I've learned is not the case at all
 
05:56:02.448 --> 05:56:02.458 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:56:04.910 --> 05:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
Many Many Shades of Gray probably
 
05:56:07.788 --> 05:56:07.798 align:start position:0%
hundreds of Shades of Gray there are a
 
05:56:10.690 --> 05:56:10.700 align:start position:0%
lot of people who are here
 
05:56:13.430 --> 05:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
lawfully residing
 
05:56:16.128 --> 05:56:16.138 align:start position:0%
um who are not citizens who are not
 
05:56:17.930 --> 05:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
permanent residents yet
 
05:56:20.868 --> 05:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
so that that
 
05:56:22.548 --> 05:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
um guidance
 
05:56:25.610 --> 05:56:25.620 align:start position:0%
explains all this and this is the these
 
05:56:27.230 --> 05:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
are the these are the people who would
 
05:56:30.048 --> 05:56:30.058 align:start position:0%
be the biggest beneficiaries in this
 
05:56:30.058 --> 05:56:30.948 align:start position:0%
be the biggest beneficiaries in this
state

05:56:30.948 --> 05:56:30.958 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:56:33.230 --> 05:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
and I would say also about that and
 
05:56:34.788 --> 05:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
maybe somebody from the Department of
 
05:56:36.590 --> 05:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services can respond to
 
05:56:38.270 --> 05:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
this as well
 
05:56:41.510 --> 05:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
that right now people apply for Medicaid
 
05:56:43.850 --> 05:56:43.860 align:start position:0%
and they have to be determined to be
 
05:56:45.590 --> 05:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
eligible or not and obviously the
 
05:56:47.868 --> 05:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
biggest thing is by income
 
05:56:50.150 --> 05:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
but they also have to decide whether the
 
05:56:51.890 --> 05:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
state has to decide whether they're
 
05:56:53.570 --> 05:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
eligible or not
 
05:56:57.048 --> 05:56:57.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:57.058 --> 05:56:58.250 align:start position:0%
 
who

05:56:58.250 --> 05:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:56:58.260 --> 05:57:01.970 align:start position:0%
who
um

05:57:01.970 --> 05:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:06.288 --> 05:57:06.298 align:start position:0%
who has this five-year waiting period so
 
05:57:08.990 --> 05:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
the state through their district offices
 
05:57:11.810 --> 05:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
and maybe with help from the central
 
05:57:13.548 --> 05:57:13.558 align:start position:0%
office already makes these
 
05:57:15.350 --> 05:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
determinations about these various
 
05:57:18.170 --> 05:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
categories of immigrants and what they
 
05:57:20.930 --> 05:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
will have to do is say well
 
05:57:23.930 --> 05:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
now these people are not eligible
 
05:57:25.610 --> 05:57:25.620 align:start position:0%
because they're on this five-year wait
 
05:57:28.850 --> 05:57:28.860 align:start position:0%
and these same people if this law was to
 
05:57:31.010 --> 05:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
be passed and it becomes statute now
 
05:57:33.288 --> 05:57:33.298 align:start position:0%
these people are eligible
 
05:57:35.330 --> 05:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
great thank you I do have that deep in
 
05:57:37.250 --> 05:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
here somewhere
 
05:57:39.110 --> 05:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative Leon
 
05:57:40.610 --> 05:57:40.620 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:57:42.170 --> 05:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro for bringing this
 
05:57:44.930 --> 05:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
back this year my question was about the
 
05:57:46.850 --> 05:57:46.860 align:start position:0%
numbers that you gave from Amazon it
 
05:57:48.170 --> 05:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
sounds like those numbers were pretty
 
05:57:49.610 --> 05:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
close to what you had for the fiscal
 
05:57:51.350 --> 05:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
note we're all was all of that in
 
05:57:53.510 --> 05:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
compensated care related to Legal
 
05:57:55.310 --> 05:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
immigrants or was that from out of a
 
05:57:57.890 --> 05:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
larger issue in the Health Care system
 
05:57:57.900 --> 05:57:59.270 align:start position:0%
larger issue in the Health Care system
yep

05:57:59.270 --> 05:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
yep
 
05:58:01.310 --> 05:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:58:01.320 --> 05:58:02.510 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

05:58:02.510 --> 05:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:04.430 --> 05:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
my wife read this and she said she
 
05:58:05.750 --> 05:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
thought that might be a little confusing
 
05:58:08.990 --> 05:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
so those are those are not apples to
 
05:58:11.330 --> 05:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
apples and oranges to oranges
 
05:58:13.010 --> 05:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
um I think the point of that information
 
05:58:15.048 --> 05:58:15.058 align:start position:0%
from the federally qualified Health
 
05:58:18.110 --> 05:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
Center is just that they give a
 
05:58:20.390 --> 05:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of unreimbursed care
 
05:58:22.430 --> 05:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
to people
 
05:58:24.890 --> 05:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
who for various reasons do not qualify
 
05:58:27.350 --> 05:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
for health care because of um
 
05:58:29.570 --> 05:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
immigration status but they're not
 
05:58:32.810 --> 05:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
necessarily the same people who would be
 
05:58:32.820 --> 05:58:33.590 align:start position:0%
necessarily the same people who would be
um

05:58:33.590 --> 05:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:58:35.750 --> 05:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
whose eligibility would change through
 
05:58:38.628 --> 05:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
this law does that make sense that's
 
05:58:41.270 --> 05:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
very helpful thank you
 
05:58:44.030 --> 05:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
05:58:45.948 --> 05:58:45.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
05:58:45.958 --> 05:58:47.150 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
question

05:58:47.150 --> 05:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:58:50.030 --> 05:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
um so I'm an immigrant myself and just
 
05:58:52.850 --> 05:58:52.860 align:start position:0%
brought in my mother uh several years
 
05:58:54.708 --> 05:58:54.718 align:start position:0%
back and
 
05:58:57.548 --> 05:58:57.558 align:start position:0%
um she in that five-year waiting period
 
05:59:00.650 --> 05:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
was eligible through the HealthCare
 
05:59:04.070 --> 05:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
Marketplace to to have health care and
 
05:59:05.810 --> 05:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
it was based on her income which was
 
05:59:07.490 --> 05:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
nothing because you're not allowed to
 
05:59:09.310 --> 05:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
work in those five years
 
05:59:13.190 --> 05:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
so that monthly Marketplace Healthcare
 
05:59:15.890 --> 05:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
was very very inexpensive for her during
 
05:59:18.110 --> 05:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
those five years so wouldn't that still
 
05:59:20.448 --> 05:59:20.458 align:start position:0%
be the case for
 
05:59:22.250 --> 05:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
um who you are who was mentioned in this
 
05:59:22.260 --> 05:59:24.990 align:start position:0%
um who you are who was mentioned in this
bill

05:59:24.990 --> 05:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:25.000 --> 05:59:26.448 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:59:26.448 --> 05:59:26.458 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:59:29.570 --> 05:59:29.580 align:start position:0%
I am certainly not an immigration lawyer
 
05:59:32.090 --> 05:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
or expert but if I understand you
 
05:59:34.548 --> 05:59:34.558 align:start position:0%
correctly you're saying that they
 
05:59:36.650 --> 05:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
were involved in getting a green card or
 
05:59:38.770 --> 05:59:38.780 align:start position:0%
had already gotten a green card
 
05:59:43.730 --> 05:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
in process of getting process of yes
 
05:59:43.740 --> 05:59:45.110 align:start position:0%
in process of getting process of yes
um

05:59:45.110 --> 05:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:47.390 --> 05:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
and and I have documentation of the
 
05:59:49.910 --> 05:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
paperwork that she provided
 
05:59:53.448 --> 05:59:53.458 align:start position:0%
you know to the marketplace to get that
 
05:59:55.010 --> 05:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
and I know that there is an
 
05:59:57.590 --> 05:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
international institute here in based in
 
06:00:00.470 --> 06:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that I believe dies people
 
06:00:03.770 --> 06:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
you know through that process so does it
 
06:00:05.868 --> 06:00:05.878 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
06:00:08.030 --> 06:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
um you know expanding the Medicaid are
 
06:00:11.448 --> 06:00:11.458 align:start position:0%
are they just not eligible or is is this
 
06:00:12.948 --> 06:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
bill saying they're not eligible for
 
06:00:14.990 --> 06:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
that Marketplace Health Care
 
06:00:17.570 --> 06:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
not the marketplace Healthcare but my
 
06:00:20.030 --> 06:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
06:00:21.708 --> 06:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
um if they had just gotten their green
 
06:00:24.110 --> 06:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
card and of course this only refers to
 
06:00:26.030 --> 06:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
children and pregnant women
 
06:00:29.330 --> 06:00:29.340 align:start position:0%
it's just a sliver of the people in
 
06:00:31.310 --> 06:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
those situations
 
06:00:34.070 --> 06:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
um that if they were children
 
06:00:36.830 --> 06:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
or pregnant women
 
06:00:36.840 --> 06:00:37.788 align:start position:0%
or pregnant women
um

06:00:37.788 --> 06:00:37.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:39.948 --> 06:00:39.958 align:start position:0%
they would have a five-year wait before
 
06:00:42.048 --> 06:00:42.058 align:start position:0%
they would become eligible for Medicaid
 
06:00:43.628 --> 06:00:43.638 align:start position:0%
or chip
 
06:00:46.190 --> 06:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
and if this bill were to pass and there
 
06:00:48.830 --> 06:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
was to be a Medicaid amendment that that
 
06:00:51.530 --> 06:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
would not be the case so I think that
 
06:00:53.208 --> 06:00:53.218 align:start position:0%
it's correct that they could get other
 
06:00:57.410 --> 06:00:57.420 align:start position:0%
insurance through the ACA but not
 
06:01:00.650 --> 06:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:02.570 --> 06:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
okay all set
 
06:01:07.070 --> 06:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:11.150 --> 06:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:12.708 --> 06:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:01:14.690 --> 06:01:14.700 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:01:14.700 --> 06:01:15.530 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

06:01:15.530 --> 06:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:17.930 --> 06:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
so since a lot of states have already
 
06:01:21.948 --> 06:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
done this uh where the five-year waiting
 
06:01:24.730 --> 06:01:24.740 align:start position:0%
period has been removed what kind of
 
06:01:28.128 --> 06:01:28.138 align:start position:0%
evidence do we have of the benefit from
 
06:01:30.770 --> 06:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
either like a health or a health care
 
06:01:33.708 --> 06:01:33.718 align:start position:0%
utilization or you know Improvement in
 
06:01:36.650 --> 06:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
health outcomes or decreased in costs
 
06:01:38.868 --> 06:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
because of not deferring care or all
 
06:01:40.490 --> 06:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
these other reasons that would be the
 
06:01:42.590 --> 06:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
reason you know the usual reasons for
 
06:01:44.510 --> 06:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
why providing people Health Care
 
06:01:47.510 --> 06:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
coverage is a benefit of not just to the
 
06:01:52.610 --> 06:01:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:56.390 --> 06:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
I don't have specific data about how
 
06:01:59.288 --> 06:01:59.298 align:start position:0%
this change in those other states
 
06:02:02.690 --> 06:02:02.700 align:start position:0%
has affected specific Health outcomes or
 
06:02:05.690 --> 06:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
even people accessing accessing health
 
06:02:07.670 --> 06:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
care I'm sure there is that data out
 
06:02:11.448 --> 06:02:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:13.070 --> 06:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:02:16.670 --> 06:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:19.010 --> 06:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
I see no other questions thank you
 
06:02:20.990 --> 06:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative did you fill out a pink
 
06:02:22.910 --> 06:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
card by the way we don't seem to have
 
06:02:24.770 --> 06:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
one for you I collect all the pink cards
 
06:02:26.390 --> 06:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
so I thought I didn't have to I don't
 
06:02:29.270 --> 06:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
know but did you complete one no I will
 
06:02:35.090 --> 06:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:37.730 --> 06:02:37.740 align:start position:0%
okay also signed up to testify today is
 
06:02:43.548 --> 06:02:43.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:45.410 --> 06:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
you have three minutes sir
 
06:02:46.910 --> 06:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I don't think I'll
 
06:02:48.530 --> 06:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
need three minutes I'm one of the
 
06:02:50.270 --> 06:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors on the bill and I appreciate
 
06:02:52.250 --> 06:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
you giving me the time to speak today I
 
06:02:54.288 --> 06:02:54.298 align:start position:0%
just want to reiterate what my friend
 
06:02:56.690 --> 06:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
from Keane said uh about this
 
06:02:58.190 --> 06:02:58.200 align:start position:0%
legislation I think there are a lot of
 
06:02:59.750 --> 06:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
people here in this state who are in a
 
06:03:02.570 --> 06:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
gray area not necessarily documented nor
 
06:03:05.510 --> 06:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
undocumented and those people deserve
 
06:03:08.208 --> 06:03:08.218 align:start position:0%
health care and if we give them that
 
06:03:10.250 --> 06:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
health care we can help prevent
 
06:03:13.910 --> 06:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
greater diseases or injuries that they
 
06:03:16.610 --> 06:03:16.620 align:start position:0%
might get and having them to go having
 
06:03:18.830 --> 06:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
them having to go to the emergency room
 
06:03:21.590 --> 06:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
to which would be an even greater cost
 
06:03:23.208 --> 06:03:23.218 align:start position:0%
to the state if we had just provided
 
06:03:25.850 --> 06:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
this care to prevent those issues in the
 
06:03:28.190 --> 06:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
first place to representative mazer's
 
06:03:31.610 --> 06:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
point I think the marketplace there
 
06:03:32.868 --> 06:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
would be a place for them in the
 
06:03:34.610 --> 06:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
marketplace I think the the problem with
 
06:03:37.190 --> 06:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
it is Medicaid and Chip the services
 
06:03:41.868 --> 06:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
given by the public sector are by many
 
06:03:43.850 --> 06:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
measures significantly better than
 
06:03:45.708 --> 06:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
what's given on the marketplace for
 
06:03:48.470 --> 06:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
lower income folks if you have there's a
 
06:03:50.510 --> 06:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
number of examples and I'm no insurance
 
06:03:52.850 --> 06:03:52.860 align:start position:0%
agent so I won't give out those examples
 
06:03:54.410 --> 06:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
but there are a number of examples of
 
06:03:56.750 --> 06:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
how Medicaid Doles out better Services
 
06:03:59.868 --> 06:03:59.878 align:start position:0%
than the Private Industry can and I
 
06:04:02.150 --> 06:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
think the people who would be eligible
 
06:04:04.548 --> 06:04:04.558 align:start position:0%
based on this bill would be the people
 
06:04:07.910 --> 06:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
who receive those services so I think
 
06:04:10.610 --> 06:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
it's important that we protect them
 
06:04:12.048 --> 06:04:12.058 align:start position:0%
under this legislation and make sure
 
06:04:14.390 --> 06:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
that they're not left to the whims of
 
06:04:16.310 --> 06:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
the marketplace which can itself be a
 
06:04:21.048 --> 06:04:21.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:22.788 --> 06:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
those are the points I wanted to make Mr
 
06:04:24.170 --> 06:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
chairman I think that we have some
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
people in a gray area who need to be
 
06:04:29.090 --> 06:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
covered I think the price that
 
06:04:30.830 --> 06:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro has brought forth
 
06:04:30.840 --> 06:04:31.610 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro has brought forth
is

06:04:31.610 --> 06:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:04:34.070 --> 06:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
well established and would be worthwhile
 
06:04:36.470 --> 06:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
for the state to incur to allow those
 
06:04:38.208 --> 06:04:38.218 align:start position:0%
people to to be covered and make sure
 
06:04:40.010 --> 06:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
that we prevent any other greater costs
 
06:04:42.470 --> 06:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
from happening in the emergency room
 
06:04:44.390 --> 06:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
later on so I thank you for your time
 
06:04:46.610 --> 06:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
and urge the committee to pass this
 
06:04:49.128 --> 06:04:49.138 align:start position:0%
legislation OTP thank you very much take
 
06:04:50.510 --> 06:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
any questions if there are any any
 
06:04:50.520 --> 06:04:53.448 align:start position:0%
any questions if there are any any
questions

06:04:53.448 --> 06:04:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:55.310 --> 06:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
okay saying none thank you thank you Mr
 
06:04:55.320 --> 06:04:57.350 align:start position:0%
okay saying none thank you thank you Mr

okay I'd like to welcome back Henry
 
06:05:00.708 --> 06:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
Lipman and Noah Barry from the
 
06:05:03.470 --> 06:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
06:05:10.368 --> 06:05:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:11.690 --> 06:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again for the record
 
06:05:13.490 --> 06:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
Henry Lipman Medicaid director and we
 
06:05:15.288 --> 06:05:15.298 align:start position:0%
will not take eight minutes
 
06:05:15.298 --> 06:05:16.010 align:start position:0%
will not take eight minutes
um

06:05:16.010 --> 06:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:17.330 --> 06:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
06:05:19.368 --> 06:05:19.378 align:start position:0%
um just trying to fill in a little bit
 
06:05:20.690 --> 06:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
of some of the testimony you've heard
 
06:05:21.708 --> 06:05:21.718 align:start position:0%
from others
 
06:05:24.230 --> 06:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
so I think in terms of the the benefit
 
06:05:27.048 --> 06:05:27.058 align:start position:0%
to the state in terms of offering this
 
06:05:27.058 --> 06:05:27.770 align:start position:0%
to the state in terms of offering this
is

06:05:27.770 --> 06:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:05:29.628 --> 06:05:29.638 align:start position:0%
it begins with the presumption that the
 
06:05:32.990 --> 06:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
person is Medicaid eligible except for
 
06:05:35.750 --> 06:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
the time period the five-year waiting
 
06:05:39.350 --> 06:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
period so if a woman receives prenatal
 
06:05:41.690 --> 06:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
care the child gets well child care
 
06:05:44.330 --> 06:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
visits if they in fact continue to
 
06:05:46.310 --> 06:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
reside in New Hampshire and they're
 
06:05:48.410 --> 06:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
healthy to begin with I think that's the
 
06:05:50.810 --> 06:05:50.820 align:start position:0%
benefit that the Medicaid Program would
 
06:05:53.390 --> 06:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
share from a perspective as to why to do
 
06:05:53.400 --> 06:05:54.410 align:start position:0%
share from a perspective as to why to do
this

06:05:54.410 --> 06:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:05:57.530 --> 06:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
um uh back when this was introduced last
 
06:06:00.048 --> 06:06:00.058 align:start position:0%
year the expert that representative
 
06:06:03.410 --> 06:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
Shapiro who came up with that estimate
 
06:06:06.590 --> 06:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
we also ran it by our actuary and we're
 
06:06:08.330 --> 06:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
pretty close on our numbers so I think
 
06:06:10.970 --> 06:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
the the numbers credible in terms of
 
06:06:13.430 --> 06:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
what's for the uh
 
06:06:15.170 --> 06:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
the updated number as you described it
 
06:06:17.930 --> 06:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro be happy to
 
06:06:19.910 --> 06:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but I think you
 
06:06:20.990 --> 06:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
know trying to stay within the three
 
06:06:23.390 --> 06:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
minutes sure I appreciate that any
 
06:06:24.650 --> 06:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
questions for these gentlemen yes
 
06:06:26.510 --> 06:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
06:06:29.750 --> 06:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
I just had one which is if you
 
06:06:32.510 --> 06:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's a little outside your field but I
 
06:06:33.948 --> 06:06:33.958 align:start position:0%
know you've done work in other places
 
06:06:36.590 --> 06:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
other than our Medicaid Program
 
06:06:39.530 --> 06:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
um is it it is true is it not that if
 
06:06:42.770 --> 06:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
somebody shows up at our emergency room
 
06:06:46.970 --> 06:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
with an urgent medical issue nobody
 
06:06:49.670 --> 06:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
stops and finds out whether they're in a
 
06:06:52.368 --> 06:06:52.378 align:start position:0%
gray area or the five-year look back
 
06:06:57.350 --> 06:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
period they're just treated and then the
 
06:07:00.770 --> 06:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
costs May simply devolve down onto
 
06:07:03.590 --> 06:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care is that correct
 
06:07:05.990 --> 06:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's correct and I just think if
 
06:07:07.670 --> 06:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
you look at what the focus of this bill
 
06:07:10.250 --> 06:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
it's a pregnancy right someone it's
 
06:07:14.510 --> 06:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to happen and the issue is that
 
06:07:16.970 --> 06:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
it's it's not if you will delayable like
 
06:07:18.470 --> 06:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
maybe other chronic conditions and
 
06:07:21.110 --> 06:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
things like that that's I think the the
 
06:07:24.288 --> 06:07:24.298 align:start position:0%
cost to the system are guaranteed to
 
06:07:28.070 --> 06:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
happen and they can be even worse if
 
06:07:29.330 --> 06:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
they don't get the right prenatal care
 
06:07:31.970 --> 06:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
you can end up in a situation where
 
06:07:31.980 --> 06:07:32.990 align:start position:0%
you can end up in a situation where
we're

06:07:32.990 --> 06:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
we're
 
06:07:33.000 --> 06:07:33.708 align:start position:0%
we're
um

06:07:33.708 --> 06:07:33.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:37.610 --> 06:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
you know a neonatal situation and an ICU
 
06:07:39.890 --> 06:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
where you know that they show up at a
 
06:07:42.048 --> 06:07:42.058 align:start position:0%
center that does that because they
 
06:07:43.610 --> 06:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
haven't received the right
 
06:07:46.970 --> 06:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
prenatal care and care all along it's a
 
06:07:48.770 --> 06:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
cost that gets built into the system
 
06:07:51.470 --> 06:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
that we all pay for outside of Medicaid
 
06:07:52.970 --> 06:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
as well
 
06:07:55.850 --> 06:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
06:07:58.010 --> 06:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel thank you Mr
 
06:07:59.330 --> 06:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
06:08:01.670 --> 06:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
question I just simple question do you
 
06:08:03.770 --> 06:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
have any idea what percentage of these
 
06:08:05.570 --> 06:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
people will eventually become citizens
 
06:08:07.190 --> 06:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
of the United States
 
06:08:09.230 --> 06:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
that I don't know
 
06:08:12.350 --> 06:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
um I I would have just focused if you
 
06:08:16.310 --> 06:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:18.170 --> 06:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
sorry other questions
 
06:08:18.180 --> 06:08:19.490 align:start position:0%
sorry other questions
yes

06:08:19.490 --> 06:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:08:20.868 --> 06:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:08:23.448 --> 06:08:23.458 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm hearing this
 
06:08:26.208 --> 06:08:26.218 align:start position:0%
right it's except for the fact that they
 
06:08:28.128 --> 06:08:28.138 align:start position:0%
are here they have to wait five years
 
06:08:31.670 --> 06:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
they are otherwise lawfully you know
 
06:08:35.030 --> 06:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
um citizen or you know um uh present in
 
06:08:37.128 --> 06:08:37.138 align:start position:0%
the United States and they qualify
 
06:08:40.070 --> 06:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise for Medicaid that if they got
 
06:08:42.350 --> 06:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
to that five years or they were not in
 
06:08:44.090 --> 06:08:44.100 align:start position:0%
one of the qualifying categories they
 
06:08:45.830 --> 06:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
would have Medicaid right now is that
 
06:08:49.310 --> 06:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:51.170 --> 06:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:08:55.250 --> 06:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:58.490 --> 06:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
I am seeing none okay thank you
 
06:09:03.470 --> 06:09:03.480 align:start position:0%

from Project home representing project
 
06:09:09.180 --> 06:09:21.770 align:start position:0%
from Project home representing project

06:09:21.770 --> 06:09:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:23.750 --> 06:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman McDonald and members
 
06:09:25.910 --> 06:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee for allowing me to
 
06:09:27.530 --> 06:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
speak to you this afternoon
 
06:09:30.170 --> 06:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
I'm Jane Shapiro from Keene a resident
 
06:09:32.690 --> 06:09:32.700 align:start position:0%
of Cheshire county for over 46 years and
 
06:09:35.868 --> 06:09:35.878 align:start position:0%
I'm here in support of house bill 282.
 
06:09:37.910 --> 06:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
last December the Kaiser Family
 
06:09:42.830 --> 06:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
Foundation reported that in 2021 25 of
 
06:09:44.990 --> 06:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
lawfully present immigrants were
 
06:09:47.628 --> 06:09:47.638 align:start position:0%
uninsured compared to eight percent of
 
06:09:49.548 --> 06:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
citizens and I think representative
 
06:09:51.890 --> 06:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
Shapiro did an excellent and detailed
 
06:09:54.470 --> 06:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
job of explaining what lawfully present
 
06:09:56.090 --> 06:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
immigrants were and the fact that this
 
06:09:58.670 --> 06:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
bill affects only pregnant and pregnant
 
06:10:01.970 --> 06:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
women and children in that category
 
06:10:04.128 --> 06:10:04.138 align:start position:0%
this is because lawfully present
 
06:10:06.530 --> 06:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
immigrants more often work in jobs that
 
06:10:08.868 --> 06:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
do not provide health benefits and
 
06:10:10.730 --> 06:10:10.740 align:start position:0%
because they face eligibility
 
06:10:12.910 --> 06:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions for public coverage
 
06:10:16.010 --> 06:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
including Medicaid chip and Marketplace
 
06:10:18.230 --> 06:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
coverage and I'd like to speak to the
 
06:10:19.910 --> 06:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
question from the representative I'm
 
06:10:23.150 --> 06:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
sorry mazur about Marketplace Insurance
 
06:10:25.128 --> 06:10:25.138 align:start position:0%
because I have personal experience
 
06:10:28.670 --> 06:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
trying to get some lawfully uh present
 
06:10:31.430 --> 06:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
immigrants into that program and they
 
06:10:32.930 --> 06:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
couldn't do it because they didn't have
 
06:10:36.350 --> 06:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
social security numbers and I spent the
 
06:10:38.810 --> 06:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
better part of an afternoon with them in
 
06:10:41.270 --> 06:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
the office of Cheshire Medical Center's
 
06:10:43.548 --> 06:10:43.558 align:start position:0%
designated person who does this every
 
06:10:45.548 --> 06:10:45.558 align:start position:0%
day and enrolls people in that insurance
 
06:10:47.930 --> 06:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
and the reason they didn't have a Social
 
06:10:49.788 --> 06:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
Security number is because they hadn't
 
06:10:52.128 --> 06:10:52.138 align:start position:0%
yet gotten the work authorization and
 
06:10:54.530 --> 06:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
the work authorization took two years
 
06:10:56.868 --> 06:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
and nine months to get even though they
 
06:10:58.490 --> 06:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
had gone through all the documentation
 
06:11:01.548 --> 06:11:01.558 align:start position:0%
and filed all the legal applications for
 
06:11:03.770 --> 06:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
society Asylum with attorneys and
 
06:11:06.110 --> 06:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
according to the letter of the law so
 
06:11:10.310 --> 06:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
there as as representative Shapiro says
 
06:11:12.830 --> 06:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
there are many Shades of Gray and the
 
06:11:14.510 --> 06:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
people that I have worked with fell into
 
06:11:16.128 --> 06:11:16.138 align:start position:0%
a different shade of gray than your
 
06:11:19.910 --> 06:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
mother so I I have concern for them
 
06:11:19.920 --> 06:11:20.810 align:start position:0%
mother so I I have concern for them
um

06:11:20.810 --> 06:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:11:23.868 --> 06:11:23.878 align:start position:0%
since 2016 I have worked with lawfully
 
06:11:26.810 --> 06:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
present asylis in the Keen area through
 
06:11:29.750 --> 06:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
a program called project home New
 
06:11:31.548 --> 06:11:31.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's five-year weight requirement
 
06:11:33.470 --> 06:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid means that our local
 
06:11:36.410 --> 06:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
providers and non-profit medical and
 
06:11:38.810 --> 06:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
dental providers have had to decide
 
06:11:41.030 --> 06:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not they will provide free
 
06:11:43.610 --> 06:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
Care Dental Care is particularly
 
06:11:47.030 --> 06:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
difficult to find fortunately our Health
 
06:11:49.730 --> 06:11:49.740 align:start position:0%
Community stop stepped forward but it's
 
06:11:52.250 --> 06:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
burdensome and there will be a limit to
 
06:11:53.868 --> 06:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
what they can provide
 
06:11:56.090 --> 06:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
let me put a face on those with whom
 
06:11:57.470 --> 06:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
I've worked
 
06:12:00.110 --> 06:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
a family of five who fled with the
 
06:12:01.850 --> 06:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
clothes on their backs as they faced
 
06:12:03.770 --> 06:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
life-threatening violence
 
06:12:05.750 --> 06:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
the parents could not work here this is
 
06:12:07.310 --> 06:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
the the person that I referred to
 
06:12:10.490 --> 06:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
earlier until they received work permits
 
06:12:12.708 --> 06:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
and Social Security numbers and that
 
06:12:15.110 --> 06:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
took two years and nine months the mom
 
06:12:17.150 --> 06:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
is now a housekeeper in a nursing home
 
06:12:19.190 --> 06:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
and they've told me they really want to
 
06:12:20.390 --> 06:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
clone her
 
06:12:22.548 --> 06:12:22.558 align:start position:0%

06:12:25.490 --> 06:12:25.500 align:start position:0%
their children would be eligible for
 
06:12:29.090 --> 06:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
Medicaid if House Bill 282 passes or two
 
06:12:30.770 --> 06:12:30.780 align:start position:0%

High graduates one is thinking of
 
06:12:37.788 --> 06:12:37.798 align:start position:0%

working in her field of choice they
 
06:12:44.208 --> 06:12:44.218 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for Medicaid if House
 
06:12:46.250 --> 06:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
Bill 282 passes
 
06:12:48.410 --> 06:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
or a young mom who arrived with a
 
06:12:50.628 --> 06:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
newborn and two young children who now
 
06:12:52.910 --> 06:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
works full-time at a local company has
 
06:12:55.430 --> 06:12:55.440 align:start position:0%

06:12:57.530 --> 06:12:57.540 align:start position:0%

06:12:59.990 --> 06:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
if House Bill 282 passes
 
06:13:01.910 --> 06:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
or the pregnant mom with two young
 
06:13:04.070 --> 06:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
children who just arrived like two weeks
 
06:13:07.850 --> 06:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
ago if House Bill 282 passes they would
 
06:13:10.368 --> 06:13:10.378 align:start position:0%
qualify for Medicaid after they have
 
06:13:13.128 --> 06:13:13.138 align:start position:0%
been here 180 days instead of five years
 
06:13:14.868 --> 06:13:14.878 align:start position:0%
and if we could start wrapping up please
 
06:13:17.448 --> 06:13:17.458 align:start position:0%
yes these families have been fortunate
 
06:13:19.730 --> 06:13:19.740 align:start position:0%
but many in our state have not because
 
06:13:21.470 --> 06:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
they're fortunate because our community
 
06:13:24.048 --> 06:13:24.058 align:start position:0%
has stepped forward and I urge you to do
 
06:13:26.030 --> 06:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
whatever you can to ensure that we join
 
06:13:28.368 --> 06:13:28.378 align:start position:0%
the other 35 States who have eliminated
 
06:13:30.048 --> 06:13:30.058 align:start position:0%
the five-year wait period and I thank
 
06:13:31.670 --> 06:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
you for your time and the extra time
 
06:13:35.390 --> 06:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions
 
06:13:38.208 --> 06:13:38.218 align:start position:0%
questions from Community yes
 
06:13:40.128 --> 06:13:40.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
06:13:42.530 --> 06:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh just to though
 
06:13:44.510 --> 06:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
clarify on your response to
 
06:13:47.510 --> 06:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative Mazda's comment when I
 
06:13:49.490 --> 06:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
married my wife and brought her over as
 
06:13:52.430 --> 06:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
an immigrant it took me 10 years to get
 
06:13:56.390 --> 06:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
her work papers but she was able to get
 
06:13:59.390 --> 06:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
an immigrant sorry uh
 
06:14:02.448 --> 06:14:02.458 align:start position:0%
an individual taxation number which is
 
06:14:04.390 --> 06:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
equivalent of a social security number
 
06:14:07.310 --> 06:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
except that it does not allow you to
 
06:14:08.990 --> 06:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
work and it was my understanding at
 
06:14:11.390 --> 06:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
least in our case that we were able to
 
06:14:15.288 --> 06:14:15.298 align:start position:0%
do everything with that ITN accepts
 
06:14:17.390 --> 06:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
obviously work because that was that was
 
06:14:20.030 --> 06:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
the condition of her uh Visa so I just
 
06:14:22.610 --> 06:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that a bit thank you
 
06:14:24.590 --> 06:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
for that comment and question I'm No
 
06:14:27.890 --> 06:14:27.900 align:start position:0%
Authority but my I can only say that the
 
06:14:29.448 --> 06:14:29.458 align:start position:0%
people that I have worked with fall
 
06:14:32.448 --> 06:14:32.458 align:start position:0%
within the narrow category of Asylum
 
06:14:35.570 --> 06:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
acai lease Asylum Seekers and so they
 
06:14:37.548 --> 06:14:37.558 align:start position:0%
have they're all different categories
 
06:14:39.650 --> 06:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
and different rules I don't know the
 
06:14:41.750 --> 06:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
category under which your wife you know
 
06:14:44.150 --> 06:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
fell but I do know that my experience
 
06:14:45.770 --> 06:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
and I have talked directly with the
 
06:14:47.628 --> 06:14:47.638 align:start position:0%
Social Security office in Keene and
 
06:14:50.390 --> 06:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
worked very hard on this issue and I can
 
06:14:52.128 --> 06:14:52.138 align:start position:0%
just speak from my experience I don't
 
06:14:53.810 --> 06:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
know all the legal
 
06:14:53.820 --> 06:14:55.490 align:start position:0%
know all the legal
um

06:14:55.490 --> 06:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:14:58.010 --> 06:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
citations that I can answer you more
 
06:14:58.020 --> 06:14:59.750 align:start position:0%
citations that I can answer you more
officially

06:14:59.750 --> 06:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
officially
 
06:15:02.208 --> 06:15:02.218 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
06:15:04.970 --> 06:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead thank you Mr chair
 
06:15:07.670 --> 06:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
um thanks again for taking my question
 
06:15:08.930 --> 06:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:15:11.270 --> 06:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
because you referred uh back to me about
 
06:15:14.810 --> 06:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
that so to kind of answer what you
 
06:15:17.510 --> 06:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned to me about not having uh
 
06:15:19.788 --> 06:15:19.798 align:start position:0%
Social Security didn't have that any of
 
06:15:23.390 --> 06:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
that either so the only thing and so I
 
06:15:25.670 --> 06:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
guess this is a question is
 
06:15:27.770 --> 06:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
um is it not
 
06:15:31.090 --> 06:15:31.100 align:start position:0%
right now permissible to submit an i
 
06:15:33.948 --> 06:15:33.958 align:start position:0%
I-485 which is an application to
 
06:15:35.690 --> 06:15:35.700 align:start position:0%
register permanent residence or adjust
 
06:15:38.990 --> 06:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
status that's all that was needed to for
 
06:15:41.810 --> 06:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
her for us to get health care I can't
 
06:15:44.090 --> 06:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
answer that question I can just say that
 
06:15:46.250 --> 06:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
the person who has given me the
 
06:15:47.930 --> 06:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
information that I just shared with you
 
06:15:50.510 --> 06:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
was the patient representative who does
 
06:15:52.970 --> 06:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
this all the time and she uh she
 
06:15:54.288 --> 06:15:54.298 align:start position:0%
actually got on the phone and called
 
06:15:56.690 --> 06:15:56.700 align:start position:0%
several of her contacts in Concord as we
 
06:15:58.970 --> 06:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
were trying to make this application and
 
06:16:00.948 --> 06:16:00.958 align:start position:0%
the end result was you have everything
 
06:16:03.110 --> 06:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
in place except the social security
 
06:16:05.030 --> 06:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
number and therefore we can't process
 
06:16:06.948 --> 06:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
your application
 
06:16:09.048 --> 06:16:09.058 align:start position:0%
I can't answer it anymore specifically
 
06:16:12.048 --> 06:16:12.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:16.368 --> 06:16:16.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:18.170 --> 06:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
I see no other questions
 
06:16:21.530 --> 06:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair I'd just
 
06:16:23.090 --> 06:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
like to point out that there is a
 
06:16:25.430 --> 06:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
representative who passed in a pink card
 
06:16:27.708 --> 06:16:27.718 align:start position:0%
and who has a little baby who's waiting
 
06:16:30.350 --> 06:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
to testify so I don't they did pass in a
 
06:16:32.150 --> 06:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
punk card
 
06:16:34.190 --> 06:16:34.200 align:start position:0%

um honorable members of the Health and
 
06:17:13.548 --> 06:17:13.558 align:start position:0%
Human Service committee I am here today
 
06:17:17.208 --> 06:17:17.218 align:start position:0%
as a co-sponsor of the bill and just
 
06:17:19.128 --> 06:17:19.138 align:start position:0%
really grateful to rep Shapiro for
 
06:17:21.650 --> 06:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
bringing it forward and I'm here to be
 
06:17:24.048 --> 06:17:24.058 align:start position:0%
in support of it Access to Health Care
 
06:17:26.390 --> 06:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
is a critical need particularly for
 
06:17:29.628 --> 06:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
pregnant people and children prenatal
 
06:17:31.190 --> 06:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
care reduces the risk of pregnancy
 
06:17:33.170 --> 06:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
complications for both the pregnant
 
06:17:36.410 --> 06:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
person and the child both groups suffer
 
06:17:38.090 --> 06:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
the consequences of a lack of Health
 
06:17:40.910 --> 06:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
Care potentially for the rest of their
 
06:17:40.920 --> 06:17:41.810 align:start position:0%
Care potentially for the rest of their
lives

06:17:41.810 --> 06:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
lives
 
06:17:44.810 --> 06:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
currently immigrants some of them wait
 
06:17:46.610 --> 06:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
five years to qualify for the federal
 
06:17:48.530 --> 06:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
benefits that would make Health Care
 
06:17:50.628 --> 06:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
accessible to them and New Hampshire is
 
06:17:52.490 --> 06:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
the only state in the Northeast that has
 
06:17:54.830 --> 06:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
not eliminated this five-year wait
 
06:17:56.750 --> 06:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
access to prenatal care and health care
 
06:17:58.730 --> 06:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
for children is not just an investment
 
06:18:01.310 --> 06:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
in those who receive the care but also
 
06:18:02.868 --> 06:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
an important Public Health investment
 
06:18:04.730 --> 06:18:04.740 align:start position:0%
which will save money through both
 
06:18:07.548 --> 06:18:07.558 align:start position:0%
prevention And Timely diagnosis
 
06:18:09.948 --> 06:18:09.958 align:start position:0%
not only that but making health care
 
06:18:11.390 --> 06:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
more available to folks in our
 
06:18:13.368 --> 06:18:13.378 align:start position:0%
communities will let them know that we
 
06:18:15.470 --> 06:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
welcome them and we value their presence
 
06:18:17.030 --> 06:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
06:18:19.430 --> 06:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
we know that immigrants enrich our
 
06:18:22.070 --> 06:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
communities in many ways and this bill
 
06:18:23.390 --> 06:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
affirms that
 
06:18:25.368 --> 06:18:25.378 align:start position:0%
this bill is not just a health care
 
06:18:27.410 --> 06:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
Justice bill it's also an immigrant
 
06:18:29.570 --> 06:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
Justice Bill Health Care is a human
 
06:18:31.368 --> 06:18:31.378 align:start position:0%
right and everyone deserves to be
 
06:18:33.948 --> 06:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
treated with dignity and respect I urge
 
06:18:35.510 --> 06:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
you to demonstrate your care for
 
06:18:38.030 --> 06:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
children and their parents by voting in
 
06:18:39.948 --> 06:18:39.958 align:start position:0%
favor of this legislation
 
06:18:41.390 --> 06:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
there's one more thing I actually just
 
06:18:42.830 --> 06:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
want to say that wasn't part of my
 
06:18:45.708 --> 06:18:45.718 align:start position:0%
prepared speech I became like a new
 
06:18:48.070 --> 06:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
mother to this one
 
06:18:51.048 --> 06:18:51.058 align:start position:0%
eight weeks ago and
 
06:18:51.058 --> 06:18:52.010 align:start position:0%
eight weeks ago and
um

06:18:52.010 --> 06:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:55.128 --> 06:18:55.138 align:start position:0%
I cannot imagine how difficult it would
 
06:18:57.410 --> 06:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
have been to not have access to care
 
06:18:59.750 --> 06:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
while I was pregnant I got a terrible
 
06:19:01.670 --> 06:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
case of pups
 
06:19:04.810 --> 06:19:04.820 align:start position:0%
I got extremely anemic and needed iron
 
06:19:08.990 --> 06:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
transfusions at our local hospital
 
06:19:13.548 --> 06:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
and then when I had him even though I
 
06:19:15.350 --> 06:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
was healthy and I have a lot of support
 
06:19:19.368 --> 06:19:19.378 align:start position:0%
it's still a challenge I walked in and
 
06:19:22.548 --> 06:19:22.558 align:start position:0%
got sworn in when he was a week old and
 
06:19:24.470 --> 06:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
I could barely walk even though I was
 
06:19:27.890 --> 06:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
smiling you know and you're tired and
 
06:19:31.070 --> 06:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
this isn't the best of circumstances and
 
06:19:36.770 --> 06:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
so I just really want to Advocate that
 
06:19:39.530 --> 06:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
to this is compassion this is empathy
 
06:19:42.830 --> 06:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
and as legislators there's no better way
 
06:19:44.628 --> 06:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
to legislate than from a place of
 
06:19:46.670 --> 06:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
empathy and compassion so I really urge
 
06:19:49.368 --> 06:19:49.378 align:start position:0%
you to pass this thank you so much thank
 
06:19:53.868 --> 06:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:56.390 --> 06:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions okay thank you thank
 
06:19:59.628 --> 06:19:59.638 align:start position:0%

06:20:02.830 --> 06:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just looking at your fellow
 
06:20:05.628 --> 06:20:05.638 align:start position:0%
testifier and wondering how much weight
 
06:20:07.850 --> 06:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
he's gained over those last eight weeks
 
06:20:10.670 --> 06:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
because he's enormous
 
06:20:14.390 --> 06:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
he is um he he is um his dad's a gentle
 
06:20:16.310 --> 06:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
giant um so
 
06:20:18.230 --> 06:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
um a really big man so he must have
 
06:20:20.390 --> 06:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
gotten his jeans he's doubled his weight
 
06:20:24.470 --> 06:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
since um we were here so yeah thank you
 
06:20:26.990 --> 06:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
so much thank you and I apologize for
 
06:20:28.390 --> 06:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
the personal questions
 
06:20:34.670 --> 06:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:37.250 --> 06:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
it we cannot agree upon um we just have
 
06:20:39.350 --> 06:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
to agree to disagree but one thing I
 
06:20:41.208 --> 06:20:41.218 align:start position:0%
think we can all agree on is jordy's
 
06:20:43.250 --> 06:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
pretty cute and um he deserves a little
 
06:20:44.868 --> 06:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
bit of special we can't see his face but
 
06:20:47.448 --> 06:20:47.458 align:start position:0%
we I'm for sure could we get a copy of
 
06:20:50.750 --> 06:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
our written testimony please yes
 
06:20:55.548 --> 06:20:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:55.558 --> 06:20:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:20:57.830 --> 06:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:21:00.048 --> 06:21:00.058 align:start position:0%
also signed up to testify today is
 
06:21:02.030 --> 06:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
Richard Bernard from building community
 
06:21:11.030 --> 06:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:12.830 --> 06:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Richard
 
06:21:14.990 --> 06:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
Menard I'm the executive director of
 
06:21:17.150 --> 06:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
building community in New Hampshire and
 
06:21:19.490 --> 06:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
I should start I suppose by saying I too
 
06:21:22.128 --> 06:21:22.138 align:start position:0%
am not an immigration attorney but I do
 
06:21:24.948 --> 06:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
run a non-profit organization based in
 
06:21:27.548 --> 06:21:27.558 align:start position:0%
Manchester that helps refugees
 
06:21:30.708 --> 06:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
build successful prosperous and healthy
 
06:21:32.570 --> 06:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
lives here in New Hampshire and I'm here
 
06:21:34.970 --> 06:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
to support the bill uh
 
06:21:37.548 --> 06:21:37.558 align:start position:0%
you're all correct that the immigration
 
06:21:40.310 --> 06:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
system is very complicated I get emails
 
06:21:43.190 --> 06:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
like once a week from Boston from The
 
06:21:45.230 --> 06:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
Immigrant national federal office of the
 
06:21:48.590 --> 06:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
immigration service changing various
 
06:21:51.350 --> 06:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
groups statuses they go from temporary
 
06:21:54.590 --> 06:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
protected status to humanitarian parolee
 
06:21:57.170 --> 06:21:57.180 align:start position:0%
and on and on and it's complicated and
 
06:22:00.288 --> 06:22:00.298 align:start position:0%
it's almost impossible to identify
 
06:22:02.390 --> 06:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
particular groups who will have a
 
06:22:04.970 --> 06:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
particular status for a long time
 
06:22:07.610 --> 06:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh I can tell you that we are currently
 
06:22:10.128 --> 06:22:10.138 align:start position:0%
working with people who came a year or
 
06:22:12.650 --> 06:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
so ago from Afghanistan as humanitarian
 
06:22:16.548 --> 06:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
Parolees and now uh people from Ukraine
 
06:22:19.190 --> 06:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
who came as humanitarian Parolees and
 
06:22:22.310 --> 06:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
both of those groups would be in this
 
06:22:24.110 --> 06:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
five-year trap
 
06:22:26.868 --> 06:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
now that this bill is about
 
06:22:29.570 --> 06:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
had congress not specifically authorize
 
06:22:32.048 --> 06:22:32.058 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for them
 
06:22:35.510 --> 06:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't know who the next group of
 
06:22:38.090 --> 06:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
people will be and whether Congress will
 
06:22:41.270 --> 06:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
authorize Medicaid for them it appears
 
06:22:44.948 --> 06:22:44.958 align:start position:0%
that Venezuelans now have access to
 
06:22:49.970 --> 06:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
Asylum and and and all the Privileges of
 
06:22:49.980 --> 06:22:51.070 align:start position:0%
Asylum and and and all the Privileges of
other

06:22:51.070 --> 06:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:22:54.770 --> 06:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
documented legal immigrants in in the
 
06:22:57.230 --> 06:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
United States whether they come to New
 
06:22:59.868 --> 06:22:59.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or not who knows but if they
 
06:23:02.868 --> 06:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
do I hope that the mothers have access
 
06:23:04.910 --> 06:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
to prenatal care
 
06:23:07.310 --> 06:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
and that their children have access to
 
06:23:10.070 --> 06:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid it's important for all the
 
06:23:13.010 --> 06:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
reasons you've heard it saves certainly
 
06:23:14.930 --> 06:23:14.940 align:start position:0%
saves money in the long term and having
 
06:23:18.470 --> 06:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
healthy outcomes from pregnancies uh and
 
06:23:22.250 --> 06:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
and I would only add that for New
 
06:23:22.260 --> 06:23:23.330 align:start position:0%
and I would only add that for New
Hampshire

06:23:23.330 --> 06:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:23:23.340 --> 06:23:25.010 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
having

06:23:25.010 --> 06:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
having
 
06:23:25.020 --> 06:23:26.350 align:start position:0%
having
uh

06:23:26.350 --> 06:23:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:23:29.750 --> 06:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
at a really strong and welcome community
 
06:23:34.490 --> 06:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
of new Americans is enormously valuable
 
06:23:36.530 --> 06:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
much of the work we do is to help
 
06:23:40.070 --> 06:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
refugees find employment and we find
 
06:23:42.890 --> 06:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
employers all over the state clamoring
 
06:23:45.350 --> 06:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
for more people who can come work for
 
06:23:48.590 --> 06:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
them the people we place are great
 
06:23:50.930 --> 06:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
employees many are making eighteen
 
06:23:53.330 --> 06:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
nineteen twenty dollars an hour
 
06:23:55.490 --> 06:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
it's not the system that many people
 
06:23:57.170 --> 06:23:57.180 align:start position:0%
have in their mind when they think about
 
06:23:59.650 --> 06:23:59.660 align:start position:0%
immigration you know
 
06:24:02.690 --> 06:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
trucks pulling up to corners and putting
 
06:24:06.288 --> 06:24:06.298 align:start position:0%
in low day laborers that's not what's
 
06:24:07.970 --> 06:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire
 
06:24:10.548 --> 06:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
people are here they're living they're
 
06:24:12.830 --> 06:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
working really hard and they're in
 
06:24:16.190 --> 06:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
important jobs in in manufacturing and
 
06:24:18.310 --> 06:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
health care and everywhere else
 
06:24:21.708 --> 06:24:21.718 align:start position:0%
and the need is great for more frankly
 
06:24:24.170 --> 06:24:24.180 align:start position:0%
for our economy our well-being and the
 
06:24:27.410 --> 06:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
to reduce that aging population that we
 
06:24:30.350 --> 06:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
all worry about so I think this bill is
 
06:24:32.448 --> 06:24:32.458 align:start position:0%
a is a step in the right direction for
 
06:24:35.330 --> 06:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
creating a vibrant diverse community and
 
06:24:36.830 --> 06:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
I think the the representative for
 
06:24:38.810 --> 06:24:38.820 align:start position:0%
introducing it thank you I'm happy to
 
06:24:40.548 --> 06:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you questions
 
06:24:44.110 --> 06:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:46.788 --> 06:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
06:24:48.230 --> 06:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you to catch you at
 
06:24:49.910 --> 06:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
the last moment um do you think that if
 
06:24:51.708 --> 06:24:51.718 align:start position:0%
we do this this would actually be a draw
 
06:24:54.048 --> 06:24:54.058 align:start position:0%
that would have more immigrants moving
 
06:24:56.990 --> 06:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire exactly I doubt people
 
06:24:59.690 --> 06:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
will know enough about the state's
 
06:25:02.810 --> 06:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
peculiar laws to come here because of it
 
06:25:05.270 --> 06:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
but they might stay if they're here
 
06:25:09.170 --> 06:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
because of it you know people leave
 
06:25:12.410 --> 06:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
we just one an Afghan man who was uh
 
06:25:16.368 --> 06:25:16.378 align:start position:0%
working uh at pitco just left for
 
06:25:18.350 --> 06:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
California mostly because of family
 
06:25:18.360 --> 06:25:20.230 align:start position:0%
California mostly because of family
reunification

06:25:20.230 --> 06:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
reunification
 
06:25:22.670 --> 06:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
this is actually a pretty difficult
 
06:25:25.970 --> 06:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
state to live in if you're low income
 
06:25:28.070 --> 06:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
and people leave virtually all of the
 
06:25:30.890 --> 06:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
rohingya refugees have left Nashua for
 
06:25:34.730 --> 06:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
example many of the most half of the
 
06:25:36.470 --> 06:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
bhutanese have left conquered in
 
06:25:36.480 --> 06:25:37.990 align:start position:0%
bhutanese have left conquered in
Manchester

06:25:37.990 --> 06:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
06:25:40.610 --> 06:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
and and I think that's a real loss to
 
06:25:43.310 --> 06:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
the state having having a bill like this
 
06:25:46.430 --> 06:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
is a way to say you know we value you
 
06:25:48.470 --> 06:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
here we want to make sure you're well
 
06:25:51.708 --> 06:25:51.718 align:start position:0%
and healthy and hope you stay
 
06:25:53.810 --> 06:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
06:25:56.270 --> 06:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
I've yes
 
06:25:57.890 --> 06:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
yes great
 
06:25:59.868 --> 06:25:59.878 align:start position:0%
yeah and I just want to clarify because
 
06:26:01.730 --> 06:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
I mean I think immigrants when they come
 
06:26:04.250 --> 06:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
in should have options and it was a
 
06:26:05.930 --> 06:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
little bit concerning to me to hear
 
06:26:08.510 --> 06:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
testimony maybe those people on the low
 
06:26:11.208 --> 06:26:11.218 align:start position:0%
end maybe their the Medicaid options the
 
06:26:12.890 --> 06:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
root for them but for those that have
 
06:26:16.090 --> 06:26:16.100 align:start position:0%
maybe a bit more means to find out that
 
06:26:20.270 --> 06:26:20.280 align:start position:0%
the exchange is not an option
 
06:26:23.448 --> 06:26:23.458 align:start position:0%
um has that been your experience as well
 
06:26:23.458 --> 06:26:25.670 align:start position:0%
um has that been your experience as well
yeah

06:26:25.670 --> 06:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:26:28.670 --> 06:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
um I well what can I say um The Exchange
 
06:26:30.410 --> 06:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
is really important
 
06:26:33.170 --> 06:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
for most people their first recourse is
 
06:26:35.690 --> 06:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
Medicaid for most of the refugees that
 
06:26:38.868 --> 06:26:38.878 align:start position:0%
we see they start with Medicaid and
 
06:26:40.548 --> 06:26:40.558 align:start position:0%
you're right as they get more settled
 
06:26:42.770 --> 06:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
here and get more sophisticated about
 
06:26:46.250 --> 06:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
how how the system works many do choose
 
06:26:49.128 --> 06:26:49.138 align:start position:0%
to purchase their own insurance or they
 
06:26:51.670 --> 06:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
may get it from from their employer
 
06:26:55.128 --> 06:26:55.138 align:start position:0%
so Medicaid is not the only option but
 
06:26:56.868 --> 06:26:56.878 align:start position:0%
it's it's certainly important for all
 
06:27:00.368 --> 06:27:00.378 align:start position:0%
the all the reasons that we have it
 
06:27:03.590 --> 06:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
06:27:05.330 --> 06:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering about a point of
 
06:27:07.250 --> 06:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
clarification because it seems to me
 
06:27:09.590 --> 06:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
like we're getting into comparing apples
 
06:27:12.170 --> 06:27:12.180 align:start position:0%
and oranges territory here
 
06:27:12.180 --> 06:27:13.850 align:start position:0%
and oranges territory here
um

06:27:13.850 --> 06:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:15.890 --> 06:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
if you know and if you may not be the
 
06:27:17.390 --> 06:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
right person to ask and if not I'll go
 
06:27:20.390 --> 06:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
and Bug somebody else later but
 
06:27:20.400 --> 06:27:21.070 align:start position:0%
and Bug somebody else later but
um

06:27:21.070 --> 06:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:27:23.530 --> 06:27:23.540 align:start position:0%
isn't this bill
 
06:27:28.128 --> 06:27:28.138 align:start position:0%
aimed at Asylum Seekers who are in the
 
06:27:30.350 --> 06:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
category of people who
 
06:27:32.448 --> 06:27:32.458 align:start position:0%
may not work
 
06:27:37.810 --> 06:27:37.820 align:start position:0%
because their status has not yet been
 
06:27:40.670 --> 06:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
regularized to the point where they may
 
06:27:44.750 --> 06:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
work as opposed to the people that I
 
06:27:49.030 --> 06:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
heard you speak of who are working and
 
06:27:52.970 --> 06:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
therefore have more options available to
 
06:27:56.150 --> 06:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
them than those who are not allowed to
 
06:27:56.160 --> 06:27:57.530 align:start position:0%
them than those who are not allowed to
work

06:27:57.530 --> 06:27:57.540 align:start position:0%
work
 
06:27:59.810 --> 06:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and also for
 
06:28:03.170 --> 06:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
giving me an opt out my understanding is
 
06:28:06.350 --> 06:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
that there that that the bill is open to
 
06:28:09.890 --> 06:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
other people than Asylum Seekers and and
 
06:28:12.170 --> 06:28:12.180 align:start position:0%
I'll let representative Shapiro explain
 
06:28:15.830 --> 06:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
his research more fully okay but there
 
06:28:17.930 --> 06:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
are people here who can work who are
 
06:28:21.350 --> 06:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
Legally Legally Legally residing who are
 
06:28:23.930 --> 06:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
not refugees with all the benefits that
 
06:28:26.150 --> 06:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
come with that official status
 
06:28:28.310 --> 06:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh and who also may not be seeking
 
06:28:28.320 --> 06:28:30.948 align:start position:0%
uh and who also may not be seeking

06:33:06.288 --> 06:33:06.298 align:start position:0%
well this is a quick one
 
06:33:11.448 --> 06:33:11.458 align:start position:0%

of new Futures I'll try and keep this
 
06:33:40.730 --> 06:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
brief Bob done as a tough act to follow
 
06:33:42.708 --> 06:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
as many of you know new Futures is a
 
06:33:44.750 --> 06:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan non-profit Health policy and
 
06:33:46.970 --> 06:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization as new Futures
 
06:33:48.948 --> 06:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
authorize kids count organization we
 
06:33:50.750 --> 06:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
advocate for data driven policies that
 
06:33:52.128 --> 06:33:52.138 align:start position:0%
support Granite State Children and
 
06:33:52.138 --> 06:33:53.170 align:start position:0%
support Granite State Children and
Families

06:33:53.170 --> 06:33:53.180 align:start position:0%
Families
 
06:33:55.150 --> 06:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
as we've heard throughout this afternoon
 
06:33:57.470 --> 06:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
legally residing immigrant families
 
06:33:59.030 --> 06:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
often don't have access to the health
 
06:34:01.190 --> 06:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
care they need because they're forced to
 
06:34:02.990 --> 06:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
wait this five years to access Medicaid
 
06:34:05.390 --> 06:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
and ship they're forced to rely on the
 
06:34:07.670 --> 06:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
marketplace or other high cost insurance
 
06:34:09.410 --> 06:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
Alternatives or to forego insurance
 
06:34:11.868 --> 06:34:11.878 align:start position:0%
coverage entirely this negatively
 
06:34:14.030 --> 06:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
impacts not just their current access to
 
06:34:16.250 --> 06:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
needed health care but it can contribute
 
06:34:17.868 --> 06:34:17.878 align:start position:0%
to higher poverty levels and other
 
06:34:20.448 --> 06:34:20.458 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences which are
 
06:34:22.490 --> 06:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
known to impair children's brain
 
06:34:23.990 --> 06:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
development and lead to negative Health
 
06:34:26.390 --> 06:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
outcomes throughout the lifetime further
 
06:34:28.190 --> 06:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
as representative Weber noted earlier
 
06:34:30.048 --> 06:34:30.058 align:start position:0%
health care costs incurred by these
 
06:34:32.270 --> 06:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
individuals can lead to higher rates of
 
06:34:34.910 --> 06:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care which can put added
 
06:34:36.288 --> 06:34:36.298 align:start position:0%
pressure across our Health Care system
 
06:34:38.030 --> 06:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
and lead to higher premiums across the
 
06:34:41.628 --> 06:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
board so investing these children and
 
06:34:43.190 --> 06:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
families by eliminating The Five-Year
 
06:34:44.810 --> 06:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
weight as proposed in this bill would
 
06:34:46.310 --> 06:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
improve the physical and Financial
 
06:34:48.048 --> 06:34:48.058 align:start position:0%
Health of these families and our state
 
06:34:49.730 --> 06:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
as a whole and we ask you to vote this
 
06:34:51.110 --> 06:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
bill out to pass and I'm happy to take
 
06:34:51.120 --> 06:34:52.070 align:start position:0%
bill out to pass and I'm happy to take
questions

06:34:52.070 --> 06:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:34:55.430 --> 06:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you questions
 
06:34:58.448 --> 06:34:58.458 align:start position:0%
any questions for this gentleman
 
06:35:00.948 --> 06:35:00.958 align:start position:0%
representative Leon thank you Mr
 
06:35:02.690 --> 06:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
06:35:04.910 --> 06:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
and speaking to the exchange you spoke
 
06:35:06.770 --> 06:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
to the price point but have you seen any
 
06:35:08.810 --> 06:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
problems with people accessing the
 
06:35:10.430 --> 06:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
exchange or has that been an option for
 
06:35:12.048 --> 06:35:12.058 align:start position:0%
this community
 
06:35:15.470 --> 06:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
I you know I I we don't work as directly
 
06:35:16.850 --> 06:35:16.860 align:start position:0%
in this community as others here so I'm
 
06:35:18.170 --> 06:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
not sure I can speak to that certainly
 
06:35:19.548 --> 06:35:19.558 align:start position:0%
you know we are always concerned about
 
06:35:21.590 --> 06:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
individuals uh who are not able to
 
06:35:23.930 --> 06:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
access uh public health insurance or
 
06:35:25.310 --> 06:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
employer-based health insurance and
 
06:35:26.810 --> 06:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
their ability to access the exchange
 
06:35:28.850 --> 06:35:28.860 align:start position:0%
both due to um price points and just the
 
06:35:31.610 --> 06:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
overall um complexity of the system
 
06:35:33.170 --> 06:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
um so you know we think that the uh you
 
06:35:34.730 --> 06:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
know a public option like this is really
 
06:35:36.830 --> 06:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh critical in terms especially for
 
06:35:38.810 --> 06:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
individuals like this who are new to the
 
06:35:40.788 --> 06:35:40.798 align:start position:0%
United States and new to the system
 
06:35:42.948 --> 06:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
um offering this uh you know medicator
 
06:35:44.628 --> 06:35:44.638 align:start position:0%
chip as sort of First Step health
 
06:35:48.230 --> 06:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
coverage is really important thank you
 
06:35:51.830 --> 06:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:53.510 --> 06:35:53.520 align:start position:0%

06:37:00.110 --> 06:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Sandra nakanter a

Nigerian immigrant married with three
 
06:37:04.490 --> 06:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
children two boys and a girl
 
06:37:08.208 --> 06:37:08.218 align:start position:0%
I am writing to support HP 282 which
 
06:37:09.948 --> 06:37:09.958 align:start position:0%
will allow pregnant immigrants and
 
06:37:12.230 --> 06:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
minors to get health care
 
06:37:15.708 --> 06:37:15.718 align:start position:0%
when I became pregnant in August of 2017
 
06:37:19.368 --> 06:37:19.378 align:start position:0%
I was living in Dallas Texas
 
06:37:22.190 --> 06:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
I was able to apply for a type of
 
06:37:24.470 --> 06:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
medical insurance through the state
 
06:37:27.048 --> 06:37:27.058 align:start position:0%
which is called Medicaid
 
06:37:28.970 --> 06:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
it's like Medicaid
 
06:37:31.850 --> 06:37:31.860 align:start position:0%
they that insurance covered both my
 
06:37:35.150 --> 06:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
unborn child and me and included
 
06:37:38.448 --> 06:37:38.458 align:start position:0%
postnatal visits as well
 
06:37:41.208 --> 06:37:41.218 align:start position:0%
I was so relieved because I didn't have
 
06:37:43.310 --> 06:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
to come up with six thousand dollars or
 
06:37:46.310 --> 06:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
more for hospital bills
 
06:37:49.548 --> 06:37:49.558 align:start position:0%
in November of that same year however my
 
06:37:51.048 --> 06:37:51.058 align:start position:0%
husband was placed in immigrant
 
06:37:53.690 --> 06:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
detention and transferred to Stratford
 
06:37:56.868 --> 06:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
County Jail which is here in Dover New
 
06:37:56.878 --> 06:37:58.128 align:start position:0%
County Jail which is here in Dover New
Hampshire

06:37:58.128 --> 06:37:58.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:38:00.708 --> 06:38:00.718 align:start position:0%
that meant that my two boys and I needed
 
06:38:03.948 --> 06:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
to come to live in New Hampshire
 
06:38:06.770 --> 06:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
before we could make a decision to come
 
06:38:09.350 --> 06:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
The Immigrant and refugee before we
 
06:38:11.330 --> 06:38:11.340 align:start position:0%
could make a decision to come
 
06:38:13.190 --> 06:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
The Immigrant and Refugee support group
 
06:38:14.690 --> 06:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
at the New Hampshire Conference United
 
06:38:17.208 --> 06:38:17.218 align:start position:0%
Church of Christ had to look for an
 
06:38:19.548 --> 06:38:19.558 align:start position:0%
obstetrician that was willing to take
 
06:38:21.948 --> 06:38:21.958 align:start position:0%
care of me and help me with the delivery
 
06:38:21.958 --> 06:38:23.510 align:start position:0%
care of me and help me with the delivery
process

06:38:23.510 --> 06:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:38:27.890 --> 06:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
fortunately the group found Dr Perkins
 
06:38:30.048 --> 06:38:30.058 align:start position:0%
Garrison Women's Health offered to
 
06:38:32.330 --> 06:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
donate their services for my prenatal
 
06:38:34.970 --> 06:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
and postnatal care because the state of
 
06:38:36.890 --> 06:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does not have any program
 
06:38:40.070 --> 06:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
that covers pregnant immigrants
 
06:38:42.970 --> 06:38:42.980 align:start position:0%
my boys who were three and nearly five
 
06:38:46.010 --> 06:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
then couldn't get any medical insurance
 
06:38:49.070 --> 06:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
through the state either
 
06:38:51.410 --> 06:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
I'm very grateful for the help offered
 
06:38:53.750 --> 06:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
to me and my family by The Immigrant
 
06:38:55.610 --> 06:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
Refugee support group and Garrison
 
06:38:57.350 --> 06:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
Women's Health
 
06:38:59.868 --> 06:38:59.878 align:start position:0%
I recently learned that the reason they
 
06:39:02.628 --> 06:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
needed to help me was that the state of
 
06:39:05.030 --> 06:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hasn't opted in to the
 
06:39:07.190 --> 06:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
same Federal program that was available
 
06:39:10.610 --> 06:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:14.330 --> 06:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
my family was recently granted Asylum
 
06:39:16.788 --> 06:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
during the week I earned my
 
06:39:19.010 --> 06:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
certification to be a licensed nursing
 
06:39:19.020 --> 06:39:20.330 align:start position:0%
certification to be a licensed nursing
assistant

06:39:20.330 --> 06:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
06:39:23.090 --> 06:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
now I work as an LNA because I love
 
06:39:24.530 --> 06:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
helping people
 
06:39:27.350 --> 06:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
I work in a nursing home and sing for my
 
06:39:29.690 --> 06:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
patients to make them happy
 
06:39:32.330 --> 06:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
I'm also taking classes at Great Bay so
 
06:39:34.788 --> 06:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
I can become a registered nurse probably
 
06:39:37.430 --> 06:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
in three years time
 
06:39:39.350 --> 06:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
I hope that the state of New Hampshire
 
06:39:41.810 --> 06:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
will opt into the federal program
 
06:39:44.628 --> 06:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
more immigrant health workers like me
 
06:39:47.208 --> 06:39:47.218 align:start position:0%
are needed in New Hampshire and having
