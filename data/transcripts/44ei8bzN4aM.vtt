allergy awareness procedures I think
 
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
this is an easy one they did implement
 
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
the rules does anybody here from the
 
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.629 align:start position:0%

yeah come up and tell us how it's all
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
going and why we really don't need this
 
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
now for the record my name is Abby

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health Services
 
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
um I know Colleen Smith is usually here
 
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
to talk about food issues but I've got
 
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
information on this so I'd be happy to
 
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
provide it
 
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
um in relation to HP 65 the updated food
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
rules which are Hep 2300 which would
 
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
include the allergen notice to be posted
 
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
on menu and menu boards uh which was
 
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
effective uh first week of August 2022
 
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
so those are in effect food protection
 
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
program at the department did an email
 
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
blast to all of the establishments
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
making them aware of the changes
 
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 align:start position:0%
um and we started enforcement on that in
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
September 1st of 2022. so we also
 
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
discussed the rule changes with the
 
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
self-inspecting towns and encourage them
 
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
to adopt their requirements as well so
 
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
that's the update I have on that great
 
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anybody have any
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
questions yeah
 
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
I think that's great
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
um could you tell us what the department
 
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
is doing in terms of uh informing the
 
00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
public that this is or are you doing
 
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
anything right I'm sorry uh I think that
 
00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 align:start position:0%
we are you know me talking about this
 
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
new rule change
 
00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 align:start position:0%
um as making restaurant owners aware
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
certainly um talking to establishments
 
00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
our inspectors that are involved with
 
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
restaurants or making them aware of this
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
change so as far as further public
 
00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 align:start position:0%
Outreach I can get back to you on that
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
but that's what I'm aware of today what
 
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
we're working on thank you for the
 
00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 align:start position:0%
question representative Bartlett thanks
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 align:start position:0%
um welcome back thank you thank you
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
certainly seen you before Ms Rogers
 
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.370 align:start position:0%
certainly seen you before Ms Rogers
um

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
would you be just refresh our memory
 
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
because this was
 
00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 align:start position:0%
not this term but
 
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
um year before would you refresh our
 
00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
memories on what the allergens are that
 
00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
will be shown on the on the menus
 
00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
sure uh generally I believe that the
 
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
allergens that um are involved with this
 
00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 align:start position:0%
bill are you know specific to food
 
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
allergies so tree nuts
 
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
um soy Dairy
 
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.950 align:start position:0%
um soy Dairy
um

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:12.419 align:start position:0%
I believe fish
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
um and those are the ones that I'm aware
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
of I certainly can get you a more
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
comprehensive list but it's generally
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
all the food allergens that are
 
00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
recognized by a medical provider would
 
00:07:22.129 --> 00:07:22.139 align:start position:0%
you be able to send us an email list
 
00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
just to the committee sure
 
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
I just came back from Ireland and I got
 
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
to tell you you can go in any Pub any
 
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
restaurant any hotel
 
00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
and every single menu has the
 
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
information they just have a little
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
little asterisk or a little code after
 
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.290 align:start position:0%
little asterisk or a little code after
each

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
each
 
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
menu Choice
 
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
um with what the allergens are it was
 
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
very simple great no I'd be happy to do
 
00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
that I didn't that's what we're doing
 
00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
that's great sure I didn't include
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
gluten which I'm sure is on that as well
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
yeah I will get you a comprehensible
 
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.170 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.990 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
yes generally
 
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
um does this include
 
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.490 align:start position:0%
um does this include
um

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.629 align:start position:0%
um
staff

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:06.419 align:start position:0%
being trained and always having a staff
 
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
member in the restaurant at all times to
 
00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:13.139 align:start position:0%
adhere to the new rules
 
00:08:14.809 --> 00:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is that this
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
certified food protection manager on
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
staff at all times in restaurants and
 
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:21.240 align:start position:0%
less uh which generally are the the
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
manager that is trained this all the
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
staff is trained on food allergies
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
allergens the certified the certified
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
food protection manager is the person
 
00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
that sort of implements that within the
 
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
restaurant as far as additional training
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
I think that you know there's certainly
 
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
that person does the training and
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
certainly would communicate the new rule
 
00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:42.539 align:start position:0%
change to
 
00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
um the employees of the restaurant and
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
certainly I would imagine encourage
 
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
servers to be aware and you know it's
 
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
not in the statute or in law that they
 
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
have to ask whether there is a food
 
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
allergy but it would encourage customers
 
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
to patrons of the restaurant to
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
contribute that information for the
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
question just a follow-up
 
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
um how can one guarantee that that
 
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
professional is going to be in the
 
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
restaurant or that everybody's going to
 
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
adhere to the policy I really don't see
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
you can't guarantee that everybody that
 
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:15.260 align:start position:0%
goes into the restaurant will be
 
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
guaranteed that protection because it
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
may not be that staff person there they
 
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
may not be trained so is theirs
 
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
there's maybe a disclosure that a
 
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
restaurant can put in the window I guess
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
they can do whatever they want to do
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
that there's no staff
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
you know that can guarantee that can
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
guarantee that
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
the employees are abiding by the rules
 
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
great thank you for the question I know
 
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
that the new rules you know require
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
require the allergies to be allergens to
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
be listed
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
um again we encourage our restaurants to
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
encourage uh conversation about
 
00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:54.779 align:start position:0%
allergens um you know I think putting
 
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
that on the menu board
 
00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
um is a reminder for folks to share that
 
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.410 align:start position:0%
um is a reminder for folks to share that
information

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
um I I don't believe that
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
um I think it's hard to
 
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.509 align:start position:0%
um I think it's hard to
um

00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:08.220 align:start position:0%
have 100 compliance with that but
 
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
certainly food allergies is you know
 
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
it's certainly a very
 
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
um serious concern for many people and
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
we would hope that people uh would do
 
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
the best that they can but also
 
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
um sort of self-advocate for themselves
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
if they have an allergen and some of
 
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
that some of that is you know something
 
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
that could be reminded of for allergists
 
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
and providers to to speak to their
 
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
patients that have food allergies to
 
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
remind them that it's really important
 
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
to provide that information when eating
 
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
out in a restaurant
 
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:46.370 align:start position:0%
 
these

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
turn on your mic please
 
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
um I think I'm remembering correctly
 
00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:56.339 align:start position:0%
um these reminders notices uh
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
need to be on the menu only not posted
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
around the building or I know there was
 
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:04.140 align:start position:0%
some discussion on one of these bills
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
that more than just on the menu was
 
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
required is the information on the menu
 
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
sufficient thank you I believe that it's
 
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
up the requirement is on the menu but
 
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
also any kind of menu board that the
 
00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
restaurant should have so if public
 
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
facing board where they might list
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
specials or other restaurant food items
 
00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:26.170 align:start position:0%
specials or other restaurant food items
listed

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:26.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.050 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
okay

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
perfect four minutes left thank you very
 
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.670 align:start position:0%
perfect four minutes left thank you very
much

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
okay and just uh for the committee
 
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.670 align:start position:0%
okay and just uh for the committee
members

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.449 align:start position:0%
members
um

00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:41.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:43.740 align:start position:0%
I realized that uh some people were
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about are doing our exact
 
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
session Wednesday the 26th I did that
 
00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:51.899 align:start position:0%
because uh Heather was not here and I
 
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
was kind of panicked to making sure that
 
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
we had an exact session scheduled
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
um what my expectation is that if we go
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
through this list and then tomorrow we
 
00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
find something that we want to come back
 
00:12:08.449 --> 00:12:08.459 align:start position:0%
and meet again on uh we can do that and
 
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:10.019 align:start position:0%
then push off the exact session
 
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
otherwise I would I would accelerate if
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
we get through both of them and find
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
nothing I would accelerate the exact
 
00:12:20.569 --> 00:12:20.579 align:start position:0%
session for next week
 
00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:23.579 align:start position:0%
so yes representative I have a question
 
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm confused so do any of these have
 
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:28.200 align:start position:0%
the any of these bills actually had
 
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
interim study committees
 
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
no but that's what we're doing right now
 
00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm yeah right now we're
 
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
discussing whether if we want to do a
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
study I mean that we can take it up you
 
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
know uh we can work on it next week but
 
00:12:44.569 --> 00:12:44.579 align:start position:0%
my question is isn't it the procedure or
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
at least the custom that there be a
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
committee have met during the summer and
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
come back and Report the customers
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
usually we would meet after September
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
in this committee now I know some I
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
don't know as far as I know most
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
committees weren't allowed to meet in
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
the summer
 
00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:04.139 align:start position:0%
chapter studies could meet but uh enter
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
you weren't allowed to do interim study
 
00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:08.519 align:start position:0%
committees this summer over the summer
 
00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
yeah as far as I knew
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
that it's been changed but that was only
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
chapter studies so normally we would
 
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
meet in the first week of September
 
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:18.860 align:start position:0%
there was some requests to delay that
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
and frankly I went through the list and
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
I didn't really see anything that was I
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to really spend a
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
lot want to spend time on so that's why
 
00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:31.139 align:start position:0%
I I have this cramp schedule
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
so I take responsibility for that
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:43.220 align:start position:0%
almost almost there
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh so the next one is uh relative to
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
establishing a Statewide fruit food
 
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
truck license
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
is there anybody here who wants to weigh
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
in on this one so the way I saw this
 
00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
issue is that we actually do have a
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide license
 
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
however if you want to have a truck in a
 
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:08.420 align:start position:0%
town or city that has its own license
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
you would still have to get a separate
 
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.829 align:start position:0%
you would still have to get a separate
license

00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:15.779 align:start position:0%
and since I sensed there was no city or
 
00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
town who was willing to give that up for
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
the state one then I think this is one
 
00:14:23.449 --> 00:14:23.459 align:start position:0%
of those classic bills which is uh has
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
some great you know great concept to it
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
for streamlining government but that
 
00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:29.579 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the the precedent has
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
already been set that cities and towns
 
00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
have their own license they're not going
 
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
to want to give up that that prerogative
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
and so at this point
 
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
um with it's not you know going forward
 
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
with this legislation it's probably
 
00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
um and there is one food service truck
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
with a Statewide license already
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
and it's uh over at the park
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh on the uh on the other side of
 
00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.569 align:start position:0%
uh on the uh on the other side of
Portsmouth

00:14:59.569 --> 00:14:59.579 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth
 
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
what's the uh
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
is it Prescott I don't know the name but
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's somebody has a food truck with a
 
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
Statewide license yeah there's plenty of
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
people have a Statewide license in other
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
words in my town because we don't have
 
00:15:14.449 --> 00:15:14.459 align:start position:0%
any uh uh the the health department if
 
00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:15.899 align:start position:0%
you want to call that the person who
 
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
charge our health does not have you know
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
you've been given that Authority by the
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
Selectmen then they are required to have
 
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
a state license so the state license
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
does exist and a lot of people have them
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
um and but that at the end of the day
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
um as representative Hammond points out
 
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
it's location it's getting getting that
 
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.220 align:start position:0%
location and getting that landlord who's
 
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
willing to give you the space and and
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
some cities and towns you know obviously
 
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
have other authority uh regulatory
 
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
Authority and to to have the state Trump
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
those cities and towns
 
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
would create a a
 
00:15:56.569 --> 00:15:56.579 align:start position:0%
a legislative nightmare in my in my mind
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
but I'll open to anybody else's comments
 
00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:04.860 align:start position:0%
um is there going to be a um a report on
 
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
this because I know that there are lsrs
 
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
that have been filed regarding uh food
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
licensing and I think some of them might
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
be from corks good question so I guess
 
00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
when we go through this and we're
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
probably going back to the first one
 
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
each one of these one if we all kind of
 
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
agree that we're gonna what we're going
 
00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
um we would I would be entertaining that
 
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
motion when we accept the bill for uh
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
recommend for or against future
 
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.970 align:start position:0%
recommend for or against future
legislation

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
so representative I think I'm going to
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
put your name down as recommending not
 
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
going forward with future legislation so
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
you'll be prepared to do that when we
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
exec it yes thank you okay
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson
 
00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just going to say that I like
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
the idea of the bill
 
00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:48.530 align:start position:0%
the idea of the bill
um

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
from the get-go the reason is I look at
 
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
legislation in terms of what it's going
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
to do in the future I do know uh have
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
known some food truck operators and I
 
00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:02.339 align:start position:0%
um where I work we have a difficult time
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
sometimes getting food trucks and the
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
food truck operators will sometimes say
 
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
well you know you in order to come and
 
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
and serve you guys during uh you know
 
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
lunch hours or three o'clock to five
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
o'clock or something like that in order
 
00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
to move the truck around they have to
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
get a license from every town and I felt
 
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
that if someone got a license it could
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
be a town license that's recognized
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide or it could just be one state
 
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
license the one state license made made
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
more sense to me if you're gonna if
 
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
you're gonna essentially have something
 
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:32.220 align:start position:0%
that's registered somewhere
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
um you know as a business it made sense
 
00:17:36.169 --> 00:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
to also get wherever you know the
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
business license is usually done through
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
the or the incorporation is done through
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
the state it made sense to me to just go
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
ahead and have it just you know do it
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
once and allow it because it's a truck
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
allow it to move from town to town
 
00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
wherever the demand is now obviously I
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
represent uh the southern Seacoast so
 
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
the demand during the summer is very
 
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
different from the demand in the winter
 
00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
so perhaps some trucks would want to
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
come out and serve some of the demand
 
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
you know out along Route 1 or uh that
 
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
area during the summer time and might
 
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
want to move around that's kind of one
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
of the benefits of the truck but I think
 
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
that uh I think having a Statewide
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
license made sense as a concept
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
right but you understand that the
 
00:18:18.049 --> 00:18:18.059 align:start position:0%
problem is we have a state line license
 
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
and and pretty much all the cities and
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
towns probably required to get that
 
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
license anyways so that's a license
 
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
everybody has the intent of the
 
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
legislation was that it would Trump
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
any City or Town's own regulations
 
00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
related to food trucks by saying is as
 
00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:39.720 align:start position:0%
long as they had that state license they
 
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
were not required to get that Community
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
license do you agree with that I I
 
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:45.900 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying but I
 
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
would liken it to say State firearms
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
license versus a federal firearms
 
00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
license the federal firearms license
 
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:54.660 align:start position:0%
it's a much higher standard to get
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
and it make it makes sense I have
 
00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
private investigators and people who
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
work on the border they get a federal
 
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
firearms license and even federal
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
employees the federal is a higher much
 
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
higher standard admittedly to get that
 
00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
once you have that it's a higher
 
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
standard than any state would ever have
 
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
for a concealed weapons permit so it
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's something that uh current and
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
former uh
 
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.450 align:start position:0%
former uh
um

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
Federal enforcement uh have everywhere
 
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
and that the gun dealers have
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
um it it makes sense to me even if it's
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
a higher standard for a state license
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
that it's a higher standard than any
 
00:19:33.289 --> 00:19:33.299 align:start position:0%
particular town has once you go through
 
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
the process a food truck should be
 
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
allowed to move throughout the state
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
um and looking at it from the consumer
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
standpoint it it it makes sense that
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
once the higher standard is met why not
 
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
let the truck do what a food truck does
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
which is drive to where the demand is at
 
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
that particular time of year that
 
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
particular time of day not
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
okay well by the way I understand you're
 
00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:57.539 align:start position:0%
saying this okay you use that example
 
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:00.419 align:start position:0%
that would mean that there would be no
 
00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:01.310 align:start position:0%
that would mean that there would be no
state

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
gun laws
 
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
because there's a federal gun law there
 
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
would be no state law that's what this
 
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
bill does what this bill does says is
 
00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
that if the city in town has a code
 
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
enforcer who goes around to every
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
restaurant and makes sure that those
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
those restaurants are in compliance with
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
all the food and whatever the
 
00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:21.890 align:start position:0%
all the food and whatever the
requirements

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
that this legislation was intent was to
 
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
say they did not have any right to
 
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.590 align:start position:0%
say they did not have any right to
regulate

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:33.539 align:start position:0%
a food truck that because the state had
 
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
a regulation they
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
had no Authority
 
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
do you agree with that
 
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
do I do I agree with something
 
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
philosophically or am I saying no that's
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
what the bill did what I'm saying so we
 
00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
without we held the bill because there
 
00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:51.539 align:start position:0%
are issues that are opened up that might
 
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
be worked on later
 
00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
right so the code enforcement officer
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
comes around and makes sure among other
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
things that you already have a license
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
if somebody has a town license or a
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
state license they already have a food
 
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.029 align:start position:0%
state license they already have a food
license

00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
I don't see
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
from for that particular interaction I
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
don't see a reason why that code
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer they checked the
 
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
hygiene they've made sure that you're
 
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
everyone's tested as a food handler's
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
permit and so forth and you have a
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
license if it's a town license or you or
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
a state license in in my opinion either
 
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
way I I don't believe that the code
 
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer should be shutting
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
down a food truck or telling them you
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
have to go to this other town because
 
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
you're safe to serve in Hampton but
 
00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
you're not yet safe to serve in Seabrook
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
if you already have a state license then
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
you already have you've already gone
 
00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:42.299 align:start position:0%
through the process why make someone go
 
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
through the process again for 239
 
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
different people because that city or
 
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
town had regulations that were not
 
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
included in the Statewide one
 
00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.029 align:start position:0%
included in the Statewide one
foreign

00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.529 --> 00:21:57.539 align:start position:0%
well you and I see it differently we're
 
00:21:59.810 --> 00:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
different members and I I presume that
 
00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be voting the same
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
way just as we haven't been voting the
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
same way very often uh on the floor okay
 
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
any more discussion on
 
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
okay uh just to go back to 65 who would
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
like to make the motion of not
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation on
 
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
the allergy awareness procedure Billy
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
you want to do that one also okay great
 
00:22:26.039 --> 00:22:28.490 align:start position:0%
you want to do that one also okay great
foreign

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
so if we get through all these bills
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
today with the consensus
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
then we could move the exact session up
 
00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:39.299 align:start position:0%
to next week
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
right now it's scheduled for the 26th
 
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
because I didn't want I want to leave
 
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
the opportunity that if we had something
 
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
where we're kind of divided on that we
 
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.610 align:start position:0%
where we're kind of divided on that we
could

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:51.299 align:start position:0%
we could work on it
 
00:22:51.299 --> 00:22:57.789 align:start position:0%
we could work on it
okay

00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:57.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh I don't see
 
00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419 align:start position:0%
episode well it might not be here I know
 
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
I talked to him
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
um HB 1589 prohibiting the sale of
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
products containing intentionally added
 
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.870 align:start position:0%
products containing intentionally added
pfas

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
um I did talk to representative Boyle
 
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and he agrees this is this
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
issue is way bigger than than he he or
 
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
anybody has imagined and I assume you
 
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
all got emails you know from
 
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
different lobbyist groups you know
 
00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:36.539 align:start position:0%
interested on it I can tell my own
 
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
personal story and that is that um
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
My Family Foundation we have a grantee
 
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
who's uh was very proud of uh
 
00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
legislation to happen in the state of
 
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
Washington I didn't actually find out
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what they did but
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
um so now you know I'm intrigued to
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
learn more about this and about pfas and
 
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
so wherever iOS I talked about it so two
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
weeks ago I was at a wedding in in
 
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
Killington Vermont
 
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.580 align:start position:0%
um and which I was very excited to do
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
because I'm I'm on the committee too if
 
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
Killington does separate from the union
 
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
from Vermont and I'm on the designated
 
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
person because I was chair of
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
legislative administration at the time
 
00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:18.059 align:start position:0%
that uh that would be part of the
 
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
welcoming committee to that they could
 
00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
come to me we would take him on this is
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
a community in New Hampshire
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
um but notwithstanding that so when I
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
was talking to the the hotel I was
 
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
staying at he's he mentioned that they
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
had a pfas problem in Killington
 
00:24:36.409 --> 00:24:36.419 align:start position:0%
and I called Killington then repeat that
 
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
but ski wax I mean what could what could
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
be the problem in there and I looked it
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
up and there was two towns I mean two
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
schools two schools
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
and uh another condo development
 
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:53.820 align:start position:0%
and so when I talked to representative
 
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
Boyle about it and I said the only thing
 
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
I could figure out probably happened was
 
00:24:59.570 --> 00:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
and they have not actually determined
 
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
exactly where the pfas came from but
 
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
that the only thing I think going to
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
happen is from base what little
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
knowledge I now have on pfas it was
 
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
probably the cleaning products that they
 
00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:12.539 align:start position:0%
were using in the schools
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
and that every time they would take they
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
would dump the bucket out into the into
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
the sinks and oh there you are okay and
 
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
then uh and they would dump them out and
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
I think that that just somehow got into
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
their septic you know the septic from
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
their septic it got into their water
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
system and polluted their water and uh
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
but even Vermont having having that
 
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
problem they're having trouble getting
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
struggling to enforce this uh regulation
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
on those school districts to change
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
their water so at this point in time
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
those two schools they give out bottled
 
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
water you cannot drink the water in the
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
in the school but
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
so uh clearly you know pfas is a major
 
00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
federal issue that's got to be resolved
 
00:25:57.049 --> 00:25:57.059 align:start position:0%
at some point uh the EPA I guess when
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
the governor of California vetoed the
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
bill there he did mention that that the
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
EPA is working on trying to regulate it
 
00:26:06.169 --> 00:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
and trying to figure out get her arms
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
around from whether it's 6 000 or 12
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
000 you know how you know how many
 
00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
different you know different pfas you
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
know elements are out there but you know
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
even when you read you know you think
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
about car parts and how many different
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
elements of a car that might have this
 
00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:24.299 align:start position:0%
type of beef house it's just it's going
 
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
to be a real bear to try to rein this in
 
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
representative Bartlett thanks to Mr
 
00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.510 align:start position:0%
representative Bartlett thanks to Mr
chair

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think that I mean from all the
 
00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:33.620 align:start position:0%
testimony we had Des is certainly very
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
involved with trying to figure out how
 
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
many parts per billion is acceptable
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
um I think that this is way further than
 
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:44.940 align:start position:0%
what the state is going to be able to to
 
00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
really um handle I what I've got here is
 
00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
that Maine passed a bill they put 40
 
00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
million dollars appropriated but we
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
tried to get information about
 
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.210 align:start position:0%
tried to get information about
um

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:56.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
you know how how they were moving
 
00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:00.059 align:start position:0%
forward with it yeah it's a moving
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
Target right now because they keep
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
creating exemptions and saying we're not
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
ready we're not ready we're not ready so
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
at this point it's p faster everywhere
 
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
everywhere and somewhere along the line
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
we've got to figure out one you know how
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
to stop the supply line and two in
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
communicating I think this bill I think
 
00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:20.700 align:start position:0%
was carpets we had carpets was in this
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
bill and you know carpets I guess is
 
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.070 align:start position:0%
bill and you know carpets I guess is
Scotchgard

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
Scotchgard
 
00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:26.460 align:start position:0%
right I think about how much Furniture
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
you know people you know thought you
 
00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
know somehow great Scotchgard was a
 
00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
so um yeah I don't think there's
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
something we can do okay
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
so the recommendation yes representative
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I just want to um add to that that
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
the wastewater treatment plants in um
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
all the towns and cities I mean it's
 
00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
going to cost millions and billions of
 
00:27:57.049 --> 00:27:57.059 align:start position:0%
dollars to get pfas out of our you know
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
drinking water so
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
um I think it's all about you know
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
funding we're not going to stop the
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturing of pfas what communities
 
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
need to do is address it through their
 
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant to get it out
 
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
of our drinking water
 
00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
and that's going to cost billions so I
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
mean it's huge it's huge it's not just
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
the sourcing it's it's the and it's
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
really a federal in mindset this is a
 
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
federal issue that that it's got to
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
happen Nationwide and we gotta so okay
 
00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
so who would like to make a motion of to
 
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
or who would like to bring that forward
 
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:34.380 align:start position:0%
when we accept this bill for not
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.409 --> 00:28:45.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.409 --> 00:28:47.419 align:start position:0%
okay I don't want to get too far ahead
 
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
did uh did you want to speak to you you
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
want any do you want anybody want to
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
offer up anything yeah
 
00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:57.470 align:start position:0%
offer up anything yeah
yeah

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:29:03.169 --> 00:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
I just I I understand that we probably
 
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
where we probably would have gone with
 
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
this bill but I find it distressing that
 
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
we're finding spending five minutes on
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
something so important as pfas and I
 
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
understand all the pfases and everything
 
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
but I think it would have been
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
a good idea to look at if there even
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
were small things that we could do
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
Statewide to keep it out of our water
 
00:29:27.529 --> 00:29:27.539 align:start position:0%
systems it's okay do you have any ideas
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
yeah no I I don't think that this is the
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
place to just throw out ideas I was
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
hoping that there'd be a study committee
 
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
over the summer that would have come
 
00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:36.539 align:start position:0%
forth that's what I was expecting ah
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
that would have been a chapter study
 
00:29:39.909 --> 00:29:39.919 align:start position:0%
committee whatever you want to call it
 
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:42.980 align:start position:0%
well how long have you been a red
 
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
Representative no go on okay right the
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
difference between a chapter study
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
committee and an interim study committee
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
is an interim study is kept within the
 
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
committee and the committee is then
 
00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
doing the work a chapter study committee
 
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:00.860 align:start position:0%
is uh is can be during the summer
 
00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
and they invite people who are experts
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
in the field and get them in and make
 
00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:09.539 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh to how to address
 
00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:12.419 align:start position:0%
that issue so what you're saying is you
 
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
wish this had been a chapter study
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
committee rather an interim study
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
committee could have met over the summer
 
00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
I not really clear why it couldn't have
 
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
well that's a whole other problem no we
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
didn't if we weren't doing anything but
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
resume now but no interim study is
 
00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
totally different than chapter study
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
yeah I just like to mention that the
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
pfas issue as it becomes more and more
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
known by uh corporations there are
 
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
places where it really is changing uh
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
and one is the ski wax industry you
 
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
can't find ski wax anymore with pfas in
 
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
it because FIS has banned it and the
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
state of Vermont also banned it and the
 
00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
other thing is that um I work up at the
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
Canon advisory committee with a guy
 
00:31:05.169 --> 00:31:05.179 align:start position:0%
who's involved in the car wash industry
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
and I I've talked to him about simonize
 
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
and because that was one of the other
 
00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
sources of pfas Simoniz doesn't have
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
pfas in it anymore they've changed their
 
00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
formula so as people become more aware
 
00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:21.419 align:start position:0%
of the problem there are places where
 
00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:22.980 align:start position:0%
it's really beginning to change
 
00:31:25.549 --> 00:31:25.559 align:start position:0%
so we just have to keep pushing them but
 
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
but I think you're just getting more
 
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
public awareness about the exactly and
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on but you know in New
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're very fortunate you know
 
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
we're fortunate or not fortunate you
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
know because of peas and Merrimack that
 
00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
it really became a Forefront issue you
 
00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
know the piece uh because of the fire
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
retardant you know who knew that that's
 
00:31:45.049 --> 00:31:45.059 align:start position:0%
what pfas was was all about was putting
 
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
out putting out fires and and they were
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
worried about the the airplanes
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
um you know their air cargo planes over
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
there they're carrying jet fuel
 
00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
um so they they were they practiced one
 
00:31:58.730 --> 00:31:58.740 align:start position:0%
too many times in terms of saturating
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
the ground with that stuff
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
so representative Abramson Yep this was
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
another issue where I uh didn't agree
 
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
with the the bill as written and but I
 
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
agreed that there was a problem there
 
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
was an issue and I I felt that this was
 
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
one that we kind of can of worms that we
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
had to kind of open up
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
um and we we talked about a lot of
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
different things maybe this isn't the
 
00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.070 align:start position:0%
different things maybe this isn't the
bill

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:25.140 align:start position:0%
to do it someone will come from
 
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
the next session will come up with a
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
different Bill who knows who the voter
 
00:32:30.649 --> 00:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
is going to read voters will re-elect
 
00:32:32.389 --> 00:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
um I mean we've talked over the years
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
about a number of different ideas like
 
00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:39.059 align:start position:0%
putting a a 10 cent tax or something on
 
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
something so that shows up on your
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
receipt so that you know oh there's a
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
pfas tax you see it on the bill
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
everybody knows what's not going to
 
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
generate very much revenue for this for
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
the for the state but at least it shows
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
up on the bill or just a requirement
 
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:55.860 align:start position:0%
that it shows up uh when a business pays
 
00:32:57.649 --> 00:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
for something that they can get some
 
00:32:59.510 --> 00:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
type of notice that uh
 
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
this product contains pfast or a label
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
or or a sticker who knows what
 
00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
um I recognize that the the bill
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't pass as is but I I felt that
 
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:10.380 align:start position:0%
something should be done about this
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
we're finding about out about the cancer
 
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if it it's not something
 
00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:21.059 align:start position:0%
where we would recommend this particular
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
legislation but we do recommend some
 
00:33:24.529 --> 00:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
to deal with it right but as you know we
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
you know can't bind the future and
 
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
obviously anybody
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
who who uh comes back next year can
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
certainly introduce legislation right
 
00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
that's why it's just a recommendation
 
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:40.140 align:start position:0%
right it's just a recommendation on this
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill as written
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
that's this bill as written is not
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
recommended it would be no well maybe
 
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
maybe this is more of a parliamentary
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
inquiry when we say we recommend this
 
00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
issue for future legislation or we
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
recommend this bill as written for
 
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
future that's a great question uh in the
 
00:33:59.090 --> 00:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
old days uh we actually had that option
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
in the old days we actually have
 
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
recommended not recommended or
 
00:34:07.089 --> 00:34:07.099 align:start position:0%
recommended with with Amendment
 
00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:11.339 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure where I think this is
 
00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
the second term around that where they
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
deleted that phrase from the Motions
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
that can be accepted
 
00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
but we did actually have that used to
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
have that
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
okay I don't want to get too far ahead
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
so why don't we take a 10 minute break
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
okay why don't we uh start again
 
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
and um so I apologize I didn't make sure
 
00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:16.740 align:start position:0%
I I sometimes my look in the audience I
 
00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
make assumptions on who's in the
 
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
audience for what issues and and uh so I
 
00:45:23.809 --> 00:45:23.819 align:start position:0%
I will make sure if you're here for a
 
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
certain Bill wave your hand make sure I
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
see you know that you want to talk about
 
00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:30.900 align:start position:0%
it um offer up something okay but yeah
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
so the the the
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
conclusion is that we now know that
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
there are several commissions already on
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
pfas here in the state and that there is
 
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
model legislation being proposed and
 
00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
being worked on and whether you know
 
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
whether it comes in next year or
 
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
whatever but it's it's going to happen
 
00:45:48.589 --> 00:45:48.599 align:start position:0%
soon enough
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
you know I think this just goes back to
 
00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
when we look at our files and we don't
 
00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
always have our files in front of us
 
00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.050 align:start position:0%
always have our files in front of us
right

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor on this had consulted no
 
00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.410 align:start position:0%
um the sponsor on this had consulted no
one

00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:45:59.089 --> 00:45:59.099 align:start position:0%
um he really hadn't done his homework
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
before he found the bill so
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
um that put him on the spot yeah when he
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
was here and it was harder for us to to
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
move forward on it because we didn't
 
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
have some of this information right so
 
00:46:11.809 --> 00:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
yeah that's great thank you very much
 
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
and he was from Merrimack and he was
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
well doing it you know doing constituent
 
00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.950 align:start position:0%
well doing it you know doing constituent
work

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh HP 333 relative to the sale and
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
distribution of Kratom products
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
uh as I remember this was a department
 
00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
issue and uh you want to just tell us
 
00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:35.220 align:start position:0%
what's happening you know within the
 
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um Abby Rogers legislative
 
00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:43.260 align:start position:0%
liaison for the division of Public
 
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
Health Services I just wanted to remind
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
the committee that the department had
 
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
serious concerns with this bill
 
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
um HP 333 as the bill would have
 
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
um would have kind of categorized create
 
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
him as a food product and uh there are
 
00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:01.740 align:start position:0%
no there's no FDA food product the food
 
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
code is regulated by the FDA and
 
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
currently there's no FDA approved use
 
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:08.700 align:start position:0%
for Kratom so that was one of our
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
concerns FDA has also issued warnings
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
um related to the serious risks
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
associated with the use of Kratom
 
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
um you know risk of addiction abuse and
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
dependence uh so we're and we also you
 
00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:23.339 align:start position:0%
know had contacted the Poison Control
 
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
Center to sort of see what you know what
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
the stats were around calls related
 
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
creative and you know I think um in
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
between 2012 and 2019 there are about 94
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
reports of adverse effects exposure to
 
00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.750 align:start position:0%
reports of adverse effects exposure to
Kratom

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
Kratom
 
00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:38.099 align:start position:0%
um so as far as 333 concern is concerned
 
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
we have concerns about that we had
 
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
testified to such during the hearing on
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
the bill and just wanted to refresh your
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
memories that we we have serious
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bill great
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
so uh I have a sense that we probably
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to go forward with this
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
legislation is uh representative averson
 
00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
you have a comment yeah I just want to
 
00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:58.619 align:start position:0%
make a quick comment
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
um so I I did talk to constituents you
 
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
know person to person I did ask people
 
00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
directly what their opinion was either
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
philosophically didn't also get a lot of
 
00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.410 align:start position:0%
philosophically didn't also get a lot of
emails

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
emails
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and I believe that this was uh posted
 
00:48:13.609 --> 00:48:13.619 align:start position:0%
on online forums
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
um every single
 
00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
um person I talked to or who emailed me
 
00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:20.339 align:start position:0%
or reached out to me whether they were
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
using it or not said that they were in
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
favor of letting people do this I did I
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
think I saw one comment maybe on
 
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
citizens count or something where they
 
00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
were against allowing it but but if
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
people needed it the the reason that uh
 
00:48:34.609 --> 00:48:34.619 align:start position:0%
some people
 
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
were using it was
 
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
um to get off of heroin
 
00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:41.339 align:start position:0%
um and that had
 
00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
mostly positive results but if it even
 
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
works ten percent of the time I think
 
00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:47.339 align:start position:0%
that that would be a good enough reason
 
00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:50.460 align:start position:0%
to allow it and
 
00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
um but by and large it was people facing
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
depression or PTSD and their doctor or
 
00:48:58.609 --> 00:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
medical professional they talked to
 
00:48:58.619 --> 00:48:59.980 align:start position:0%
medical professional they talked to
psychiatrist

00:48:59.980 --> 00:48:59.990 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.650 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist
[Music]

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:01.430 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
said it's kind of you know prescription
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
drugs or Kratom
 
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:07.740 align:start position:0%
um and many of them recommended Kratom
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
rather than some of the opioids and
 
00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs that were out there
 
00:49:10.859 --> 00:49:12.170 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs that were out there
so

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
um philosophically I believe that people
 
00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
have the right to
 
00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
eat or drink or smoke whatever they
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
choose it's their own body that you
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
don't belong to the state
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
but as on on the medical question if
 
00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:28.140 align:start position:0%
there are medical symptoms if if people
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
have a recommendation that they use it
 
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
that uh that this seems to be less
 
00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
harmful than some of the prescription
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
drugs or
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
worse just a kind of chancing depression
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
and a further symptoms
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
so there is no actual law in New
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that makes Kratom illegal
 
00:49:47.569 --> 00:49:47.579 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is Kratom is legal
 
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
for age 21 and Over
 
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
except for in the city say it again so
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
that was Asian sorry I believe that it's
 
00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
legal in New Hampshire from if you're if
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
you're 21 to use kratom however the city
 
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
of Franklin is the only town and the
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
only city in New Hampshire that has made
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
it illegal for use right okay
 
00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
you follow that Mike said it is legal in
 
00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire except stay out of
 
00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:19.309 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire except stay out of
Franklin

00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
I'll reach out to the sponsor I believe
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
what he said so this is a going back a
 
00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
year I think he said that uh they needed
 
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
it regulated for some
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
for some reason relating to uh uh
 
00:50:35.809 --> 00:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing that they have so many
 
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
states regulating it and being able to
 
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
respond going to the feds if the fed's
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
ever tried to ban it
 
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:46.020 align:start position:0%
um so like I say I'm willing to go back
 
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
to the sponsor and get more feedback
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
fair enough representative okay so at
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
this point my sense is that we're not
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
recommending for future legislation uh
 
00:51:01.329 --> 00:51:01.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay great
 
00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:13.030 align:start position:0%
okay great
um

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
I guess I shouldn't have done it by time
 
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:18.349 align:start position:0%
I guess I shouldn't have done it by time
certains

00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
um next uh it's HP 1378 relative
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
inspection of public lodging houses
 
00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:26.339 align:start position:0%
all right I'll start with it is there
 
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
anybody in the audience who here wants
 
00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:28.790 align:start position:0%
anybody in the audience who here wants
to

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
speak on this issue or talk about oh
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
so I I know I assume she she's from law
 
00:51:41.089 --> 00:51:41.099 align:start position:0%
enforcement and therefore would
 
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
recommend that we would not do this
 
00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
legislation is there anybody here who
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
um I have to admit I wanted to work on
 
00:51:57.950 --> 00:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
this bill I mean I wanted to because the
 
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
language of the statue was very archaic
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
uh because I'm pretty sure there aren't
 
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
too many hotels that actually have a
 
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
book that you sign in on since I never
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
signed in on anything
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
um but that clearly the electronic
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
signing that we have electronic systems
 
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
that we now have place at restaurant
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
that hotels have is is similar to what
 
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
that legislation was and then but then
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
as I I kept going over and trying to
 
00:52:29.809 --> 00:52:29.819 align:start position:0%
figure how would I fix this how do I
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
modernize it it kept creating unintended
 
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
consequences so that then I so then I I
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
I'll fall back on one that I hate to do
 
00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:44.099 align:start position:0%
it's not part of my nature it is that
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
there is plenty of case law around the
 
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
way this bill is written the language of
 
00:52:52.329 --> 00:52:52.339 align:start position:0%
the bill the law is now and so therefore
 
00:52:55.069 --> 00:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
mucking it up or changing it you know
 
00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
with an obviously change case law but
 
00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
since case law had there hasn't been any
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
glaring problem and that's usually when
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
we get to hear about it is that case law
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
that people come back and say the courts
 
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
got it wrong
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
you know and that wanted us to revisit
 
00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:12.410 align:start position:0%
you know and that wanted us to revisit
it

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
but at this point I I didn't see any
 
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
evidence of that so I'm I'm more apt to
 
00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
yeah just representative yeah as I
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
recall this bill and
 
00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:34.740 align:start position:0%
the discussion uh in in uh when we were
 
00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
having hearings I thought we were
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
hearing from uh
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement that they found they
 
00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:46.740 align:start position:0%
thought we should pass this bill now I
 
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
might be wrong but
 
00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:49.630 align:start position:0%
might be wrong but
but

00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
both sides from one person but I
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
remember there were a number of people
 
00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
in law enforcement who said that they
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
that this was a way for them to track
 
00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:05.420 align:start position:0%
people that they were they were looking
 
00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
arrest and could somebody clarify that
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
so the issue is was that if you might
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
remember the testimony he was going on
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
about Nazi Germany and the idea of
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
somebody uh being able to say who who is
 
00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:38.339 align:start position:0%
in your hotel who's that that the law
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement has carte blanche to you
 
00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
know you know gestapo has the carte
 
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
blanche to come in and say who's checked
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
into your hotel
 
00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
and and demand that the hotel turnover
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
its records or should you know show who
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
who is who is in the hotel
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
uh he he he was it was about protecting
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
of the you know the right of privacy
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
really if he's talking about the writer
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
probably that the person should not have
 
00:55:10.849 --> 00:55:10.859 align:start position:0%
to uh you know that that when you sign
 
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
into a hotel you would hope that you
 
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
have some
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.089 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:55:20.089 --> 00:55:20.099 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:24.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
yes great
 
00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:29.210 align:start position:0%
yes great
yeah

00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:29.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
okay okay so yo yeah once you please
 
00:55:33.119 --> 00:55:38.990 align:start position:0%
okay okay so yo yeah once you please
thanks

00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's it hi good morning representative
 
00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
hot members of the committee my name is
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth Sargent I work for she
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
Infinity Capital group here today
 
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:47.220 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
Association of chiefs of police
 
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
um in looking at this we did not ask for
 
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
this legislation to be introduced and
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
testified against the bill things are
 
00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
working representative Heinz correct
 
00:55:59.450 --> 00:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
case law
 
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
um is uh has been very helpful and we
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
think this bill is not needed at this
 
00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.230 align:start position:0%
think this bill is not needed at this
time

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:56:08.750 --> 00:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
and I if you remember now that it's all
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
coming back to me uh the Manchester
 
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:13.140 align:start position:0%
Police Department testified that they
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
have good relationships with the hotel
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
owners and we do have trafficking here
 
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
in our state and other crimes
 
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
um they need the protections that are in
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
place currently so we would be opposed
 
00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:29.329 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
um I I apologize for uh not remembering
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
this that's okay
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson uh would I be
 
00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:40.740 align:start position:0%
appropriate to ask yes you may
 
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
um so uh maybe it was it must have been
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
last session
 
00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:47.220 align:start position:0%
um I believe
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
that it was another committee it must
 
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
have been criminal justice
 
00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:52.849 align:start position:0%
have been criminal justice
um

00:56:52.849 --> 00:56:52.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:54.900 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs or police departments were
 
00:56:58.130 --> 00:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
investigating officers who
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
um they'd had Ex-Wives or ex-girlfriends
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
sorry it was on a domestic violence
 
00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:03.730 align:start position:0%
sorry it was on a domestic violence
issue

00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:03.740 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
uh where the
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
I guess I shouldn't even say uh police
 
00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
but the the
 
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
battered spouse goes and checks into a
 
00:57:16.089 --> 00:57:16.099 align:start position:0%
hotel or motel
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
without this legislation is there a
 
00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:20.700 align:start position:0%
danger that
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
just an individual officer could be
 
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
going around to different hotels a lot
 
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
local lodging without a warrant and then
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
trying to track down their
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
significant other
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
in other words I always look at uh
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
I always look at use of power as the
 
00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
potential for abusive power you know
 
00:57:38.809 --> 00:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
could there be an individual could there
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
be a bad actor out there
 
00:57:43.130 --> 00:57:43.140 align:start position:0%
is is this going to be something where
 
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
she's got to remember to sign in under a
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
false name
 
00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:48.300 align:start position:0%
you know they're using
 
00:57:50.329 --> 00:57:50.339 align:start position:0%
people usually use credit cards or debit
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
cards to to enter if if her privacy to
 
00:57:56.569 --> 00:57:56.579 align:start position:0%
kind of escape a lot of people who go
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
into lodging
 
00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
um temporarily are doing so unexpectedly
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
to get away from a violent person I mean
 
00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
I would I would hope
 
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
um that that would not be the case with
 
00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
all of their training and the checks and
 
00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:09.950 align:start position:0%
all of their training and the checks and
balances

00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
balances
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
um with departments and I know the
 
00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
Departments have a good relationship
 
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
with the hotel owners so they're not
 
00:58:17.329 --> 00:58:17.339 align:start position:0%
going in frivolously and asking to see
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
rosters of people normally they have a
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
case or there's a situation there was a
 
00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
situation in Manchester
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
um a year or so ago where they needed to
 
00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:29.420 align:start position:0%
help the people escape from the hotel
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
there was a situation so having the
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
roster helps them get to those people
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
and get them out of the hotel so that
 
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
they could
 
00:58:41.089 --> 00:58:41.099 align:start position:0%
um take care of that situation so I
 
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
I would hope that would not be the case
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
I would I would not think that would be
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
the case they'd be allowed to go in and
 
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't there be a problem if they
 
00:58:59.210 --> 00:58:59.220 align:start position:0%
were to try to pursue a case that they
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
would the probable cause would issue
 
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
would come up yeah and the case would
 
00:59:05.329 --> 00:59:05.339 align:start position:0%
get thrown out if there was no probable
 
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
cause for sure other than just fishing
 
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for helping me representative
 
00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.289 align:start position:0%
thank you for helping me representative
so

00:59:12.289 --> 00:59:12.299 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
so right now they do or don't need a
 
00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:15.770 align:start position:0%
so right now they do or don't need a
warrant

00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
to look at the the roster of people in a
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
in lodging my understanding is they do
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
not need a warrant to look at the list
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
that is correct this legislation was to
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
require a warrant but
 
00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
they're going in as a team to work on a
 
00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
case my understanding is they are not
 
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
on a routine basis going to look at
 
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
rosters at the hotels
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
so what I'm asking you is there couldn't
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
be a case where a bad actor a Bad Apple
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
goes in
 
00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:45.780 align:start position:0%
looking for an ex-girlfriend or ex-wife
 
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
or kids or something like that that
 
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
there couldn't be abuse of power
 
00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:59.089 --> 00:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
represent Grayson
 
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
in the discussions uh the original
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
discussions about this this bill uh
 
01:00:08.089 --> 01:00:08.099 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between a working
 
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
relationship that a motel may have with
 
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement agency obviously
 
01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.870 align:start position:0%
local law enforcement agency obviously
we

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
this is a general rule like we all want
 
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
law enforcement if there's a bad actor
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
going that is trying to seek refuge in a
 
01:00:26.809 --> 01:00:26.819 align:start position:0%
hotel uh we want the bad guy out of
 
01:00:28.849 --> 01:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
there and so having a working
 
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
relationship with the police department
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
is common sense good for business uh if
 
01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
you're known to house uh people of ill
 
01:00:36.059 --> 01:00:37.010 align:start position:0%
you're known to house uh people of ill
repute

01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
repute
 
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
your reputation gets shot and you go out
 
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
of business justifiably so
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
the difference is in compelling someone
 
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
to comply
 
01:00:49.069 --> 01:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
uh if if a law enforcement officer
 
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
tracks somebody into a motel after the
 
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
commission of a crime or it's a known
 
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
Suspect with a warrant out for their
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
arrest that's a completely different
 
01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:00.839 align:start position:0%
issue from we think there's somebody in
 
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
there we're not really sure so we're
 
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
just going to go in and take a look
 
01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
the the The
 
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
Innkeeper would have the right to say no
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
come back with a warrant
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
and then at that point in time I'll
 
01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.390 align:start position:0%
and then at that point in time I'll
comply

01:01:17.390 --> 01:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
comply
 
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
we cannot step on that right and that is
 
01:01:22.970 --> 01:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
just proper police procedure anybody who
 
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
would want to thwart that I would be
 
01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:26.700 align:start position:0%
very leery of is being a bad actor on
 
01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
the police force they should be willing
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
to go and get that get that warrant to
 
01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
compel compliance uh and so we're kind
 
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
of dealing with a bunch of different
 
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
extremes or different scenarios so what
 
01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:43.740 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to do is to compel
 
01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.670 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to do is to compel
compliance

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
requiring them to get a warrant to
 
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
compel compliance I should say but we
 
01:01:53.809 --> 01:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
should not eliminate The Innkeeper from
 
01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
voluntarily compliant and so I think the
 
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
legislation goes beyond allowing for
 
01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.710 align:start position:0%
legislation goes beyond allowing for
volunteering

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
volunteering
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
and only goes for you must get a warrant
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
in order to do this regardless so I
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
think it goes a little a little farther
 
01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
than it needs to go and Innkeeper should
 
01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
be able to comply I don't want bad guys
 
01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
in my end come and get them but at the
 
01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
same time if you want to force me to
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
comply then you have to get the warrant
 
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I I think the bill does not
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
need to be there any further legislation
 
01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
because we already have the requirement
 
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
for a warrant to compel
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
as long as we don't eliminate the
 
01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
ability of The Innkeeper to volunteer
 
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm just looking at
 
01:02:44.809 --> 01:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
the current language in law uh it says
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
that the innkeepers shall comply and if
 
01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
they're guilty of a misdemeanor so
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
there's there's a penalty if the
 
01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
Innkeeper doesn't comply
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
so I'm gonna I'm gonna move that we
 
01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
actually need to we need to address that
 
01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
I I do not like the idea of shall comply
 
01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
without a warrant
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:13.319 --> 01:03:15.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:19.020 align:start position:0%
so uh the committee uh how many people
 
01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
do you think we should have a
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this next week and and
 
01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
try to sort through this problem
 
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
okay so we will I will schedule
 
01:03:37.609 --> 01:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.619 --> 01:03:43.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman yes it occurred to me can
 
01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
I ask a question
 
01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.690 align:start position:0%
I ask a question
yes

01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:03:52.609 --> 01:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
how difficult or how long would it
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
actually take to get a warrant in a
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
situation like this
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
warrants don't take long to get
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
a couple hours I I agree with my
 
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:05.339 align:start position:0%
counterpart over there that this raises
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
some red flags with me as well and if in
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
fact the warrant is fairly easy to get I
 
01:04:14.089 --> 01:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
don't see that that's a real problem I
 
01:04:16.849 --> 01:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
think that it probably as as we look
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
into this and I'd be more than happy to
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
be on a committee that looks into this
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh I would I would put that thought
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
forward thank you so
 
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
um maybe we should just uh go with the
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
concept of recommend future legislation
 
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
and leave it at that
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay so we can still come back on okay
 
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:40.260 align:start position:0%
who would like to make that motion uh
 
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to answer the members
 
01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:48.410 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to answer the members
question

01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
yes so um I work when I worked in uh
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
road construction I worked with a lot of
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
police on detail and they would say you
 
01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
know when the issue came up
 
01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
if they needed a a search warrant while
 
01:05:01.849 --> 01:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
they pulled somebody over on the side of
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
the road they could literally just call
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
in a warrant 24 7 and have it
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
immediately if they really needed it
 
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
there was some way of getting it just on
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes should I just clarify yes
 
01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:27.349 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes should I just clarify yes
representative

01:05:27.349 --> 01:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
um thank you so um
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
with this this would be
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
I I don't know if it's representative
 
01:05:36.289 --> 01:05:36.299 align:start position:0%
Grayson or somebody would write he would
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
make a motion and then write a report
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
okay so we don't need to do a
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this though no I think I
 
01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
just realized we really don't need it
 
01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:46.619 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you I had it all wrong
 
01:05:46.619 --> 01:05:50.829 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you I had it all wrong
foreign

01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.079 --> 01:06:00.829 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
um is anybody here for the grant State
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh to repealing the Grand State Paid
 
01:06:20.450 --> 01:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
every time
 
01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:26.839 align:start position:0%
can I ask some clarification because
 
01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
this Paid Family Leave does not to in my
 
01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
eyes is not really a true Paid Family
 
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
Leave I'm not I'm not sure can can maybe
 
01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
Christy I think you know more about it
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:44.339 align:start position:0%
because I don't wanna I wanna be on
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
record that we don't we're we're in
 
01:06:50.329 --> 01:06:50.339 align:start position:0%
support of repealing or not repealing
 
01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
because I think it's very convoluted the
 
01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:55.220 align:start position:0%
bill is or the State of Affairs
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
regarding the granite state paid leave
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
do you know what it is do you know I
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
absolutely know very well what it is and
 
01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
and I see two people who walked into the
 
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
room who actually know more than I do
 
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
about the greatest Family Leave
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and you know you can the the
 
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
controversy of course is that this is a
 
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
voluntary plan uh but that we are
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
offering it to all our own state
 
01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:19.849 align:start position:0%
offering it to all our own state
employees

01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:19.859 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
so uh and that we have done a public uh
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know uh a request an RFP and to get
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
people to bid on offering this plan so
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
the question is that not whether you
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
believe or not to believe in a family
 
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
leave program and whether you want one
 
01:07:41.809 --> 01:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
to be mandatory or not mandatory what
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
this legislation was was to repeal what
 
01:07:46.609 --> 01:07:46.619 align:start position:0%
we already have in place it's already
 
01:07:51.069 --> 01:07:51.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.650 --> 01:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
it's really just a and there is some
 
01:07:58.609 --> 01:07:58.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.619 --> 01:08:02.270 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:04.630 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
it's not I I would say as someone who
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
was involved in this issue you know
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
prior that this is obviously political
 
01:08:17.329 --> 01:08:17.339 align:start position:0%
and the political was are we going to
 
01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:20.339 align:start position:0%
mandate that all employers had to
 
01:08:20.339 --> 01:08:21.650 align:start position:0%
mandate that all employers had to
provide

01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
the plan or could they in terms of
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
opting and opting out the only opting uh
 
01:08:29.209 --> 01:08:29.219 align:start position:0%
when the original bill was proposed was
 
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
whether the employee chose to
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
participate or not
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
um but that this this legislation
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
um has become political because it's
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
been accused of being an income tax
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
because it would be a tax on employees
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
so yeah so there they'll I'll invite
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
them up but I just I wanted me to make
 
01:08:54.769 --> 01:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
sure you keep an open mind
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
that we have this is our current law
 
01:09:00.289 --> 01:09:00.299 align:start position:0%
this is current law so this bill was to
 
01:09:01.669 --> 01:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
repeal it
 
01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.229 align:start position:0%
repeal it
so

01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
but this hasn't been picked up until
 
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
January 1st of 2023. we'll have who do
 
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
we have if we have the Department of
 
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
Labor and retirement Insurance who will
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
love to come up and uh and refresh
 
01:09:18.169 --> 01:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
everybody's memory about what the
 
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.249 --> 01:09:25.259 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
we are missing one of our Three Amigos
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
which is the Department of
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
administrative Services
 
01:09:34.249 --> 01:09:34.259 align:start position:0%
um I think commissioner Arley house or
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Keane will be here
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
shortly so anything uh that kind of
 
01:09:40.849 --> 01:09:40.859 align:start position:0%
Blends into their area I'll defer to
 
01:09:42.769 --> 01:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
them they should be here within the next
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
five minutes or so so just very briefly
 
01:09:46.199 --> 01:09:47.090 align:start position:0%
five minutes or so so just very briefly
um

01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
they're going to introduce themselves
 
01:09:51.410 --> 01:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
yes DJ Bettencourt Deputy Commissioner
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
of the insurance department
 
01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
Richard laver's Deputy Commissioner of
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employment security
 
01:10:01.729 --> 01:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
and so as I said between our departments
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
as well as administrative Services we
 
01:10:05.689 --> 01:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
each have a role in administering the
 
01:10:05.699 --> 01:10:06.650 align:start position:0%
each have a role in administering the
program

01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
so just to level set for everybody where
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
things are at so this Paid Family Leave
 
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
program was part of the state budget
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
that was passed last year
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
over the course of the time between that
 
01:10:23.689 --> 01:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
budget becoming law and now our
 
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
departments have been in the process of
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
procuring a insurance company to
 
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
administer that program that contract
 
01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
has been finalized the state is in
 
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
contract with MetLife
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh they are in the process now of
 
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
putting together their materials they
 
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
have submitted their rates and form
 
01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
filings to the insurance department we
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
have approved them
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
and the program will open for enrollment
 
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:57.530 --> 01:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
that pretty much covered the basics
 
01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:00.470 align:start position:0%
that pretty much covered the basics
okay

01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Bettencourt really
 
01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:05.390 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Bettencourt really
covered

01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
covered
 
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
what we've been doing from an
 
01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
operational perspective with the laws
 
01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
passed some additional aspects that
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
we've put in place
 
01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
you know we've been
 
01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
marketing the program building awareness
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
both within the employer community and
 
01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
the individual Market making sure they
 
01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
understand this is a voluntary program
 
01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
that it's available to each and all of
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
them but required of none of them we
 
01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
have our website was stood up back at
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
the beginning of September uh Paid
 
01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
Family Medical
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
leave.nh.gov we've been seeing a lot of
 
01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:46.020 align:start position:0%
traffic on that website we've
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
established profiles on all the normal
 
01:11:54.649 --> 01:11:54.659 align:start position:0%
social media platforms that you would
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
expect when you're trying to build
 
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
awareness of a program like this
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
um in partnership with MetLife they
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
conducted a series of webinars back in
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
the middle part of September they did
 
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
webinars for insurance brokers to make
 
01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
sure they understood the product they
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
did webinars for employers as well they
 
01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:17.870 align:start position:0%

employers signed up for their webinars
 
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
we have been in the process of putting
 
01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
together additional schedules of
 
01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
webinars with topics that will be
 
01:12:38.209 --> 01:12:38.219 align:start position:0%
relevant for the time right before the
 
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
the pro the program going live with
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
coverage kicking in in January 1st and
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
where MetLife stands right now from a
 
01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
quoting perspective and an activity
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
perspective they are a few months ahead
 
01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
of schedule where they are right now
 
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
with the number of inquiries they're
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
Fielding from large employers small
 
01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:59.689 align:start position:0%
Fielding from large employers small
employers

01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
um looking to get quotes for coverage
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
they are right now where they expect it
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
to be in December so activity and
 
01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:09.380 align:start position:0%
interest or building
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
and we're continuing uh to build
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
awareness for all of the groups that
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
will have the ability to to choose or
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
not to choose to have this type of
 
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
coverage come January 1st
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
and one last thing if I might Mr
 
01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
chairman one other key component and I
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
know representative Ammon has a question
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
and it's good to see you well sir
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
um the last key component for our
 
01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:36.900 align:start position:0%
department is separate and aside from
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
this program we were in the process of
 
01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
putting forward administrative rules
 
01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:43.940 align:start position:0%
related to uh Paid Family Leave programs
 
01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
there is not currently a program offered
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that has the coverage
 
01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
and structure of this current proposal
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
but there are some
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
very different skinnier plans that one
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
carrier did bring to Market which
 
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
generated our department to begin the
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
administrative rules process for those
 
01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:10.140 align:start position:0%
products that is currently going through
 
01:14:13.610 --> 01:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
the gel car process but those rules will
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
be in place if all goes well in advance
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
so I see it from administrative services
 
01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:27.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you uh
 
01:14:29.630 --> 01:14:29.640 align:start position:0%
one you could take this seat right over
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
here with the microphones because you
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
might have to talk yeah
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
is there anything you wanted to say uh
 
01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:38.219 align:start position:0%
well before we take questions or you
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
why there you go Rich did you speak to
 
01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
our implementation work
 
01:14:49.729 --> 01:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
we're covered okay rich and I work as
 
01:14:51.649 --> 01:14:51.659 align:start position:0%
partners on the project and have been
 
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
working on it very heavily since the
 
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
bill passed okay so just state your name
 
01:14:58.970 --> 01:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
and oh I'm sorry sir Catherine Keane I
 
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
am the Deputy Commissioner of the
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.649 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
great

01:15:03.649 --> 01:15:03.659 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
we've got our deputies here
 
01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
okay representative McAleer yes two
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
quick questions
 
01:15:12.169 --> 01:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
um what are the specifications are there
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
different options involved and all
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
second question is is individual
 
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
underwriting done or is this group
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
so the answer to the first question is
 
01:15:25.729 --> 01:15:25.739 align:start position:0%
that MetLife does have the flexibility
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
to go out to different businesses and
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
offer different types of
 
01:15:36.669 --> 01:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
leave in terms of a number of weeks and
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
higher wage replacement they cannot go
 
01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
below the threshold set
 
01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
in the context of health insurance you
 
01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
maybe call it the bronze plan which is
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
the six weeks 60 wage replacement they
 
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
cannot go below that but they do have
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to offer benefits that
 
01:15:57.770 --> 01:15:57.780 align:start position:0%
are more generous than that
 
01:15:59.930 --> 01:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
and then the underwriting piece the the
 
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
group the businesses will certainly be
 
01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
subject to underwriting and a question I
 
01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:07.640 align:start position:0%
get a lot is what are the rates for
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
businesses and it's a really
 
01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible question to answer
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
because it's going to go through that
 
01:16:15.649 --> 01:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
underwriting process and so if you own a
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
Logging Company your premium is going to
 
01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
be significantly different than if you
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
run a dentist office those are two very
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
different types of businesses that
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
involve very different types of risk
 
01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
but I'm assuming if you go above the
 
01:16:35.169 --> 01:16:35.179 align:start position:0%
base plan they might also do
 
01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
underwriting on the individual would
 
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
that be so the individual pool if if I'm
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
understanding your your question
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
correctly bear in mind that those rates
 
01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
are capped at five dollars per pay week
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
and so the rates that were filed by
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
MetLife to us come in right around the
 
01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
cap to a little bit below the cap there
 
01:16:55.689 --> 01:16:55.699 align:start position:0%
is some underwriting that goes on there
 
01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:58.260 align:start position:0%
but the risk you always have when you
 
01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
implement a cap with a new program is
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
that they're going to instinctively go
 
01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
to the cap which in most cases they did
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
but at five dollars per pay week that's
 
01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
a pretty inexpensive
 
01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
cost for the type of coverage that
 
01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:16.820 align:start position:0%
you're going to get
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
okay do they you know representative
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
Ammon then
 
01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking our questions good
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
to see you
 
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
um just out of my own curiosity how
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
often is the program put out to bid and
 
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
and you know how has competition
 
01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
introduced into the mix sure so it goes
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
through the regular procurement process
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
that the state undergoes so in this case
 
01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
administrative Services was the
 
01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
department that put the RFP together and
 
01:17:45.410 --> 01:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
they can speak to any of those details
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh we're currently the state is
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
currently in contract with MetLife for
 
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
five years
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
so the contract would presumably go back
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
out to bid it does have a clause that we
 
01:17:58.250 --> 01:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
can extend for two additional years at
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
the same term so we'll see how things go
 
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
that's normally what we do in our
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
procurement process
 
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
but theoretically it could be five years
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
from now yeah if
 
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
four or five years hits we'll be looking
 
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
at are we going to go back out to bid or
 
01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
are we going to be looking to extend I
 
01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
do want to say that again I just because
 
01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
I think so many people have worked on
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
this that um with regard to procurement
 
01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
nhes has been working hand in hand with
 
01:18:29.219 --> 01:18:31.490 align:start position:0%
nhes has been working hand in hand with
Das

01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
Das
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay now represent Bartlett
 
01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:42.050 align:start position:0%
okay now represent Bartlett
Joseph

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
no it's not just for state employees so
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
it's going to be offered this program
 
01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:54.530 align:start position:0%
it's going to be offered this program
they

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
they're automatically in their their
 
01:18:59.209 --> 01:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
employer is already automatically signed
 
01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
up and that and that benefit is paid for
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
the state employees are getting the
 
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
benefit paid for as they do with the
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
state is paying for it right right
 
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
okay now representative Burroughs okay
 
01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
just two quick questions which you'll be
 
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
pleased to hear that
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
um one of them is I I remember hearing
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
arguments that this program wasn't
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
sustainable but perhaps that was just
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
when it was proposed as a state program
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
I mean that's
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
I think it gives to the Chairman's
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
comments earlier I mean there's a
 
01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:33.860 align:start position:0%
certain degree of politics that has been
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
surrounding this program from the work
 
01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
that we have done we're confident that
 
01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
the program is sustainable as it's
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
currently crafted and follow-up for the
 
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:45.300 align:start position:0%
question may inquire um and the other
 
01:19:46.669 --> 01:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
thing that we haven't heard a lot of
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
what what's been the reception reception
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
to this program it sounds like it's
 
01:19:53.209 --> 01:19:53.219 align:start position:0%
pretty amazing and um you know if you
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
heard from people who want either
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
employers or or individuals who want to
 
01:19:58.669 --> 01:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
take take part in it yeah I think I
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
think Rich covered some of that our
 
01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
department receives a steady stream of
 
01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:04.250 align:start position:0%
department receives a steady stream of
interest

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
um you know I think it's important to
 
01:20:08.689 --> 01:20:08.699 align:start position:0%
remember that for a lot of particularly
 
01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
larger businesses they are self-funding
 
01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
in some cases this benefit and so now
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity for them to
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
become part of a larger program
 
01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
obviously the larger the risk pool the
 
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
better the premiums will be and then
 
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a tax credit incentive
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
as part of the program which is going to
 
01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:37.729 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

01:20:37.729 --> 01:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
uh you may have said this during your
 
01:20:42.050 --> 01:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
testimony but is are you saying that the
 
01:20:44.689 --> 01:20:44.699 align:start position:0%
the rates for those employers who choose
 
01:20:46.610 --> 01:20:46.620 align:start position:0%
to come in is it the same regardless of
 
01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
business industry so forth It's variable
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
the rates vary from one type to another
 
01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
yep it is all subject to underwriting
 
01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
so could it well could there be a huge
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
disparity between
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
you know one type of business in another
 
01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
where another faces a very high cost or
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
well maybe if there are two businesses
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
in the same industry facing a disparity
 
01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
and cost so so first of all
 
01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
um when it MetLife is quoting for a
 
01:21:13.610 --> 01:21:13.620 align:start position:0%
particular employer they're going to be
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
look at looking at the demographics of
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
the employee population for that
 
01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
employer so that's one variable another
 
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
variable is as assistant commissioner
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
Bettencourt mentioned is industry the
 
01:21:26.209 --> 01:21:26.219 align:start position:0%
industry there's a big difference
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
between working in a in a quote-unquote
 
01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
safe environment like a dentist office
 
01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
versus being in the logging industry so
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
that'll be another factor in
 
01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.750 align:start position:0%
that'll be another factor in
underwriting

01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
underwriting
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day I'll be the
 
01:21:41.810 --> 01:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
employer choosing whether they want to
 
01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:43.580 align:start position:0%
go forward with the plan or not yes
 
01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
which is critical from the original
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
legislation which was that it was
 
01:21:49.790 --> 01:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
mandatory for employers to sign up
 
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
correct and and that is absolutely right
 
01:21:54.070 --> 01:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and what makes the program
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh Universal in terms of its access is
 
01:21:59.090 --> 01:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
that if that business chooses not to
 
01:22:00.530 --> 01:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
participate in the program but there's
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
an employee that would like that
 
01:22:04.729 --> 01:22:04.739 align:start position:0%
coverage they can opt into the
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
individual pool
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
as a per right as an individual so
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
suppose group in individuals
 
01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative Grayson
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:22:17.950 --> 01:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
why would it make a difference
 
01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:20.820 align:start position:0%
who my employer is when this is paid
 
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
family medical leave
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
if I'm a logger or I'm not a logger my
 
01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
wife is a logger I could understand this
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
is paid family medical leave so her risk
 
01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
is greater than mine
 
01:22:34.729 --> 01:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
I make candy
 
01:22:36.649 --> 01:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
so my risk is lower than her she's out
 
01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
chopping trees
 
01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
so I could understand that but if I'm
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
chopping trees and she's making candy
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
why would it make a difference that I'm
 
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
the one who's chopping the trees this is
 
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
paid family medical leave not paid
 
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
medical leave let me uh if I can address
 
01:22:53.890 --> 01:22:53.900 align:start position:0%
that the the
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
with any insurance product
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
um the way I'm Sorry Charlie Arlington
 
01:22:59.450 --> 01:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of administrative
 
01:23:02.570 --> 01:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
services with any insurance product uh
 
01:23:05.209 --> 01:23:05.219 align:start position:0%
the task of the insurance company right
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure they don't lose their shirt
 
01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
is to figure out what are the risk
 
01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
factors what are the what am I likely to
 
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay out the idea is you
 
01:23:14.209 --> 01:23:14.219 align:start position:0%
know if you think about insurance that
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
goes back to Scottish widows right the
 
01:23:17.689 --> 01:23:17.699 align:start position:0%
the widows of ministers and they said
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
how many people are going to die this
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
year and we're gonna have to take care
 
01:23:21.770 --> 01:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
of the the Widow and they did a
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
calculation based on how many people are
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to die therefore how much are
 
01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:27.179 align:start position:0%
we gonna have to pay out so every factor
 
01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
is an attempt to figure out how much are
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
we likely to have to pay out as part of
 
01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
a benefit how much are we going to have
 
01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
to do there are some Industries where
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
where some injuries to you are more
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
likely and and I can figure that out
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
because I might I might be taking care
 
01:23:43.330 --> 01:23:43.340 align:start position:0%
of my knee for example
 
01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
the likelihood of what exactly happens
 
01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
with your with your spouse is harder for
 
01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
me to figure out but it's something that
 
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to get a handle on I
 
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
am also going to try to get a handle on
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
how much how much of the of wages we
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
have to replace and if you happen to be
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
insuring let's just say for the sake of
 
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
argument a law firm where people are
 
01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
making more money as opposed as opposed
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
to a different firm where people are
 
01:24:08.570 --> 01:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
making slightly less money
 
01:24:10.490 --> 01:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
um the the risk factors are part of that
 
01:24:14.090 --> 01:24:14.100 align:start position:0%
so what they're allowed to do is to
 
01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
propose rates and the set rates based on
 
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
factors those rates are end up being
 
01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
looked at by the uh by the department of
 
01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
insurance but everything that they're
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
going to do is to figure out how much
 
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to pay out so that
 
01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
they don't don't actually lose money and
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
and that's all rate setting is ever
 
01:24:32.930 --> 01:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
about is how much am I gonna have to pay
 
01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:34.870 align:start position:0%
about is how much am I gonna have to pay
out

01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:24:37.850 --> 01:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
okay representative Terry I had a
 
01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
similar question sir
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
um and in your response I heard you
 
01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
mention injuries
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
did you recall that you just mentioned
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
that in your response as one of the
 
01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:49.850 align:start position:0%
that in your response as one of the
factors

01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
factors
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
I think I might have said yeah I don't
 
01:24:53.530 --> 01:24:53.540 align:start position:0%
yeah well well transcript well you did
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
but anyway so so that's what I'm hung up
 
01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a worker's concentrate it
 
01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
had to be a home industry a home in
 
01:25:02.810 --> 01:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
injury in other words you'll hurt you
 
01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
injured yourself at home or some you
 
01:25:08.930 --> 01:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
know that rather than so this is paid
 
01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
family leave this is not about injuries
 
01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.030 align:start position:0%
family leave this is not about injuries
yes

01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.350 align:start position:0%
yes
so

01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
why would injuries be a factor in
 
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
determining the the premium rates for
 
01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
for Family Leave issues when I think a
 
01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
family leave issues the constellation in
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
current would would be well I I have a
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
sick I have a sick spouse so I need
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
family leave I have a sick child I mean
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
my wife is working full-time and and so
 
01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
I need to be at home to take care of the
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
child so without doing a risk assessment
 
01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
or maybe you are doing this or will be
 
01:25:51.410 --> 01:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
doing this a risk assessment that
 
01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:53.689 align:start position:0%
doing this a risk assessment that
involves

01:25:53.689 --> 01:25:53.699 align:start position:0%
involves
 
01:25:57.169 --> 01:25:57.179 align:start position:0%
looking at the relationships
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
that a person has who is covered under
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
Paid Family Leave
 
01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't see where injuries
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
come into play with respect to setting
 
01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:11.350 align:start position:0%
come into play with respect to setting
rates

01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
what the state has done is hired a
 
01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:16.139 align:start position:0%
company or state has contracted with a
 
01:26:17.570 --> 01:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
company or allowed a company to enter
 
01:26:19.310 --> 01:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
into the market that's an insurance
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
company that does this for a living and
 
01:26:23.209 --> 01:26:23.219 align:start position:0%
it's not me and I'm not going to figure
 
01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
out what the factors are and it's not my
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
job to figure out what the factors are I
 
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
can actually answer the question but the
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
injury was a car accident
 
01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
and they had to take to take day off to
 
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:36.780 align:start position:0%
be at the surgery
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's the family leave
 
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr chairman who who sustained
 
01:26:45.169 --> 01:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
the injury could could be either one in
 
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
other words that's if your family if
 
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
you're if your son is in a car accident
 
01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
what if it's me and if it's you that was
 
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
in the car accident yes
 
01:26:57.649 --> 01:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
and you're going to get insurance health
 
01:26:59.629 --> 01:26:59.639 align:start position:0%
insurance to pay for the surgery
 
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
but you will not get paid for work
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
because you're out of work because of
 
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
the injury
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's what the family leave will cover
 
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
you for you now will get some
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
compensation for being out of work due
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
to an injury had nothing to do with the
 
01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
employer you got into that car accident
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
all on your own but now you can apply
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.689 --> 01:27:29.699 align:start position:0%
am I right you are right Mr chairman but
 
01:27:32.689 --> 01:27:32.699 align:start position:0%
I will say I appreciate what
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative Terry is getting at and
 
01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
that there is I think some confusion in
 
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:39.420 align:start position:0%
the label of the program
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
but in this program individuals have
 
01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
first-person coverage which is to say
 
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
coverage for themselves in those
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
situations where workers comp but would
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
not come into play
 
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson and and just to
 
01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
further what you said and answer the
 
01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
question sometimes workers get injured
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
on the job and workman's comp doesn't
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
cover it uh they'll there's there's so
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
many different things that employers
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
have where they say or sorry the uh the
 
01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
insurance company says well you are
 
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
going on break or you're going to the
 
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
bathroom or you're just picking up those
 
01:28:17.930 --> 01:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
cones on their own on your own or we'll
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
say this as is linked to a pre-existing
 
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:22.500 align:start position:0%
condition or there's so many ways that
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
they can get out of just not paying
 
01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
um and so some of these reference comp
 
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
cases go on for a very long time and you
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
have medical bills accumulating right
 
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:30.950 align:start position:0%
have medical bills accumulating right
now

01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
so so if I understand this correctly Mr
 
01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
chairman while this might not
 
01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
technically be blanket coverage it
 
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
provides much broader coverage than
 
01:28:41.410 --> 01:28:41.420 align:start position:0%
would be available under working
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
example here you could have had Aflac
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
you could have had Aflac for lost of
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
anything in time but very few people buy
 
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
that product and so this is uh offering
 
01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
that benefit to
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
employers you know would want to be able
 
01:28:57.890 --> 01:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
to not feel bad about not paying their
 
01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
employee so in this way they can at
 
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
least have a insurance product for it
 
01:29:05.810 --> 01:29:05.820 align:start position:0%
well with workers comp you would have to
 
01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
be injured on the job correct
 
01:29:10.729 --> 01:29:10.739 align:start position:0%
if you are
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
driving around on your day off and
 
01:29:16.729 --> 01:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
are involved in an accident going to the
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
grocery store and you can now this work
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
because of that accident under this
 
01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:22.139 align:start position:0%
because you were going to the grocery
 
01:29:26.930 --> 01:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
do state employees get any of this I
 
01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
mean his system this is the whole state
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
employees are the foundation of this
 
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
program and this is the benefit they're
 
01:29:41.930 --> 01:29:41.940 align:start position:0%
getting and I don't have to admit when
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
we first had this was rolled out and uh
 
01:29:48.290 --> 01:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
where I first met Ridge and the
 
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
conversation was well if the premium is
 
01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
low enough the employers might just suck
 
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
it up pay them pay it themselves because
 
01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
they would want to offer it as a benefit
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
to their employees but the original
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
legislation always had that caveat that
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
an employer might opt out not to pay it
 
01:30:08.209 --> 01:30:08.219 align:start position:0%
only had to do the collection uh through
 
01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
their workers through their unemployment
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
form and that the uh the employer would
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
have the right to ask the employees to
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
pay for it but in this case uh the way
 
01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
we got this
 
01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
legislation finally passed was that
 
01:30:25.610 --> 01:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
we're using the state employees as a uh
 
01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:27.780 align:start position:0%
who this is a benefit that the state
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
negotiated with the state employees that
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
we're giving you this benefit okay and
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
that now gives the the fund the pro the
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
insurance product you know a basically
 
01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
have some you know working capital to
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
get going forward but yes it's still up
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
to an employer to choose whether they
 
01:30:46.729 --> 01:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
want to pay offered as a benefit to the
 
01:30:48.770 --> 01:30:48.780 align:start position:0%
employee or whether they would pass the
 
01:30:51.410 --> 01:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
cost on to the employee themselves okay
 
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
so so this extends a benefit to State
 
01:30:56.209 --> 01:30:56.219 align:start position:0%
Employees have into the private sector
 
01:30:59.330 --> 01:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
as an option correct the other thing was
 
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
is uh this has nothing to do with a
 
01:31:05.290 --> 01:31:05.300 align:start position:0%
maternity or leave or anything like that
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
I would say maternity is part of it yeah
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.970 --> 01:31:15.980 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah representative Abel
 
01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
I want to thank each and all of you for
 
01:31:24.290 --> 01:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
explaining this uh we as a committee
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
we've tried to pay attention but weren't
 
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
involved in everything and
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
um you've really elucidated uh something
 
01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
that is is much broader than I
 
01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
originally I thought it was
 
01:31:43.129 --> 01:31:43.139 align:start position:0%
um so I I really thank you you really
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
did a great job
 
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
um and I also can I just make a comment
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
certainly all right as a comment I want
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
to say that I haven't heard anything
 
01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
today that would indicate that there
 
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
would be a reason to uh
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
to repeal this uh this uh this law
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
and I hope there's no one else here in
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
on the committee who wants to do that so
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
that's my comment okay
 
01:32:15.709 --> 01:32:15.719 align:start position:0%
represent him thank you I just have uh
 
01:32:17.090 --> 01:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
one question
 
01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
um would this cover
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
an injury an accident or whatever that
 
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
occurred prior to taking out the
 
01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
insurance let's just say
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
um it would only cover
 
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
um injuries or accidents subsequent to
 
01:32:36.110 --> 01:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
having taken yes of the insurance yes if
 
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
I understand your question correctly it
 
01:32:40.010 --> 01:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
would be analogous to not having auto
 
01:32:42.770 --> 01:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
insurance getting in a wreck
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
calling up an insurance company saying I
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
need a policy and then putting in a
 
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
claim right
 
01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:48.530 align:start position:0%
claim right
um

01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's not allowed so if you do that you
 
01:32:52.250 --> 01:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
get a call from our fraud department and
 
01:32:54.290 --> 01:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
you don't want that and you've done a
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
good job of that this year right sadly
 
01:32:59.209 --> 01:32:59.219 align:start position:0%
sadly we've had a lot of cases over the
 
01:33:00.169 --> 01:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
past year
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative I think but um if
 
01:33:11.930 --> 01:33:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
color could buy into this program
 
01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:20.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:27.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:33:27.890 --> 01:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:27.900 --> 01:33:31.790 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:34.129 --> 01:33:34.139 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll discuss this you know I
 
01:33:35.689 --> 01:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
think at this point where we've
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
discussed this fully I don't know if
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
anybody like to be the one who makes the
 
01:33:40.209 --> 01:33:40.219 align:start position:0%
motion to bring It Forward
 
01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:45.239 --> 01:33:49.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
all right uh past 11 30. all right
 
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
requiring employer to provide reasonable
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
is anybody here to uh
 
01:34:04.729 --> 01:34:04.739 align:start position:0%
participate in the discussion on this
 
01:34:04.739 --> 01:34:07.430 align:start position:0%
participate in the discussion on this
legislation

01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.649 --> 01:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
representative Abramson yeah I made a
 
01:34:11.649 --> 01:34:11.659 align:start position:0%
point on this bill
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
during executive session where I said
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
that the only example that I could think
 
01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:17.930 align:start position:0%
that the only example that I could think
of

01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:34:20.810 --> 01:34:20.820 align:start position:0%
where employers are moving around was in
 
01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
road construction where I'd worked
 
01:34:22.199 --> 01:34:22.930 align:start position:0%
road construction where I'd worked
before

01:34:22.930 --> 01:34:22.940 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh since then I now work in tech support
 
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
and I work with a lot of different
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
people who move around the state move
 
01:34:31.129 --> 01:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
from place to place
 
01:34:31.139 --> 01:34:32.149 align:start position:0%
from place to place
um

01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:32.159 --> 01:34:33.410 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh it it appeared to me that you know
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
State mandates unfunded mandates they're
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
inflexible they don't allow for
 
01:34:44.810 --> 01:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
exceptions and when we have tried to put
 
01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
in a process for allowing exceptions
 
01:34:51.050 --> 01:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
um it ended up being another kind of
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
hardship to create for certain types of
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
businesses and in road construction in
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
particular some of the some of the
 
01:34:57.890 --> 01:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
companies are pretty small they only
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
have one or two trucks and to require
 
01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
that they drag a trailer along behind
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
them was well the the unfunded mandate
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
issue definitely came up when it came to
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:35:12.530 --> 01:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
um there turns out that they are one of
 
01:35:19.090 --> 01:35:19.100 align:start position:0%
the uh biggest complaints or the biggest
 
01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
claims that have been made the teachers
 
01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
were not getting proper accommodation
 
01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
and and I have a real life story with my
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
my daughter uh where they were you know
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
they said okay if you don't want the
 
01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:33.659 align:start position:0%
bathroom they they offered a closet
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
and said you can go ahead and you do it
 
01:35:41.330 --> 01:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
right right well they're pregnant was
 
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
this was okay this was the time you need
 
01:35:47.689 --> 01:35:47.699 align:start position:0%
three hour you need a break every half
 
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
hour every every three hours you needed
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
that's pregnant this is pregnant
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
was the Mandate of mandating time off
 
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
that you had to have time that there was
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
I thought it was okay well what was the
 
01:36:12.649 --> 01:36:12.659 align:start position:0%
issue then what's what's why what was
 
01:36:12.659 --> 01:36:14.629 align:start position:0%
issue then what's what's why what was
the

01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:36:23.629 --> 01:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.639 --> 01:36:26.270 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.490 --> 01:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
but I thought that even the pregnant was
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
the three ever half hour every three
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
hours is anybody
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
remember I don't know you want to pull
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:51.110 --> 01:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
right okay so in this one there was the
 
01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
language of when that the employer or
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
the how long the employee can stay
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
with the employer
 
01:37:02.689 --> 01:37:02.699 align:start position:0%
and then they then they can then
 
01:37:02.699 --> 01:37:04.910 align:start position:0%
and then they then they can then
leave

01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
leave
 
01:37:07.129 --> 01:37:07.139 align:start position:0%
and the employer had to guarantee that
 
01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
they would have a job when they came
 
01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:10.610 align:start position:0%
they would have a job when they came
back

01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
but that the issue was was the employer
 
01:37:21.110 --> 01:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
right I remember there was two different
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
bills I don't know what happened I guess
 
01:37:27.649 --> 01:37:27.659 align:start position:0%
we it
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
I mean itl the other one
 
01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:31.430 align:start position:0%
I mean itl the other one
so

01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.030 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:34.250 --> 01:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
I guess that in terms of what I think
 
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
the issue was you know was employers
 
01:37:39.290 --> 01:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
really not accommodating employees were
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
they not and how do you how do you
 
01:37:42.770 --> 01:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
decide what is reasonable compensation
 
01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
then you're going to get the state
 
01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:45.470 align:start position:0%
then you're going to get the state
involved

01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me reasonable accommodating
 
01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:51.229 align:start position:0%
excuse me reasonable accommodating
accommodating

01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
accommodating
 
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
that the employer says I refuse to give
 
01:37:57.770 --> 01:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:57.780 --> 01:38:01.790 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire
 
01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner the director of the New
 
01:38:08.689 --> 01:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Commission on human rights Not
 
01:38:10.729 --> 01:38:10.739 align:start position:0%
Human Rights right yeah I remember yeah
 
01:38:10.739 --> 01:38:12.110 align:start position:0%
Human Rights right yeah I remember yeah
Ani

01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
Ani
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
right she had she was here for both
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
bills right exactly um you know usually
 
01:38:18.890 --> 01:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
it goes to them first
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
um and they try to work with the
 
01:38:21.770 --> 01:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
employer because they
 
01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
their aim is not to go to court on it
 
01:38:27.649 --> 01:38:27.659 align:start position:0%
um and for the most part that usually
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
works out the bill was to mandate that
 
01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
employers need to work with an employer
 
01:38:37.729 --> 01:38:37.739 align:start position:0%
the employee that is pregnant
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
and make reasonable accommodations so
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
they can continue to work
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
and the opposition was
 
01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:46.139 align:start position:0%
um that they didn't want there to be a
 
01:38:48.110 --> 01:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
mandate period right because of the
 
01:38:49.610 --> 01:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
awkwardness of trying to intervene
 
01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
between that employer employee
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
relationship wanted to continue
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
um to study this felt that women
 
01:38:59.870 --> 01:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
are those that you know young women are
 
01:39:01.729 --> 01:39:01.739 align:start position:0%
the ones that get pregnant and they're
 
01:39:03.410 --> 01:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
the ones that
 
01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
want to be able to keep their jobs many
 
01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
employees we had testimony for many
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
employers that said
 
01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.189 align:start position:0%
employers that said
um

01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:14.030 --> 01:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
yes it's a good idea but others were
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
saying well I want to work with my own
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
employees and I um don't want it to be
 
01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:19.370 align:start position:0%
employees and I um don't want it to be
mandated

01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
the other issue came up regarding
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
keeping the job open and whether there
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
were complications pregnancy and how
 
01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:28.870 align:start position:0%
were complications pregnancy and how
long

01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
long
 
01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
that job could be
 
01:39:33.890 --> 01:39:33.900 align:start position:0%
made available to the
 
01:39:36.890 --> 01:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
um postpartum
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
employee right so we didn't kill it we
 
01:39:44.090 --> 01:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
went we brought it to interim study the
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
other bill was killed in committee
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
conference right okay yes
 
01:39:53.450 --> 01:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Johnson was first
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so I I remember this um one of
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
the one most employees want to work with
 
01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
their employees want to work with the
 
01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:06.890 align:start position:0%
their employees want to work with the
employees

01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
um I did a lot of talking to several
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
several you know employers
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
um and if it does come an issue they go
 
01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
to the human rights and they can usually
 
01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
work it out in one of the biggest things
 
01:40:21.530 --> 01:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
I had a problem with this bill was
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
um saying that if you are pregnant it's
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
a disability I'm sorry that is I mean I
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
can understand there's medical problems
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
that come up with a pregnancy I get that
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
but being pregnant is not a disability
 
01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
and as a as a woman I find that very
 
01:40:38.689 --> 01:40:38.699 align:start position:0%
offensive that because I was pregnant I
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
I couldn't do something and I was you
 
01:40:42.590 --> 01:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
know a disabled because I was pregnant
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
it just to me it was
 
01:40:47.270 --> 01:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
um putting a label on something that
 
01:40:49.010 --> 01:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
didn't need to be put a label on I think
 
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
this is an unnecessary bill I think it's
 
01:40:54.350 --> 01:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
already being worked out privately and
 
01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:55.070 align:start position:0%
already being worked out privately and
um

01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:57.890 --> 01:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
that's why I recommend that this bill
 
01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative I just wanted so this is
 
01:41:07.129 --> 01:41:07.139 align:start position:0%
a short Bill all it would do in law is
 
01:41:07.139 --> 01:41:08.209 align:start position:0%
a short Bill all it would do in law is
repeal

01:41:08.209 --> 01:41:08.219 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
the sentence that says an employer shall
 
01:41:11.930 --> 01:41:11.940 align:start position:0%
permit a female employee to take a leave
 
01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
of absence for the period of temporary
 
01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
physical disability resulting from
 
01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
pregnancy childbirth or other related
 
01:41:20.090 --> 01:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
medical conditions and then it adds an
 
01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
employer shall provide reasonable
 
01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
accommodations and or permit a female
 
01:41:25.129 --> 01:41:25.139 align:start position:0%
employee to take a leave of absence for
 
01:41:26.090 --> 01:41:26.100 align:start position:0%
a period of temporary physical
 
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
disability resulting from pregnancy
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
childbirth or related medical conditions
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
unless such employer can demonstrate
 
01:41:34.010 --> 01:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
that the accommodation would impose an
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
undue hardship on the operation of the
 
01:41:37.310 --> 01:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
employer's business
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
when an employee is physically able to
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
return to work her job or a comparable
 
01:41:43.850 --> 01:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
position shall be made available to her
 
01:41:46.189 --> 01:41:46.199 align:start position:0%
by the employer unless business
 
01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
necessity makes this impossible or
 
01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
unreasonable I do work by the way with a
 
01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
co-worker who is pregnant right away and
 
01:41:57.050 --> 01:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
she will she'll take her leave when it's
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
time to give birth and she plans to come
 
01:42:02.209 --> 01:42:02.219 align:start position:0%
back when she's able to so
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
right so if I understand the difference
 
01:42:07.129 --> 01:42:07.139 align:start position:0%
uh between the current law and this new
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
language is that the employee can come
 
01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
and go
 
01:42:13.910 --> 01:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
they can take a day or take days off and
 
01:42:16.669 --> 01:42:16.679 align:start position:0%
then come back whereas the current law
 
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
simply says when there's time to go
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
you're gone until after you've had the
 
01:42:23.209 --> 01:42:23.219 align:start position:0%
baby well it's it's another one where
 
01:42:25.790 --> 01:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's you know do we ask employers to do
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
this or do we you know find them heavily
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
if they're not able to do it and I'm I'm
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
saying I'd rather program default
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
personally I'd rather programs be
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
voluntarily voluntary going back in our
 
01:42:36.719 --> 01:42:37.669 align:start position:0%
voluntarily voluntary going back in our
history

01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
um for about 100 years the Republican
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
approach on employee employer relations
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
Is we try to create more jobs than there
 
01:42:46.010 --> 01:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
are people to fill them limit
 
01:42:47.450 --> 01:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
immigration and create a healthy
 
01:42:49.070 --> 01:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
business environment so that the workers
 
01:42:50.689 --> 01:42:50.699 align:start position:0%
themselves can choose
 
01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
all of the different things they want if
 
01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
they want more pay or more benefits or
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
they want more flexible work conditions
 
01:42:58.129 --> 01:42:58.139 align:start position:0%
that we leave it up to the employee that
 
01:43:00.410 --> 01:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
we just create an abundance of jobs in
 
01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
the marketplace that's kind of been our
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
approach I think that might even be in
 
01:43:05.450 --> 01:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Republican platform
 
01:43:07.609 --> 01:43:07.619 align:start position:0%
but that's at least for 100 years at
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
least since Calvin Coolidge that's been
 
01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
kind of our approach let the worker
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
decide what type of employer they want
 
01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
representative creason
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:21.350 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
another issue that I see in the current
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
legislation is that there's no
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility on the employee in
 
01:43:32.330 --> 01:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
communicating with her employer as to
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
what her intentions are at what point in
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
time after she has taken her leave of
 
01:43:39.290 --> 01:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
absence she decides or doesn't decide to
 
01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
come back how long does he or she the
 
01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
employer have to wait on her to make up
 
01:43:47.209 --> 01:43:47.219 align:start position:0%
her mind and you know to fill that
 
01:43:49.250 --> 01:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
Slaughter not fill that slot so there's
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
nothing addressing any responsibility on
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
her part uh and I I honestly I don't
 
01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:56.639 align:start position:0%
know how this is even a significant
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
issue in the marketplace where employers
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
are not willing to accommodate their
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
employees other than as you pointed out
 
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
the biggest offender is the school
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
system and so that's something that can
 
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
be done without legislation uh
 
01:44:18.490 --> 01:44:18.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs thank you um
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
maybe some more comments you know like
 
01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
I do think that a lot of businesses have
 
01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
human resources and they will be you
 
01:44:29.209 --> 01:44:29.219 align:start position:0%
know if they want to keep their people
 
01:44:30.649 --> 01:44:30.659 align:start position:0%
they're going to want to accommodate
 
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
them but I think of businesses like
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
these big nail salons where
 
01:44:39.649 --> 01:44:39.659 align:start position:0%
um people don't feel empowered to be
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
able to to ask for or get what they need
 
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
and those are the scenarios I think that
 
01:44:47.209 --> 01:44:47.219 align:start position:0%
we need to be concerned about and um you
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
know I I no disrespect um representative
 
01:44:51.169 --> 01:44:51.179 align:start position:0%
Abramson you know he talked about the
 
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
Republican platform but you know this is
 
01:44:56.209 --> 01:44:56.219 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan committee so
 
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
there's other there's other points of
 
01:44:59.930 --> 01:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
view I I mean no disrespect by saying
 
01:45:01.129 --> 01:45:01.139 align:start position:0%
that to you
 
01:45:04.490 --> 01:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
so so the question is that a large
 
01:45:07.149 --> 01:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
employer like a nail salon
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
I know there's a question about some of
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
those employees and and uh with their
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I did so notwithstanding that fact
 
01:45:19.850 --> 01:45:19.860 align:start position:0%
the issue I guess what I'm hearing is
 
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:22.860 align:start position:0%
that what this legislation was attended
 
01:45:25.490 --> 01:45:25.500 align:start position:0%
was that an employee would say I'm not
 
01:45:28.490 --> 01:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
coming in today because I have
 
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
pregnancy issues but I want to come in
 
01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:32.930 align:start position:0%
pregnancy issues but I want to come in
tomorrow

01:45:32.930 --> 01:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
but under the current law you stay as
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
long as you can
 
01:45:40.250 --> 01:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
and then you tell the employer or you
 
01:45:42.649 --> 01:45:42.659 align:start position:0%
now need to find a replacement for me
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
but what this bill says is now the onus
 
01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
is on the employer to have to be
 
01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:53.270 align:start position:0%
is on the employer to have to be
flexible

01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
flexible
 
01:45:56.209 --> 01:45:56.219 align:start position:0%
that on any given day the employee may
 
01:45:58.490 --> 01:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
or may not come in
 
01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
if I could just offer a scenario again I
 
01:46:03.649 --> 01:46:03.659 align:start position:0%
I don't have biological children I got
 
01:46:06.830 --> 01:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
bonus kids through my husband but um you
 
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
know if a woman's really let's say
 
01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
there's she's really nauseous you know
 
01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
and she's just feeling so sick she can't
 
01:46:15.950 --> 01:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
come in that day does that mean that she
 
01:46:17.689 --> 01:46:17.699 align:start position:0%
you know she's going to lose her job if
 
01:46:19.310 --> 01:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
she doesn't ask for that accommodation
 
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming
 
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
is that most employers
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
are hungry to hold on to all employees
 
01:46:29.689 --> 01:46:29.699 align:start position:0%
they can and they would absolutely
 
01:46:32.689 --> 01:46:32.699 align:start position:0%
accommodate them but that the way the
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know the the issue of the current
 
01:46:36.530 --> 01:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
law and I assume the way the the current
 
01:46:39.169 --> 01:46:39.179 align:start position:0%
law was written this way was an employer
 
01:46:40.729 --> 01:46:40.739 align:start position:0%
saying is if you're going to take off
 
01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
because you're pregnant
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
take off maybe if you're that close
 
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.179 align:start position:0%
you've got the issues I need to find
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
someone else to replace you I.E school
 
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:51.410 align:start position:0%
someone else to replace you I.E school
districts

01:46:51.410 --> 01:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:46:53.689 --> 01:46:53.699 align:start position:0%
I need to find that replacement we've
 
01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
got to figure out how we're going to
 
01:46:57.350 --> 01:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
replace you but to have to deal with
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
that that you could be here today or not
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
tomorrow or back and forth that
 
01:47:04.370 --> 01:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
flexibility that the law this bill is
 
01:47:06.770 --> 01:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
attempting to create is putting the
 
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
burden is a burden to the to the
 
01:47:12.169 --> 01:47:12.179 align:start position:0%
employer perhaps a compromise might be
 
01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
to do to to look at this the way that we
 
01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:15.350 align:start position:0%
to do to to look at this the way that we
do

01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:47:17.450 --> 01:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm sick leave that there be
 
01:47:19.729 --> 01:47:19.739 align:start position:0%
additional days for pregnancy something
 
01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
like that might be something we look at
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
down the road I I wouldn't hope school
 
01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
districts have that don't they I don't
 
01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
know I I would assume they have that
 
01:47:33.770 --> 01:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
yeah but in terms of to mandate that the
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
the nail salon have a policy I mean you
 
01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:39.530 align:start position:0%
the nail salon have a policy I mean you
know

01:47:39.530 --> 01:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative Abel
 
01:47:44.570 --> 01:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
I bet you can guess what I'll say
 
01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:46.609 align:start position:0%
I bet you can guess what I'll say
um

01:47:46.609 --> 01:47:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.149 --> 01:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
I think that the objections brought up
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
are important to consider but I don't
 
01:47:56.169 --> 01:47:56.179 align:start position:0%
think any of them are
 
01:48:02.030 --> 01:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
so grave that uh with a little time they
 
01:48:06.310 --> 01:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't all be solved
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure that this bill will be or a
 
01:48:13.370 --> 01:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
similar bill will be coming up in the
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
new uh in the new session
 
01:48:20.930 --> 01:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
um and I think that it would be right
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
for us to uh suggest that uh
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
future recommend future legislation
 
01:48:33.890 --> 01:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
saying that that the current bill needed
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
some tweaking
 
01:48:37.490 --> 01:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
um and that the idea
 
01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
of it is is important and to tell uh
 
01:48:45.669 --> 01:48:45.679 align:start position:0%
our female and male
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
citizens that uh that this is that we
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
recognize this as a significant issue
 
01:48:54.649 --> 01:48:54.659 align:start position:0%
and perhaps and
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sure three of us can sit down and
 
01:48:59.330 --> 01:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
could fix this bill so
 
01:49:01.970 --> 01:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
um I would I would like to argue that or
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
urge us to uh to recommend uh future
 
01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.330 align:start position:0%
urge us to uh to recommend uh future
legislation

01:49:08.330 --> 01:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bartlett thank
 
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um we don't have the option
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
of recommending an amendment so we don't
 
01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
have that option
 
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
um I think that all of us are at a
 
01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
disadvantage because we don't have our
 
01:49:22.250 --> 01:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
files in front of us with the testimony
 
01:49:25.070 --> 01:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
of those that have been affected both
 
01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:26.689 align:start position:0%
of those that have been affected both
sides

01:49:26.689 --> 01:49:26.699 align:start position:0%
sides
 
01:49:29.570 --> 01:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
um um on this bill and I have to admit I
 
01:49:31.609 --> 01:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
don't have the file anymore
 
01:49:31.619 --> 01:49:32.570 align:start position:0%
don't have the file anymore
um

01:49:32.570 --> 01:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
but I am going to I will be on the side
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
of recommending future legislation on
 
01:49:40.490 --> 01:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
this one fair enough
 
01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:42.590 align:start position:0%
this one fair enough
representative

01:49:42.590 --> 01:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:49:44.390 --> 01:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
just to add to that um
 
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
if if we decide not to recommend
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
certainly an individual estate
 
01:49:52.129 --> 01:49:52.139 align:start position:0%
representative state legislator
 
01:49:54.770 --> 01:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
absolutely you can bring this bill in a
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
bill so everything we're just doing
 
01:49:58.430 --> 01:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
today and tomorrow is basically
 
01:50:00.189 --> 01:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
discussing whether
 
01:50:03.169 --> 01:50:03.179 align:start position:0%
going forward if some that bill comes in
 
01:50:05.209 --> 01:50:05.219 align:start position:0%
someone can say this is what the
 
01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee did in its last
 
01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:09.169 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee did in its last
action

01:50:09.169 --> 01:50:09.179 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:50:09.179 --> 01:50:13.010 align:start position:0%
action
representative

01:50:13.010 --> 01:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.570 --> 01:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to point out there's
 
01:50:16.609 --> 01:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
a principle that kind of relates to the
 
01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
previous bill that we considered and the
 
01:50:21.770 --> 01:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
magic word was voluntary so
 
01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
we as state legislators we can we can
 
01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
dictate what state employees are
 
01:50:29.870 --> 01:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
required to receive
 
01:50:32.209 --> 01:50:32.219 align:start position:0%
uh similar to the Paid Family Leave
 
01:50:35.330 --> 01:50:35.340 align:start position:0%
program but leave it up to the private
 
01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
employers to implement it voluntarily
 
01:50:39.770 --> 01:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
that's sort of like the main principle
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
from the fame the Paid Family Leave bill
 
01:50:42.239 --> 01:50:43.129 align:start position:0%
from the fame the Paid Family Leave bill
so

01:50:43.129 --> 01:50:43.139 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:45.290 --> 01:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good
 
01:50:49.250 --> 01:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.260 --> 01:50:50.689 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:50:50.689 --> 01:50:50.699 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
all right so uh representative Johnson
 
01:50:55.129 --> 01:50:55.139 align:start position:0%
is going to bring forward the motion of
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
not recommended for future legislation
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
on to the last but not least and I see
 
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
Senator bertel is here
 
01:51:10.490 --> 01:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
just in time
 
01:51:13.370 --> 01:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
okay requiring online marketplaces to
 
01:51:14.750 --> 01:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
disclose certain information to
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
Consumers uh
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm kind of well I understand why
 
01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
but I was looking for Curtis Berry
 
01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:23.219 align:start position:0%
because he made a he and I made a bet
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
about how many other states were going
 
01:51:28.490 --> 01:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
to pass this legislation but but uh so
 
01:51:31.010 --> 01:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
does anybody know how how many states
 
01:51:32.930 --> 01:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
passed this legislation yet why don't
 
01:51:39.290 --> 01:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
well we're not testifying we're not
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
speaking we're having a conversation
 
01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
but you can come up Jim if you want to
 
01:51:49.850 --> 01:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:52.490 --> 01:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
we would never hold you back you
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh good morning Mr chair I am not Curtis
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
Berry but I am Curtis Picard so I don't
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
know that was close enough right
 
01:52:00.290 --> 01:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
um and I'm the new head of New Hampshire
 
01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:03.410 align:start position:0%
um and I'm the new head of New Hampshire
correct

01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
um 13 states now have passed uh this
 
01:52:07.490 --> 01:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
legislation California being the most
 
01:52:09.649 --> 01:52:09.659 align:start position:0%
recent which uh was signed by the
 
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
governor I think within the last two
 
01:52:13.490 --> 01:52:13.500 align:start position:0%
weeks okay okay
 
01:52:15.410 --> 01:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
great so I would have lost the bet if
 
01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:17.540 align:start position:0%
Curtis was here again
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair Mr chair how many what was it
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
only 12 states that passed it at the
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
time when we took this legislation right
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
so it was only I think it was one stage
 
01:52:28.850 --> 01:52:28.860 align:start position:0%
it was only a couple months ago yeah it
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
was only one state California right okay
 
01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
may we have the the other 12 States
 
01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:34.970 align:start position:0%
may we have the the other 12 States
please

01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
so what are yeah
 
01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
what are all the states that passed this
 
01:52:40.729 --> 01:52:40.739 align:start position:0%
I know that Arkansas was the first with
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
the with the permission of the chair I
 
01:52:44.330 --> 01:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
have a map that okay that's good you got
 
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative Johnson get our
 
01:52:59.689 --> 01:52:59.699 align:start position:0%
refresher on this one because I'm kind
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
of fuzzy okay so this one was to add
 
01:53:06.910 --> 01:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
into our consumer protection statute
 
01:53:09.169 --> 01:53:09.179 align:start position:0%
that a
 
01:53:09.179 --> 01:53:11.090 align:start position:0%
that a
um

01:53:11.090 --> 01:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
a complaint could be filed to the
 
01:53:16.490 --> 01:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office
 
01:53:20.050 --> 01:53:20.060 align:start position:0%
that the Attorney General then contact
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
the company that was selling the product
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
the enter the online platform
 
01:53:29.930 --> 01:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
that was selling the product to ask them
 
01:53:33.770 --> 01:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
to do a background check on the actual
 
01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:34.970 align:start position:0%
to do a background check on the actual
vendor

01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:34.980 align:start position:0%
vendor
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
that was supplying the product to the
 
01:53:38.639 --> 01:53:39.950 align:start position:0%
that was supplying the product to the
consumer

01:53:39.950 --> 01:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
do I get that right
 
01:53:45.649 --> 01:53:45.659 align:start position:0%
not exactly this would mandate that the
 
01:53:48.649 --> 01:53:48.659 align:start position:0%
Online Marketplace platform would have
 
01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
to verify right but but the customer
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
before they could go on to the platform
 
01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
or our seller I should say seller so
 
01:53:59.330 --> 01:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't petition the AG they would
 
01:54:01.330 --> 01:54:01.340 align:start position:0%
actually I thought the AG had to contact
 
01:54:05.090 --> 01:54:05.100 align:start position:0%
the online platform to tell them that
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
have you done your background check on
 
01:54:10.070 --> 01:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
this particular vendor so the AE would
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
be be the enforcement agency and if a
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
complaint was waged against the platform
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
for not verifying the AG would then
 
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
enforce the chapter right but that would
 
01:54:25.129 --> 01:54:25.139 align:start position:0%
be the only time the AG would step in so
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
it would be a mandatory requirement
 
01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:31.860 align:start position:0%
that the platform would have to verify
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
who is going on their platforms and and
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
who the vendors are who the third party
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
vendors are correct and and just so just
 
01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
to kind of reset why that was the case
 
01:54:45.290 --> 01:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
is I think we have found and we're
 
01:54:48.169 --> 01:54:48.179 align:start position:0%
seeing evidence that
 
01:54:49.850 --> 01:54:49.860 align:start position:0%
um this is the sort of the modern
 
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
technique of selling stolen property and
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
counterfeit property and it's extremely
 
01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:56.750 align:start position:0%
counterfeit property and it's extremely
difficult

01:54:56.750 --> 01:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement to go after uh these
 
01:55:02.930 --> 01:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
third-party sellers when they haven't
 
01:55:05.930 --> 01:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
been verified they open an account for a
 
01:55:08.209 --> 01:55:08.219 align:start position:0%
week sell their product disappear and
 
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
there's no recourse to go after them and
 
01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
so this has been become a very high
 
01:55:17.090 --> 01:55:17.100 align:start position:0%
priority for both the small and large
 
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
members of the retail association but
 
01:55:22.970 --> 01:55:22.980 align:start position:0%
just as a refresher
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
Pharma is a strong Advocate and the the
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
consumer health care products
 
01:55:31.370 --> 01:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
Association are strong advocates for
 
01:55:33.410 --> 01:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
this as well because they are seeing
 
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
counterfeit medications and counterfeit
 
01:55:38.450 --> 01:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
health care products finding their way
 
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
onto these sites where they're being
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
harmed and people are being harmed by
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
the products and the New Hampshire
 
01:55:47.330 --> 01:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
Police Association you might remember
 
01:55:50.450 --> 01:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
testified in sport because they see this
 
01:55:52.850 --> 01:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
as a two-step approach to dealing with
 
01:55:54.590 --> 01:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
these problems one
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
it will prevent many of the Bad actors
 
01:56:03.290 --> 01:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
from ever getting on the marketplace so
 
01:56:05.209 --> 01:56:05.219 align:start position:0%
the stolen products or counterfeit
 
01:56:05.219 --> 01:56:06.290 align:start position:0%
the stolen products or counterfeit
products

01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:06.300 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:56:09.169 --> 01:56:09.179 align:start position:0%
never make their way to Consumers and
 
01:56:12.290 --> 01:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
second if they do because the platform
 
01:56:14.090 --> 01:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
has verified
 
01:56:17.930 --> 01:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
who the seller is they now have
 
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
information to be able to do their job
 
01:56:25.010 --> 01:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
and go after uh the Bad actors so those
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
are some of the reasons why this has
 
01:56:28.970 --> 01:56:28.980 align:start position:0%
become you know such a high priority for
 
01:56:30.530 --> 01:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
all of these groups and I think Curtis
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
even has some pictures that shows
 
01:56:36.050 --> 01:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
some of the online products that are
 
01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
being sold that appear to be stolen
 
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.729 align:start position:0%
being sold that appear to be stolen
products

01:56:40.729 --> 01:56:40.739 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:56:44.090 --> 01:56:44.100 align:start position:0%
um that came from Merchants where they
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
were stolen from some of the retailers
 
01:56:49.609 --> 01:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
and are being sold without verification
 
01:56:53.689 --> 01:56:53.699 align:start position:0%
of who the individual is selling these
 
01:56:53.699 --> 01:56:55.270 align:start position:0%
of who the individual is selling these
products

01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
products
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair these pictures were from
 
01:56:59.450 --> 01:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
this morning I went on one of the
 
01:57:01.850 --> 01:57:01.860 align:start position:0%
marketplaces and searched 40 miles of
 
01:57:04.189 --> 01:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
within Concord and if you see from the
 
01:57:05.930 --> 01:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
photos you'll see some power tools
 
01:57:08.510 --> 01:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
multiple power tools being offered for
 
01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:09.890 align:start position:0%
multiple power tools being offered for
sale

01:57:09.890 --> 01:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
sale
 
01:57:11.629 --> 01:57:11.639 align:start position:0%
um you know one of the things that that
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
we talk about in the retail association
 
01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:14.330 align:start position:0%
we talk about in the retail association
of

01:57:14.330 --> 01:57:14.340 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:57:16.490 --> 01:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
things we look for for things that could
 
01:57:19.689 --> 01:57:19.699 align:start position:0%
potentially be stolen goods is new inbox
 
01:57:22.850 --> 01:57:22.860 align:start position:0%
unopened packaging in original packaging
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
those types of things or multiples of
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
the same product and so in this case
 
01:57:29.450 --> 01:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
here you're seeing some Ryobi uh
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
chainsaws Ryobi is a private brand label
 
01:57:35.450 --> 01:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
for Home Depot you can only buy Ryobi
 
01:57:38.330 --> 01:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
tools at Home Depot for example yet here
 
01:57:42.169 --> 01:57:42.179 align:start position:0%
is a individual supposedly selling these
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
items online in multiples and if you go
 
01:57:47.810 --> 01:57:47.820 align:start position:0%
to the second page you'll see the seller
 
01:57:50.450 --> 01:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
has no ratings whatsoever so I don't
 
01:57:52.490 --> 01:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
know who this person is I don't know if
 
01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
these items are stolen but these are the
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
types of things that would raise a red
 
01:57:58.910 --> 01:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
flag with any retailer or organized
 
01:58:01.970 --> 01:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
retail crime investigator the other one
 
01:58:04.729 --> 01:58:04.739 align:start position:0%
is a bunch of string trimmers also
 
01:58:07.129 --> 01:58:07.139 align:start position:0%
another seller without ratings as well
 
01:58:09.410 --> 01:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
and this is what I found within 30
 
01:58:11.810 --> 01:58:11.820 align:start position:0%
seconds of going online this morning you
 
01:58:13.729 --> 01:58:13.739 align:start position:0%
can search things like Crest White
 
01:58:18.109 --> 01:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
Strips Prilosec baby formula Gillette
 
01:58:19.850 --> 01:58:19.860 align:start position:0%
razors these are the items that are most
 
01:58:22.189 --> 01:58:22.199 align:start position:0%
commonly stolen because you can sell you
 
01:58:24.050 --> 01:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
can steal multiples of them at once you
 
01:58:26.330 --> 01:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
can wipe out a whole shelf and they're
 
01:58:28.729 --> 01:58:28.739 align:start position:0%
also a high cost item where you can
 
01:58:31.669 --> 01:58:31.679 align:start position:0%
regain now nowadays online about 90
 
01:58:34.129 --> 01:58:34.139 align:start position:0%
percent of the retail value by selling
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
it online so 90 pure profit for the bad
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
Sellers and basically what we're looking
 
01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
for for is every brick and mortar
 
01:58:43.729 --> 01:58:43.739 align:start position:0%
retailer in New Hampshire is registered
 
01:58:45.290 --> 01:58:45.300 align:start position:0%
with the state in some way you know who
 
01:58:47.390 --> 01:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
the owner is you know their address you
 
01:58:49.609 --> 01:58:49.619 align:start position:0%
know their phone number all we're asking
 
01:58:51.410 --> 01:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
for is that if you are a professional
 
01:58:54.169 --> 01:58:54.179 align:start position:0%
seller online selling Goods that you
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
provide similar information that every
 
01:58:58.370 --> 01:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar retailer already does
 
01:58:59.390 --> 01:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:59:01.609 --> 01:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
that's basically what this bill does Mr
 
01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr chairman
 
01:59:06.290 --> 01:59:06.300 align:start position:0%
question representative Terry thank you
 
01:59:10.430 --> 01:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:12.890 --> 01:59:12.900 align:start position:0%
the longer that you two gentlemen have
 
01:59:15.229 --> 01:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
uh spoken and uh
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
enlightened us as to what's going on the
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
more questions occur to me about um
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
I I will I will confine my questions to
 
01:59:26.270 --> 01:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
two at this point because lunch is in
 
01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:27.250 align:start position:0%
two at this point because lunch is in
view

01:59:27.250 --> 01:59:27.260 align:start position:0%
view
 
01:59:30.649 --> 01:59:30.659 align:start position:0%
uh number one
 
01:59:34.430 --> 01:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
these uh these uh sellers uh this is
 
01:59:36.229 --> 01:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
this is obviously a case of interstate
 
01:59:36.239 --> 01:59:37.669 align:start position:0%
this is obviously a case of interstate
commerce

01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
with these illustrations unless you're
 
01:59:42.350 --> 01:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
going to tell me that these uh sellers
 
01:59:44.570 --> 01:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
are only selling within the state of
 
01:59:46.189 --> 01:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
they're located in New Hampshire and
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
selling within New Hampshire would it be
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
accurate to say as the first part of my
 
01:59:53.629 --> 01:59:53.639 align:start position:0%
question that that we that you can say
 
01:59:55.729 --> 01:59:55.739 align:start position:0%
that these entities are involved in
 
01:59:57.350 --> 01:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce
 
01:59:59.810 --> 01:59:59.820 align:start position:0%
they were attempting to they possibly
 
02:00:02.930 --> 02:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
could I searched 40 miles of Concord to
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
try to find some you know potential
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
sellers that are selling within New
 
02:00:07.199 --> 02:00:08.229 align:start position:0%
sellers that are selling within New
Hampshire

02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
the reason that I ask
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
is uh even though I'm a big advocate of
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
states rights under the Constitution
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
if if if if this is happening with
 
02:00:23.450 --> 02:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
sellers selling across state lines and
 
02:00:25.910 --> 02:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire that I'm wondering if
 
02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
you could Enlighten us further with the
 
02:00:31.850 --> 02:00:31.860 align:start position:0%
status of what's going on with similar
 
02:00:34.129 --> 02:00:34.139 align:start position:0%
legislation to the informed legislation
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
at the at the federal level with with
 
02:00:39.410 --> 02:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
Congress and second uh part of my
 
02:00:41.330 --> 02:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
question is I see at the bottom of the
 
02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
page of the handout each page that this
 
02:00:46.910 --> 02:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
is uh Facebook Marketplace would it be
 
02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
accurate to say that the laws the
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
informed laws are so similar in the
 
02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
states that have enacted
 
02:00:56.510 --> 02:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
the informed legislation that Facebook
 
02:00:56.520 --> 02:00:58.010 align:start position:0%
the informed legislation that Facebook
Marketplace

02:00:58.010 --> 02:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
Marketplace
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
could not legally be doing this sort of
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
thing in those States right now and that
 
02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
02:01:07.609 --> 02:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
so two questions sure so to answer your
 
02:01:09.350 --> 02:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
first question first regarding you know
 
02:01:11.810 --> 02:01:11.820 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce I think part of the
 
02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is to help
 
02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
build a case
 
02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
in that situation so if you're a loss
 
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
prevention investigator or law
 
02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
enforcement and you can track down these
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
sellers maybe it's easier to build the
 
02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
case that you're involved with
 
02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:27.719 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce so it's giving a
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
state whether it's local law enforcement
 
02:01:32.629 --> 02:01:32.639 align:start position:0%
state law enforcement better tools to be
 
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
able to properly prosecute these folks
 
02:01:38.149 --> 02:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's helpful and um to
 
02:01:39.709 --> 02:01:39.719 align:start position:0%
your second question what we're seeing
 
02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
at the federal level like a lot of
 
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
things it's slow moving which is why
 
02:01:45.910 --> 02:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
you're seeing States take action both
 
02:01:48.890 --> 02:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
you know states of different political
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
backgrounds across the country are
 
02:01:52.609 --> 02:01:52.619 align:start position:0%
taking this up I know Maine is going to
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
be taking up this legislation next year
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
as well so the more states that pass it
 
02:01:58.070 --> 02:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to see better
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
compliance down the road but you know
 
02:02:02.810 --> 02:02:02.820 align:start position:0%
retailers are asking for some help
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
and into the second part of my question
 
02:02:10.310 --> 02:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
under the can Facebook Marketplace
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
in California Colorado say Arkansas
 
02:02:19.729 --> 02:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
because it's been how long has it been
 
02:02:22.490 --> 02:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
in law in Arkansas more than a year okay
 
02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
so so what's happening in Arkansas
 
02:02:27.890 --> 02:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
Facebook Marketplace do this in Arkansas
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
I would hope not but I don't know for
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
sure you don't know all right and I know
 
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
also some of the laws that have been
 
02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
passed don't take effect until 2023 as
 
02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:38.450 align:start position:0%
passed don't take effect until 2023 as
well

02:02:38.450 --> 02:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:40.189 --> 02:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
did I see a hand up over here
 
02:02:48.410 --> 02:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:50.089 --> 02:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
a year ago
 
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
um the eight the deputy one of the
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
assistant attorney generals came to
 
02:02:57.850 --> 02:02:57.860 align:start position:0%
testify and he was opposed to the
 
02:02:59.930 --> 02:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
legislation mostly because he did not
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
feel they had the resources or be would
 
02:03:05.689 --> 02:03:05.699 align:start position:0%
be given the resources in the department
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
um to be able to enforce what this bill
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
would require the other question I've
 
02:03:14.570 --> 02:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
got is Amazon is one of these big
 
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
marketplaces now online and
 
02:03:18.780 --> 02:03:19.669 align:start position:0%
marketplaces now online and
um

02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
they my understanding is that if you buy
 
02:03:25.850 --> 02:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
something fraudulently from an Amazon
 
02:03:28.910 --> 02:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
provider that Amazon will stand behind
 
02:03:32.270 --> 02:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
it is that correct so I can't speak for
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
Amazon uh specifically I know that
 
02:03:36.649 --> 02:03:36.659 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different marketplaces
 
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
out there and some are doing a better
 
02:03:40.910 --> 02:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
job than others about policing this this
 
02:03:42.890 --> 02:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
will help us regulate all the
 
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
marketplaces to be on a Level Playing
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
Field I will also add that I recently
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
met with attorney general formella to
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
talk about this bill he understands the
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
need for it I won't speak for him but if
 
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:56.580 align:start position:0%
we did have a conversation with him a
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
couple weeks ago and what was the result
 
02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
of the com of the conversation I would
 
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
say he understands that what we're
 
02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
talking about is to make sure that these
 
02:04:06.169 --> 02:04:06.179 align:start position:0%
sellers are providing similar
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
information to what a brick and mortar
 
02:04:09.649 --> 02:04:09.659 align:start position:0%
retailer is already providing so the
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
idea that it's actually going to need to
 
02:04:13.490 --> 02:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
get to the enforcement stage is probably
 
02:04:16.010 --> 02:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
a stretch but it's a tool there that's
 
02:04:18.410 --> 02:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
available if needed so that would be
 
02:04:20.209 --> 02:04:20.219 align:start position:0%
that his Department
 
02:04:22.729 --> 02:04:22.739 align:start position:0%
the spokesperson for from his Department
 
02:04:25.310 --> 02:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
would have changed his testimony if in
 
02:04:27.410 --> 02:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
fact the Attorney General had been in on
 
02:04:29.390 --> 02:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
that at that time yeah and I wasn't here
 
02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
last year but like I said we met with
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
the attorney general a couple weeks ago
 
02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
okay thanks but if I if I can add two I
 
02:04:37.450 --> 02:04:37.460 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
02:04:39.890 --> 02:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
I remember the Attorney General's office
 
02:04:42.890 --> 02:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
testifying I don't recall that they took
 
02:04:45.530 --> 02:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
a position of opposition I I do think
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
some of their testimony was a little bit
 
02:04:51.290 --> 02:04:51.300 align:start position:0%
confusing over on on the committee
 
02:04:53.629 --> 02:04:53.639 align:start position:0%
um but I I don't think they actually
 
02:04:57.530 --> 02:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
took a a firm position either way and I
 
02:04:58.970 --> 02:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
don't think there was a position of
 
02:05:01.129 --> 02:05:01.139 align:start position:0%
opposition but yeah I mean I guess we
 
02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
could check the file to see what came in
 
02:05:07.850 --> 02:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:12.649 --> 02:05:12.659 align:start position:0%
okay so who's next uh Anita for us
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
thanks um
 
02:05:18.470 --> 02:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
well as written now is ready to go
 
02:05:21.050 --> 02:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
and and would you support it
 
02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
we would absolutely support it yeah this
 
02:05:25.550 --> 02:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
is this is this version is the the model
 
02:05:27.169 --> 02:05:27.179 align:start position:0%
that is cropped up most frequently
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
across the country now okay thank you if
 
02:05:31.550 --> 02:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
I can also add to that in the Senate
 
02:05:34.010 --> 02:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
there was significant work done on this
 
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
bill so it isn't the version as
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
introduced stakeholders I think all
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
walked away feeling that this was a
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
workable piece of legislation when it
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
passed and that's why all 24 Senators
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
voted for it
 
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
so I guess the first comment I have is
 
02:05:52.609 --> 02:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
um all these examples you've given here
 
02:05:54.169 --> 02:05:54.179 align:start position:0%
does not mean that this law will
 
02:05:55.570 --> 02:05:55.580 align:start position:0%
actually affect these people at all
 
02:05:57.890 --> 02:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
because they're selling the product for
 
02:05:59.330 --> 02:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
a dollar
 
02:06:01.490 --> 02:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
and they have to sell five thousand
 
02:06:07.149 --> 02:06:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
200 discrete sales and I would be
 
02:06:10.850 --> 02:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
ventured to say that they probably
 
02:06:12.950 --> 02:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
haven't sold any because there's some
 
02:06:15.169 --> 02:06:15.179 align:start position:0%
scam that's going on and they don't
 
02:06:18.290 --> 02:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
actually make a sale uh Mr Mr chair if I
 
02:06:20.270 --> 02:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
could if you read the description below
 
02:06:22.850 --> 02:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
on the top page you'll see let me know
 
02:06:24.050 --> 02:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
if you see something you're interested
 
02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
in and I will give you a price yep yeah
 
02:06:28.370 --> 02:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
so the dollar is not the actual price
 
02:06:32.689 --> 02:06:32.699 align:start position:0%
it's to get interest so how does it
 
02:06:35.330 --> 02:06:35.340 align:start position:0%
again I I never even knew about Facebook
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
Marketplace until this bill came in okay
 
02:06:39.649 --> 02:06:39.659 align:start position:0%
because I I don't have anything to do
 
02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
with Facebook but and now I was
 
02:06:43.910 --> 02:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
surprised to learn about it okay because
 
02:06:46.490 --> 02:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
I always thought of Craigslist
 
02:06:48.410 --> 02:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
um what the problem being is is that
 
02:06:56.689 --> 02:06:56.699 align:start position:0%
then the transaction now is between the
 
02:06:59.450 --> 02:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
individual and this person who's selling
 
02:07:03.169 --> 02:07:03.179 align:start position:0%
and Facebook has absolutely no idea
 
02:07:06.229 --> 02:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
what the product was sold for
 
02:07:09.109 --> 02:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
so again how does
 
02:07:09.119 --> 02:07:09.850 align:start position:0%
so again how does
this

02:07:09.850 --> 02:07:09.860 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:07:13.850 --> 02:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
the this legislation will never never
 
02:07:16.490 --> 02:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
have any impact on Facebook because they
 
02:07:18.890 --> 02:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
would always say is we don't track that
 
02:07:20.930 --> 02:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
that's not our job we don't know
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
anything about that
 
02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
I think it's fairly easy to go on to
 
02:07:28.070 --> 02:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
these sites and find sellers that are
 
02:07:30.470 --> 02:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
have multiple items for sale on multiple
 
02:07:32.330 --> 02:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
pages and that's what we're talking
 
02:07:34.490 --> 02:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
about so we're not talking about an
 
02:07:36.410 --> 02:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
individual that's just selling one item
 
02:07:37.970 --> 02:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
you have you know something in your
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
closet you want to get rid of we're
 
02:07:42.290 --> 02:07:42.300 align:start position:0%
talking about individuals that are in
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
the business of reselling things online
 
02:07:47.089 --> 02:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
so they have some sort of significant
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
online presence and we're asking these
 
02:07:52.250 --> 02:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
marketplaces to just make sure you know
 
02:07:53.810 --> 02:07:53.820 align:start position:0%
who these people are what's their real
 
02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
name do they have a real physical
 
02:08:02.689 --> 02:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative aberson
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is what you're what
 
02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
you're asking us to do is to take online
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
retailers that are selling at this level
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
and you want them all you know brick and
 
02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
mortar stores and online retailers uh to
 
02:08:20.570 --> 02:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
be under the same basically the same set
 
02:08:23.089 --> 02:08:23.099 align:start position:0%
of roles where we we can track them find
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
out who they are
 
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
and my other question is somebody
 
02:08:29.209 --> 02:08:29.219 align:start position:0%
brought up interstate commerce as is in
 
02:08:31.490 --> 02:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
the U.S Constitution if someone is
 
02:08:33.950 --> 02:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
trafficking and stolen items is that
 
02:08:36.109 --> 02:08:36.119 align:start position:0%
considered Commerce that's that doesn't
 
02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
sound like something that would be
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
regulated we don't regulate illegal
 
02:08:41.149 --> 02:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
activity that
 
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
is that Commerce if you're trafficking
 
02:08:43.850 --> 02:08:43.860 align:start position:0%
and stolen because it sounds like
 
02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:45.229 align:start position:0%
and stolen because it sounds like
trafficking

02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
02:08:46.729 --> 02:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
it could be Interstate trafficking but
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
it would still be an illegal thing
 
02:08:50.330 --> 02:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
occurring in our state I think if you're
 
02:08:52.729 --> 02:08:52.739 align:start position:0%
shipping something across state line so
 
02:08:53.930 --> 02:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're buying something
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's being shipped to you that's where
 
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
the interstate commerce would come into
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
play okay
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
um so I do want to give a disclaimer I
 
02:09:03.530 --> 02:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
work in retail tech support right now
 
02:09:05.570 --> 02:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
even though I work behind the tech bench
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
we see people shoplifting all the time I
 
02:09:11.089 --> 02:09:11.099 align:start position:0%
can see them going out and sometimes the
 
02:09:12.649 --> 02:09:12.659 align:start position:0%
cars license plates in Connecticut
 
02:09:13.970 --> 02:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's in New Hampshire
 
02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's in Massachusetts and this
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
is becoming the shoplifting issue and
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
then obviously selling it online is
 
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
becoming a pandemic and it is
 
02:09:26.089 --> 02:09:26.099 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing the whole the whole retail
 
02:09:27.169 --> 02:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
um all of our brick and mortar stores
 
02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
about 45 of our retail store sales come
 
02:09:31.850 --> 02:09:31.860 align:start position:0%
from out of state and we have one of the
 
02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:32.870 align:start position:0%
from out of state and we have one of the
largest

02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
largest
 
02:09:36.350 --> 02:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh retail Industries in New England per
 
02:09:37.970 --> 02:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
capita probably the largest because of
 
02:09:40.850 --> 02:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
Arnold sales tax and uh there are a lot
 
02:09:43.310 --> 02:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of jobs and there are lots
 
02:09:45.649 --> 02:09:45.659 align:start position:0%
of businesses and and you know Trucking
 
02:09:47.330 --> 02:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
and advertising distribution businesses
 
02:09:50.149 --> 02:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
that depend on on retail this is getting
 
02:09:53.109 --> 02:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
to the point where the amount of of
 
02:09:55.550 --> 02:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
shoplifting that's going on and then we
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
know what happens to them later on once
 
02:09:58.850 --> 02:09:58.860 align:start position:0%
they track are able to track some of
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
these cases down as they usually get
 
02:10:02.750 --> 02:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
sold online or they may even get shipped
 
02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
sold online or they may even get shipped
overseas

02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:03.730 align:start position:0%
overseas
 
02:10:03.730 --> 02:10:04.310 align:start position:0%
overseas
[Music]

02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:04.910 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:07.970 --> 02:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
but it's the the costs are on the order
 
02:10:10.129 --> 02:10:10.139 align:start position:0%
of like two full-time employees and the
 
02:10:11.689 --> 02:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
amount is going up and up and up every
 
02:10:13.129 --> 02:10:13.139 align:start position:0%
year and it's becoming a dramatic
 
02:10:14.570 --> 02:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
problem that could potentially shut down
 
02:10:17.209 --> 02:10:17.219 align:start position:0%
some of our our retail stores
 
02:10:21.290 --> 02:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh represent Grayson did you have a okay
 
02:10:23.330 --> 02:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
representative ham did you have thank
 
02:10:23.340 --> 02:10:24.950 align:start position:0%
representative ham did you have thank
you

02:10:24.950 --> 02:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:10:26.930 --> 02:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering
 
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
um what is the
 
02:10:28.679 --> 02:10:30.010 align:start position:0%
um what is the
information

02:10:30.010 --> 02:10:30.020 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:10:33.530 --> 02:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
that you would need these types of
 
02:10:37.010 --> 02:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
sellers to provide I mean register with
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
a Better Business Bureau uh I don't know
 
02:10:42.830 --> 02:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
what what would give consumer protection
 
02:10:45.229 --> 02:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
you know the person buying some sort of
 
02:10:45.239 --> 02:10:46.490 align:start position:0%
you know the person buying some sort of
protection

02:10:46.490 --> 02:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
protection
 
02:10:48.410 --> 02:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
they are competing with the brick and
 
02:10:50.689 --> 02:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
mortars and and what is necessary for
 
02:10:51.770 --> 02:10:51.780 align:start position:0%
them to be
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
a reputable
 
02:10:57.050 --> 02:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
venue under which to buy your products
 
02:10:59.510 --> 02:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
yep uh the the bill details that it
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
would require the full name of the
 
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
seller uh or the company sellers company
 
02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
name the physical address of the seller
 
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
the contact information for the seller
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
to allow for Direct on entered
 
02:11:11.149 --> 02:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
communication a current working phone
 
02:11:12.649 --> 02:11:12.659 align:start position:0%
number and a current working email
 
02:11:12.659 --> 02:11:14.990 align:start position:0%
number and a current working email
address

02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:11:16.970 --> 02:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
and if they're fraudulent then they have
 
02:11:19.729 --> 02:11:19.739 align:start position:0%
to call the Attorney General's office is
 
02:11:20.990 --> 02:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
that the way this bill is supposed to be
 
02:11:23.689 --> 02:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
written no no if the marketplace is not
 
02:11:26.149 --> 02:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
requiring their sellers right what I'm
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
saying is you you contacted the
 
02:11:28.199 --> 02:11:29.450 align:start position:0%
saying is you you contacted the
marketplace

02:11:29.450 --> 02:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
and the marketplace supposedly have
 
02:11:32.990 --> 02:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
gotten this information
 
02:11:35.930 --> 02:11:35.940 align:start position:0%
and you haven't and that that what what
 
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
they give you is fraudulent is wrong
 
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
then what's the next step what what's
 
02:11:43.850 --> 02:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
the what what have you done so what
 
02:11:45.229 --> 02:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen in this situation
 
02:11:47.689 --> 02:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
let's take the Ryobi tools which is a
 
02:11:49.729 --> 02:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
Home Depot product so Home Depot
 
02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
investigators are going on these
 
02:11:53.810 --> 02:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
different marketplaces tracking their
 
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
items they're building a case and then
 
02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
they're going to go to these
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
marketplaces and say look we we've been
 
02:12:02.629 --> 02:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
able to track these sellers right we
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
have questions about why they're selling
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
Ryobi tools right
 
02:12:09.290 --> 02:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
what information do you have on them
 
02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
okay in form act are you collecting
 
02:12:14.270 --> 02:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
their names their address okay and then
 
02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
so so who's going to make them take it
 
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
off their platform
 
02:12:25.250 --> 02:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
the platform itself so you're assuming
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
that the Facebook that that if you
 
02:12:31.250 --> 02:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:33.649 --> 02:12:33.659 align:start position:0%
and they'll take this off they'll take
 
02:12:35.810 --> 02:12:35.820 align:start position:0%
it down it will never go on in the first
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
place right if you can't verify who your
 
02:12:41.629 --> 02:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
vendor is you're not allowed to put them
 
02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
on your platform correct so you nip it
 
02:12:45.550 --> 02:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
okay no no no no
 
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
they got fraudulent information
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
the person who put it on is not telling
 
02:12:52.970 --> 02:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
him anything that's truthful
 
02:12:55.250 --> 02:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
all that phone number address and all
 
02:12:57.530 --> 02:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
that is all fraudulent
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
and you call them up and say Facebook
 
02:13:02.930 --> 02:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
you know would it
 
02:13:06.290 --> 02:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
I I'm a little skeptical of this tell me
 
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
which information you got
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
and Facebook gives you all this
 
02:13:12.649 --> 02:13:12.659 align:start position:0%
fraudulent information that they thought
 
02:13:13.850 --> 02:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
they had
 
02:13:15.410 --> 02:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
that they thought they were in
 
02:13:18.290 --> 02:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
compliance and you got this then what
 
02:13:20.810 --> 02:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
what's the next step you called Facebook
 
02:13:22.850 --> 02:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
and said by the way everything you just
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
said or did is fraudulent
 
02:13:29.089 --> 02:13:29.099 align:start position:0%
then then what so I actually think and I
 
02:13:30.410 --> 02:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
don't have the bill I'm sorry in front
 
02:13:32.149 --> 02:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
of me but I think there's more that
 
02:13:34.010 --> 02:13:34.020 align:start position:0%
needs to be verified than the four items
 
02:13:36.169 --> 02:13:36.179 align:start position:0%
that was just there's a bunch of items
 
02:13:37.850 --> 02:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
so again there's a bunch of items but
 
02:13:40.370 --> 02:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
tax ID number needs to be and that's all
 
02:13:42.410 --> 02:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
is fraudulent so in other words you're
 
02:13:46.129 --> 02:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
you're expecting that Facebook went that
 
02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:52.129 --> 02:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
or let's take another big States
 
02:13:54.669 --> 02:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania and Ohio
 
02:13:59.390 --> 02:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
that Facebook will have have made sure
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
this never got listed on their Facebook
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's I mean how why haven't they taken
 
02:14:06.649 --> 02:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
them down why if the laws are already in
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
place why is this existing
 
02:14:12.169 --> 02:14:12.179 align:start position:0%
so I think it is likely that that
 
02:14:14.569 --> 02:14:14.579 align:start position:0%
example though that person is
 
02:14:17.450 --> 02:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
negotiating the price directly that's
 
02:14:21.169 --> 02:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
not the role that Amazon or
 
02:14:25.069 --> 02:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
a third-party Marketplace uh does so if
 
02:14:27.470 --> 02:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
this is like Craigslist we're they're
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
selling one item right they're not going
 
02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
to go through this process this is
 
02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:37.250 align:start position:0%
to go through this process this is
foreign

02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:40.010 --> 02:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
platform as an intermediary to sell
 
02:14:41.870 --> 02:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
their product and actually do the
 
02:14:44.589 --> 02:14:44.599 align:start position:0%
transaction so it really winnows it down
 
02:14:48.770 --> 02:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
uh even further so in my past life and I
 
02:14:50.209 --> 02:14:50.219 align:start position:0%
think I told this you this to you guys
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
before and this is the reason why I have
 
02:14:54.169 --> 02:14:54.179 align:start position:0%
a problem with this legislation
 
02:14:57.290 --> 02:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
and that is that I want our consumer
 
02:14:59.689 --> 02:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
protection division to be focusing on
 
02:15:02.330 --> 02:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
making consumers whole in New Hampshire
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
so I've always was offended about having
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
this stuck in the consumer protection
 
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
act first of all but second of all in my
 
02:15:14.689 --> 02:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
past life I was an apple IBM retailer
 
02:15:18.649 --> 02:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
and the problem of gray marketing
 
02:15:20.209 --> 02:15:20.219 align:start position:0%
that's what it was called
 
02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
the problem with great marketing because
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
they're always accusing us retailers of
 
02:15:27.410 --> 02:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
being the great marketer
 
02:15:30.109 --> 02:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
okay was which it could be these could
 
02:15:32.209 --> 02:15:32.219 align:start position:0%
be retailers or great marketing or
 
02:15:34.430 --> 02:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
selling these things are using this as a
 
02:15:36.709 --> 02:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
strategy to sell okay but more
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
importantly was that those manufacturers
 
02:15:43.850 --> 02:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
and and I hope after this you will call
 
02:15:46.750 --> 02:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
you will have one of your you must have
 
02:15:49.430 --> 02:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
one of your clients one of the your you
 
02:15:52.850 --> 02:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
know your members is our sells this
 
02:15:55.729 --> 02:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
product they have called Roby and said
 
02:15:57.410 --> 02:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
have you guys ordered some of these
 
02:16:01.609 --> 02:16:01.619 align:start position:0%
things and see and and see who is
 
02:16:04.609 --> 02:16:04.619 align:start position:0%
selling it getting it from them my
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
experience was when it came to gray
 
02:16:08.810 --> 02:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
marketing the companies found out about
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
it because inside every one of these
 
02:16:14.810 --> 02:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
boxes was a warranty card
 
02:16:17.149 --> 02:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
and the consumer filled out the warranty
 
02:16:17.159 --> 02:16:17.930 align:start position:0%
and the consumer filled out the warranty
card

02:16:17.930 --> 02:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
card
 
02:16:21.709 --> 02:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
and mailed it in and that manufacturer
 
02:16:25.010 --> 02:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
would say is this guy's not one of our
 
02:16:28.729 --> 02:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
licensed retailers
 
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
and then they went after them
 
02:16:34.370 --> 02:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
and they tracked him down
 
02:16:37.730 --> 02:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
so the ask Attorney General's office or
 
02:16:40.730 --> 02:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
I'd expect that passing a statue in
 
02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
little Podunk New Hampshire
 
02:16:45.530 --> 02:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
when I bet you and I love to hear what's
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
happened in Arkansas that's I'd love to
 
02:16:48.950 --> 02:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
hear what's happened in these other
 
02:16:50.810 --> 02:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
states have passed this law
 
02:16:53.570 --> 02:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
convince me that this law does anything
 
02:16:55.429 --> 02:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
other than feel good that we pass
 
02:16:55.439 --> 02:16:57.469 align:start position:0%
other than feel good that we pass
something

02:16:57.469 --> 02:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:16:57.479 --> 02:17:00.290 align:start position:0%
something
please

02:17:00.290 --> 02:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:01.849 --> 02:17:01.859 align:start position:0%
represent Grayson
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:10.009 --> 02:17:10.019 align:start position:0%
the in our all of our discussions we
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
focused a lot of time on Amazon and
 
02:17:15.370 --> 02:17:15.380 align:start position:0%
Walmart as being these large
 
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
marketplaces where third-party vendors
 
02:17:20.690 --> 02:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
and they both your microphone is too far
 
02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:21.790 align:start position:0%
and they both your microphone is too far
away

02:17:21.790 --> 02:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:17:24.530 --> 02:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
all right I will be more of a loudmouth
 
02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:25.629 align:start position:0%
all right I will be more of a loudmouth
then

02:17:25.629 --> 02:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:17:29.209 --> 02:17:29.219 align:start position:0%
those those marketplaces already collect
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
that data if you go in and look at their
 
02:17:33.049 --> 02:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
requirements to be a seller on Amazon or
 
02:17:35.209 --> 02:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
a seller on Walmart they collect all
 
02:17:37.610 --> 02:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
that information already but one of the
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
things that is not dealt with in this
 
02:17:41.209 --> 02:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
legislation and when you provide this
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
example on Facebook Marketplace not
 
02:17:44.570 --> 02:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
everybody who is selling on Facebook
 
02:17:47.690 --> 02:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
Marketplace is a business with a tax ID
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
number so you either have to require
 
02:17:51.770 --> 02:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
every individual who's selling his car
 
02:17:54.589 --> 02:17:54.599 align:start position:0%
or snow plow to get a tax ID number in
 
02:17:55.610 --> 02:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
order to be able to make that
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
transaction or you can't regulate it at
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
all because Facebook Marketplace
 
02:18:04.190 --> 02:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
is where individuals although businesses
 
02:18:06.530 --> 02:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
do have Facebook Marketplace presences
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
but an individual person can get on
 
02:18:12.110 --> 02:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
there and sell their individual property
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh on those markets so Craigslist falls
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
under that as well eBay is a little bit
 
02:18:19.250 --> 02:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
different as they do require uh
 
02:18:21.410 --> 02:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
different information and collect that
 
02:18:23.690 --> 02:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
information uh and they do actually get
 
02:18:25.790 --> 02:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
a fee for what you sell but Facebook
 
02:18:27.469 --> 02:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
Marketplace is free and open Craigslist
 
02:18:29.389 --> 02:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
is free there's they don't regulate any
 
02:18:31.129 --> 02:18:31.139 align:start position:0%
of the con The Exchange that takes place
 
02:18:34.310 --> 02:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
they're just listings of those but also
 
02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
and on top of that this legislation does
 
02:18:38.450 --> 02:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
not at all deal with the bill of lading
 
02:18:40.730 --> 02:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
that says this guy has the owns this
 
02:18:42.410 --> 02:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
property and has the right to sell it
 
02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
and so if you're not you're not you're
 
02:18:46.250 --> 02:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
just verifying name and address but
 
02:18:48.250 --> 02:18:48.260 align:start position:0%
you're not verifying this could just be
 
02:18:51.349 --> 02:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh whatever Mike in Manchester or
 
02:18:53.450 --> 02:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
whatever his name is selling whatever it
 
02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
is that he got uh maybe he owns them and
 
02:18:58.310 --> 02:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
he has the right to sell them who knows
 
02:19:00.230 --> 02:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
you're not providing any requirement
 
02:19:03.230 --> 02:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
that he shows proof of ownership and the
 
02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
right therefore to sell it and so we
 
02:19:08.509 --> 02:19:08.519 align:start position:0%
aside from the enforcement that
 
02:19:10.849 --> 02:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
representative hunt was bringing out uh
 
02:19:14.330 --> 02:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
the the the legislation is really not
 
02:19:16.370 --> 02:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
going to in in its current form is not
 
02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
going to work uh because it oh it's it's
 
02:19:22.450 --> 02:19:22.460 align:start position:0%
requiring information from
 
02:19:24.770 --> 02:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
non-business entities
 
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
and because these individual person is
 
02:19:29.330 --> 02:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
not a business
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
so representative if I could um the bill
 
02:19:34.429 --> 02:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
does specify this only applies to high
 
02:19:36.589 --> 02:19:36.599 align:start position:0%
volume sellers so you have to do at
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
least 200 transactions a year and 5 000
 
02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
in sales so an individual just selling
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
items it would not apply to them right
 
02:19:46.969 --> 02:19:46.979 align:start position:0%
and this guy just has 20 or so ryobi's
 
02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
he's never going to get busted this is a
 
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
sting operation you just call them up
 
02:19:52.550 --> 02:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
say yeah I want to buy one and then you
 
02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
go bust him
 
02:19:56.330 --> 02:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
that's what this is and that's the only
 
02:19:58.250 --> 02:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
way you're ever going to nip this
 
02:19:59.990 --> 02:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're asking for another
 
02:20:03.849 --> 02:20:03.859 align:start position:0%
tool in the belt I mean both retail
 
02:20:06.050 --> 02:20:06.060 align:start position:0%
retail loss prevention and law
 
02:20:07.969 --> 02:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
enforcement have a very good working
 
02:20:10.310 --> 02:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
relationship and but selling stolen
 
02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
goods is already illegal you can already
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
go after them for that
 
02:20:14.399 --> 02:20:16.730 align:start position:0%
go after them for that
like

02:20:16.730 --> 02:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:20:18.889 --> 02:20:18.899 align:start position:0%
uh let's have someone who hasn't uh yeah
 
02:20:21.530 --> 02:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert
 
02:20:24.050 --> 02:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
you put your mic on
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
so they have a they have a real issue
 
02:20:28.370 --> 02:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
with crime and fraud
 
02:20:30.050 --> 02:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to get some
 
02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
information or put something I can't
 
02:20:33.230 --> 02:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying from here can
 
02:20:39.050 --> 02:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:40.370 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:20:40.370 --> 02:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
we're having a real they're having a
 
02:20:45.410 --> 02:20:45.420 align:start position:0%
real problem with crime and fraud and
 
02:20:47.330 --> 02:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
they're trying to get some impediments
 
02:20:49.309 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
in the way that might be able to
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
identify who's doing the crime and the
 
02:20:54.050 --> 02:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
fraud which to me is common sense
 
02:20:56.090 --> 02:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
I also thought about the ideas you just
 
02:20:58.610 --> 02:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
put it up like this and then you get
 
02:21:01.130 --> 02:21:01.140 align:start position:0%
five orders and then you go steal it
 
02:21:03.710 --> 02:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
from the the vendor you've got to get
 
02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
the orders first first you get the
 
02:21:07.010 --> 02:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
orders then you go steal it and and we
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
had somebody remark that you just
 
02:21:11.270 --> 02:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
watches that walk out of the store so
 
02:21:13.849 --> 02:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
it's it's a serious problem the ID
 
02:21:16.969 --> 02:21:16.979 align:start position:0%
number your social security number
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
all those things can be verified pretty
 
02:21:22.910 --> 02:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
quickly so in other words if somebody
 
02:21:26.929 --> 02:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
gives you comes in and to us one of the
 
02:21:31.550 --> 02:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
platforms and and you ask them for four
 
02:21:35.090 --> 02:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
things I guess I I don't I don't find
 
02:21:36.889 --> 02:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
that actually believable I would think
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
before you could get on a platform you
 
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
would need a lot of information that's
 
02:21:46.250 --> 02:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
verifiable but I don't see why uh we
 
02:21:46.260 --> 02:21:48.530 align:start position:0%
verifiable but I don't see why uh we
would

02:21:48.530 --> 02:21:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:53.210 --> 02:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
be opposed to somebody coming in and
 
02:21:55.969 --> 02:21:55.979 align:start position:0%
saying look we have a problem and and
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to say well you could do
 
02:21:59.809 --> 02:21:59.819 align:start position:0%
this and you could do that and you could
 
02:22:02.570 --> 02:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
do this that's their problem okay but
 
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
they had they need some support
 
02:22:08.450 --> 02:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
they need some practical support they
 
02:22:10.910 --> 02:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
need some political support so that they
 
02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
know what they that we say okay you can
 
02:22:17.090 --> 02:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
go after them all right they can may
 
02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
come back and say oh we found this out
 
02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
and it makes it easier to identify
 
02:22:25.490 --> 02:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
quickly identify somebody when they're
 
02:22:27.110 --> 02:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
being fraudulent
 
02:22:29.570 --> 02:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
so I tell you what I think that's a
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
great idea and what I would hope that
 
02:22:33.650 --> 02:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
when Senator Brazil puts his bill in
 
02:22:36.290 --> 02:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
again next year that you guys will be
 
02:22:37.730 --> 02:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
able to come back and tell us what's
 
02:22:40.429 --> 02:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
happened in Arkansas and other states on
 
02:22:42.590 --> 02:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
how they pursued this and how they were
 
02:22:45.290 --> 02:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
able to find some bad apples out to
 
02:22:46.610 --> 02:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
people who are out there who are doing
 
02:22:49.550 --> 02:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
this and but I would beg you Senator
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
Bridge I'll do not put it under the
 
02:22:52.969 --> 02:22:52.979 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act
 
02:22:56.450 --> 02:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
it's put it put it in Criminal
 
02:22:58.910 --> 02:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
activities you know that's selling
 
02:23:01.490 --> 02:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
fraudulent materials but because this is
 
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
a federal this is a this is a cross
 
02:23:05.630 --> 02:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
Interstate issue it's not consumer
 
02:23:06.889 --> 02:23:06.899 align:start position:0%
protection New Hampshire consumer
 
02:23:09.469 --> 02:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
protection problem
 
02:23:12.050 --> 02:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
02:23:13.250 --> 02:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know where my follow-up I was
 
02:23:14.030 --> 02:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
just going to say what they're
 
02:23:16.130 --> 02:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
introducing these for is just examples
 
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
there are thousands and thousands of
 
02:23:20.389 --> 02:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
other examples the most of the
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
shoplifters who are coming into retail I
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
I understand there are some people who
 
02:23:27.170 --> 02:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
are desperate for food feed their family
 
02:23:30.530 --> 02:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
they they do steal from uh grocery
 
02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
stores from time to time but most of the
 
02:23:34.070 --> 02:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
things that they're taking from retail
 
02:23:36.170 --> 02:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
are things that they don't need to eat
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
or or drink and and they're they're very
 
02:23:40.790 --> 02:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
well organized we'll see them one person
 
02:23:43.309 --> 02:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
drives a very expensive car and then one
 
02:23:45.230 --> 02:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
two or three people sometimes they're
 
02:23:48.170 --> 02:23:48.180 align:start position:0%
obviously drug addicts or something just
 
02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
people they just picked up homeless
 
02:23:51.050 --> 02:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
people they may have picked up and they
 
02:23:52.490 --> 02:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
send them in to get very specific
 
02:23:55.010 --> 02:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
products and they'll walk out on a
 
02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
summer day with a big oversized jacket
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
with multiple things and as soon as the
 
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
guy kind of gets into the car they pull
 
02:24:02.090 --> 02:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
all these different things out and they
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
keep them out of sight and we've got
 
02:24:04.969 --> 02:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
some of them I've actually got photos
 
02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
and and video of some of these people
 
02:24:10.849 --> 02:24:10.859 align:start position:0%
doing it so uh there has to be there has
 
02:24:13.670 --> 02:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
to be a way to track them number one I
 
02:24:14.990 --> 02:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
don't think that they need to store
 
02:24:17.090 --> 02:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
Social Security numbers and whatnot
 
02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
maybe we can tokenize those people's
 
02:24:21.429 --> 02:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
Social Security numbers or hash them or
 
02:24:24.590 --> 02:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh that way so there's no way to trace
 
02:24:26.690 --> 02:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
their number back okay so we're we're
 
02:24:29.809 --> 02:24:29.819 align:start position:0%
getting near the end here and thank you
 
02:24:32.450 --> 02:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
very much this is a crisis facing the
 
02:24:35.389 --> 02:24:35.399 align:start position:0%
state right now okay representative if I
 
02:24:37.130 --> 02:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
could just make a request gentlemen and
 
02:24:40.130 --> 02:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
my esteemed a senate colleague when this
 
02:24:43.070 --> 02:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
comes back to us next year it would be
 
02:24:45.849 --> 02:24:45.859 align:start position:0%
really helpful if when you provide
 
02:24:49.070 --> 02:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
exhibits illustrative material that we
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
actually have identified parties that
 
02:24:53.450 --> 02:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
would be covered by the bill because I
 
02:24:54.590 --> 02:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
think one of the things I've learned
 
02:24:58.250 --> 02:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
here today is that this is not a high
 
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
volume seller illustration so it'd be
 
02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
helpful if if you're going to draw the
 
02:25:06.650 --> 02:25:06.660 align:start position:0%
line at a certain dollar figure in a
 
02:25:09.770 --> 02:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
certain whatever that we see examples of
 
02:25:14.270 --> 02:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
parties who are we would be covered by
 
02:25:16.309 --> 02:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
the legislation that you're proposing
 
02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:20.330 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:25:20.330 --> 02:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:25:23.870 --> 02:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
could I make a recommendation yes I
 
02:25:26.990 --> 02:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
would recommend that it um we recommend
 
02:25:29.690 --> 02:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
it for future legislation
 
02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:36.530 --> 02:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
all right I think we've had enough of
 
02:25:40.190 --> 02:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
this and thank you all very much
 
02:25:42.889 --> 02:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
all right we'll now recess for lunch
 
02:25:46.790 --> 02:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
and and I see that uh one representative
 
02:25:48.770 --> 02:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
for the Liquor Commission here
 
02:25:48.780 --> 02:25:51.170 align:start position:0%
for the Liquor Commission here
um so

02:25:51.170 --> 02:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:25:53.690 --> 02:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
we actually knows digital assets didn't
 
02:25:56.030 --> 02:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
we're all set with that right you know
 
02:25:57.610 --> 02:25:57.620 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
02:26:01.790 --> 02:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
and then so we'll be like or so yeah so
 
02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:03.230 align:start position:0%
and then so we'll be like or so yeah so
um

02:26:03.230 --> 02:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:03.240 --> 02:26:05.330 align:start position:0%
um
we

02:26:05.330 --> 02:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:26:08.450 --> 02:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
will probably be back by 1 30.
 
02:26:08.460 --> 02:26:10.610 align:start position:0%
will probably be back by 1 30.
okay

02:26:10.610 --> 02:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:40.910 --> 02:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:28.370 --> 03:33:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:28.380 --> 03:33:31.610 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:33:31.610 --> 03:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:33.889 --> 03:33:33.899 align:start position:0%
so we'll open up uh
 
03:33:33.899 --> 03:33:36.349 align:start position:0%
so we'll open up uh
1502

03:33:36.349 --> 03:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
1502
 
03:33:36.359 --> 03:33:38.929 align:start position:0%
1502
and

03:33:38.929 --> 03:33:38.939 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:44.150 --> 03:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:45.889 --> 03:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair uh if you
 
03:33:47.269 --> 03:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
remember 1502 was one of the
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency bills like uh 1502
 
03:33:53.090 --> 03:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
actually got folded into 1503.
 
03:33:56.450 --> 03:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
uh somewhat for procedural issues and it
 
03:33:58.610 --> 03:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
adopted the Uniform Commercial Code
 
03:34:01.070 --> 03:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
article 12.
 
03:34:03.469 --> 03:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
um that article has been updated so
 
03:34:06.229 --> 03:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
there's a red line copy reinhale from
 
03:34:08.510 --> 03:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
the bankers Association has provided me
 
03:34:10.969 --> 03:34:10.979 align:start position:0%
with the redline copy of some minor
 
03:34:12.650 --> 03:34:12.660 align:start position:0%
final changes so I'll be submitting
 
03:34:16.849 --> 03:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
legislation just to polish that off uh
 
03:34:19.190 --> 03:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
the bankers Association had a
 
03:34:21.229 --> 03:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency conference a few weeks
 
03:34:21.239 --> 03:34:22.070 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency conference a few weeks
ago

03:34:22.070 --> 03:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:34:24.729 --> 03:34:24.739 align:start position:0%
and a fellow by the name of Ed Ed Smith
 
03:34:27.349 --> 03:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
was there as a presenter
 
03:34:29.990 --> 03:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
and he presented all about the Uniform
 
03:34:33.229 --> 03:34:33.239 align:start position:0%
Commercial Code article 12. and he was
 
03:34:34.729 --> 03:34:34.739 align:start position:0%
very excited that New Hampshire was the
 
03:34:37.070 --> 03:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
first state to adopt the most recent
 
03:34:39.650 --> 03:34:39.660 align:start position:0%
draft and he said that the the changes
 
03:34:43.010 --> 03:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
will be minor you know shot and Tittle
 
03:34:44.450 --> 03:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
type changes
 
03:34:46.969 --> 03:34:46.979 align:start position:0%
uh so that's that's what I have in mind
 
03:34:49.070 --> 03:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
I did want to say thank you to the chair
 
03:34:51.290 --> 03:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
and to leader Osborne when I was in my
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
accident I had an accident I was in the
 
03:34:56.990 --> 03:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
hospital and uh you both uh helped this
 
03:34:59.929 --> 03:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
bill get across the Finish Line uh in
 
03:35:01.790 --> 03:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference
 
03:35:04.010 --> 03:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately uh Tom Sherman
 
03:35:05.929 --> 03:35:05.939 align:start position:0%
Amendment got added to the bill but
 
03:35:08.210 --> 03:35:08.220 align:start position:0%
that's okay I forgive you
 
03:35:12.070 --> 03:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
the steel the steel the steel nonsense
 
03:35:15.349 --> 03:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
but I appreciate you guys uh helping me
 
03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
when I was not able to
 
03:35:25.849 --> 03:35:25.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:28.370 --> 03:35:28.380 align:start position:0%
I heard that was going around it was I
 
03:35:30.170 --> 03:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
don't know I one of the things that I
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
asked about was how is that bill doing
 
03:35:33.290 --> 03:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
he was really pissed off when he came
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
came to and he heard that that everybody
 
03:35:37.969 --> 03:35:37.979 align:start position:0%
had to give me a conference walked out
 
03:35:43.130 --> 03:35:43.140 align:start position:0%
of the room with nothing and uh so so we
 
03:35:45.469 --> 03:35:45.479 align:start position:0%
did compel us to uh
 
03:35:48.830 --> 03:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh use that as an argument to come up
 
03:35:52.190 --> 03:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
with the compromise on Steel
 
03:35:55.809 --> 03:35:55.819 align:start position:0%
um so so I guess I'm not quite clear
 
03:35:59.990 --> 03:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
1502 we put into interim study but does
 
03:36:02.330 --> 03:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
that it was just as a backup because we
 
03:36:03.950 --> 03:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't need it we don't need it period we
 
03:36:06.290 --> 03:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
don't know 1502 got the the substance if
 
03:36:08.750 --> 03:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's there to modified for the UCC got
 
03:36:12.050 --> 03:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
passed already in 1503. okay so but it
 
03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
needs a minor revision just to keep up
 
03:36:15.229 --> 03:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
with the UCC and that's what I'll be
 
03:36:17.510 --> 03:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
doing yeah the irony the timing of the
 
03:36:19.969 --> 03:36:19.979 align:start position:0%
the bills that that that's why we end up
 
03:36:23.210 --> 03:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
using 1503 rather than 1502. so I just
 
03:36:25.849 --> 03:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
we just kept 1502 you know you know in
 
03:36:28.809 --> 03:36:28.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:30.590 --> 03:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's right it was all about the
 
03:36:32.990 --> 03:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
physical note one had to get out the f02
 
03:36:35.750 --> 03:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
had to get had to be out in O3 we could
 
03:36:38.030 --> 03:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
hold on to and then
 
03:36:40.969 --> 03:36:40.979 align:start position:0%
put the UCC on representative Osborne
 
03:36:42.170 --> 03:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
was the one who was spreading that
 
03:36:45.769 --> 03:36:45.779 align:start position:0%
around the first thing you said when you
 
03:36:47.389 --> 03:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
I heard that was being spread around
 
03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
that I didn't I didn't try to I could
 
03:36:50.950 --> 03:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
attribute it
 
03:36:52.849 --> 03:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
fortunately he was strapped down because
 
03:36:55.010 --> 03:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
some of them might get hurt
 
03:36:58.870 --> 03:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
I was on uh some pretty strong paintings
 
03:37:02.030 --> 03:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
but I'm still going to drop his name and
 
03:37:03.889 --> 03:37:03.899 align:start position:0%
uh and then I went to the wedding and
 
03:37:08.450 --> 03:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
and then up in Jackson and uh he was the
 
03:37:12.410 --> 03:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
the the the the bride's dad was the one
 
03:37:14.030 --> 03:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
who had actually contacted me for the
 
03:37:16.910 --> 03:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
steel and it was everything was good it
 
03:37:18.590 --> 03:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
was okay it was all he was all happy
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
happy because we you know we had caved
 
03:37:23.210 --> 03:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
in and and that's what committee of
 
03:37:24.769 --> 03:37:24.779 align:start position:0%
conferences are all about that's right
 
03:37:27.110 --> 03:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
you can do good work now we can talk to
 
03:37:28.370 --> 03:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
some of the other community conferences
 
03:37:30.650 --> 03:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
which I did make everybody happy but
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
that one I made people no you did not
 
03:37:35.929 --> 03:37:35.939 align:start position:0%
make everybody happy on others so yes
 
03:37:38.210 --> 03:37:38.220 align:start position:0%

will note I got a card from the uh
 
03:37:50.570 --> 03:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
Democrats on our committee I really
 
03:37:52.490 --> 03:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
appreciated that but not from the
 
03:37:57.229 --> 03:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
Republicans other other Patrice think I
 
03:37:59.269 --> 03:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
Vice chairperson sent me two cards so
 
03:38:01.309 --> 03:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
that was you made it up for it you made
 
03:38:03.110 --> 03:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
up for it
 
03:38:06.290 --> 03:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
okay so representative will make the
 
03:38:08.030 --> 03:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
motion to not recommend for future
 
03:38:08.040 --> 03:38:09.650 align:start position:0%
motion to not recommend for future
legislation

03:38:09.650 --> 03:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
03:38:12.830 --> 03:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh now let's do our favorite
 
03:38:15.710 --> 03:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
subject liquor
 
03:38:19.070 --> 03:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
first up 1556 relative to on-premise
 
03:38:20.929 --> 03:38:20.939 align:start position:0%
off-premise sales at a beverage
 
03:38:23.150 --> 03:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturer facility
 
03:38:26.030 --> 03:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
so I if I recall correctly this was an
 
03:38:29.450 --> 03:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
issue of if that after you've been on in
 
03:38:32.710 --> 03:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
the restaurant of a beer manufacturer
 
03:38:36.830 --> 03:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
and then uh on your way just before you
 
03:38:39.710 --> 03:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh pay your bill you say to the waiter
 
03:38:42.050 --> 03:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
gee I really like to have a six-pack to
 
03:38:43.510 --> 03:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
take home
 
03:38:46.969 --> 03:38:46.979 align:start position:0%
and the interpretation was that you
 
03:38:49.990 --> 03:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't do that you had to then go to
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
across a wall or go somewhere else to
 
03:38:55.729 --> 03:38:55.739 align:start position:0%
make that separate transaction and the
 
03:38:57.710 --> 03:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission promised to fix this
 
03:39:00.170 --> 03:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
problem and
 
03:39:04.250 --> 03:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
we're all good right good so
 
03:39:06.050 --> 03:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
so we don't need that
 
03:39:08.809 --> 03:39:08.819 align:start position:0%
who would like to make that motion it
 
03:39:12.410 --> 03:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
was in for two seconds yep okay
 
03:39:14.349 --> 03:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
HB 416 allowing hobby distillation of
 
03:39:18.479 --> 03:39:20.330 align:start position:0%
HB 416 allowing hobby distillation of
Liquors

03:39:20.330 --> 03:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
Liquors
 
03:39:23.030 --> 03:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
so do we we ever figure out what it
 
03:39:27.050 --> 03:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:28.790 --> 03:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
do we ever figure out what it what it
 
03:39:30.769 --> 03:39:30.779 align:start position:0%
was to get an actual Federal ex might
 
03:39:33.229 --> 03:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
might look to the number so what it was
 
03:39:37.670 --> 03:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
like 500 a year but I I wasn't sure
 
03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:47.929 --> 03:39:47.939 align:start position:0%
we never really pursue how much it just
 
03:39:50.150 --> 03:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
to get that federal license right I mean
 
03:39:51.590 --> 03:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
because we require you to get the
 
03:39:53.990 --> 03:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
federal license to distill in New
 
03:39:54.000 --> 03:39:54.710 align:start position:0%
federal license to distill in New
Hampshire

03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:39:57.650 --> 03:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
so that that's really the threshold how
 
03:39:58.969 --> 03:39:58.979 align:start position:0%
much is it for a New Hampshire license
 
03:40:01.729 --> 03:40:01.739 align:start position:0%
that you're
 
03:40:14.349 --> 03:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:17.090 --> 03:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
right we did
 
03:40:19.070 --> 03:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
so we made it even
 
03:40:23.210 --> 03:40:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and why don't you come sit in front
 
03:40:27.050 --> 03:40:27.060 align:start position:0%
so you can talk in the mic and so all
 
03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
the world can hear you or I have Mark
 
03:40:31.130 --> 03:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
03:40:33.170 --> 03:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
because that's the the best title you
 
03:40:40.010 --> 03:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:46.670 --> 03:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:51.050 --> 03:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:52.490 --> 03:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
right they'll leave him back there
 
03:40:54.290 --> 03:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
because he's just a lawyer
 
03:40:57.110 --> 03:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
so why don't you introduce everybody so
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
we all know who they are here
 
03:41:00.650 --> 03:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
hello everybody thank you again Mr
 
03:41:02.630 --> 03:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
chairman uh for the record my name is
 
03:41:05.150 --> 03:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
Mark armagedian I'm the chief and
 
03:41:07.130 --> 03:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
director of The Liquor commission's
 
03:41:09.769 --> 03:41:09.779 align:start position:0%
Division of enforcement licensing with
 
03:41:13.550 --> 03:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
me today behind me is uh deputy director
 
03:41:15.790 --> 03:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
and deputy chief Danielle Elston
 
03:41:18.769 --> 03:41:18.779 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant Matt Culver uh who's in
 
03:41:20.630 --> 03:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
charge of administration he's in charge
 
03:41:23.570 --> 03:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
of Licensing for those questions these
 
03:41:25.309 --> 03:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
are our new
 
03:41:30.710 --> 03:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh I'm spacing out who just retired
 
03:41:35.389 --> 03:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
so Scott Dunn is Danielle now right
 
03:41:38.090 --> 03:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
Matt has been where he is right but who
 
03:41:40.969 --> 03:41:40.979 align:start position:0%
yeah so when Danielle actually was
 
03:41:44.450 --> 03:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
promoted Ben Williams is now in charge
 
03:41:46.729 --> 03:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
of field investigations okay
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
the licensure who um I'm spacing on the
 
03:41:53.170 --> 03:41:53.180 align:start position:0%
name who who am I think he just retired
 
03:41:55.729 --> 03:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
yeah which would be under Matt's command
 
03:41:58.969 --> 03:41:58.979 align:start position:0%
under him right okay so yes and what we
 
03:42:00.229 --> 03:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
have done all I know is all the
 
03:42:02.269 --> 03:42:02.279 align:start position:0%
licensees would always use his name and
 
03:42:05.929 --> 03:42:05.939 align:start position:0%
because as you know Mr chairman we we
 
03:42:07.849 --> 03:42:07.859 align:start position:0%
have done a huge restructure I think
 
03:42:09.469 --> 03:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
everybody here and and thank you
 
03:42:11.870 --> 03:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
everybody for being part of it
 
03:42:14.090 --> 03:42:14.100 align:start position:0%
um and we've been very transparent with
 
03:42:16.370 --> 03:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
it what we have done uh one of the
 
03:42:19.250 --> 03:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
things we recognized in auditing was we
 
03:42:22.370 --> 03:42:22.380 align:start position:0%
that our licensing group has gone from
 
03:42:24.229 --> 03:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
when I walked in the door six years ago
 
03:42:28.729 --> 03:42:28.739 align:start position:0%
of 4 800 up to 6400 today so we needed
 
03:42:30.889 --> 03:42:30.899 align:start position:0%
more people and and we weren't get
 
03:42:32.570 --> 03:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
getting more people because of the
 
03:42:34.670 --> 03:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
economic time so we had to do some
 
03:42:36.889 --> 03:42:36.899 align:start position:0%
restructuring and reallocating of
 
03:42:39.170 --> 03:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
resources so what we did was that Jim
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
barbudi position is now a auditor uh to
 
03:42:46.370 --> 03:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
help us out with that workload
 
03:42:49.670 --> 03:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
um which falls under the sergeant now
 
03:42:53.929 --> 03:42:53.939 align:start position:0%
um we had already which is on under mats
 
03:42:56.450 --> 03:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
command so restructuring reallocating
 
03:42:59.510 --> 03:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
resources being fiscally responsible I
 
03:43:02.030 --> 03:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
think we checked every box off along the
 
03:43:05.269 --> 03:43:05.279 align:start position:0%
way but uh but I thank you for the
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity and thank you for allowing
 
03:43:10.729 --> 03:43:10.739 align:start position:0%
me to bring the uh the team as you know
 
03:43:14.030 --> 03:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
this is a new team uh team that we put
 
03:43:16.090 --> 03:43:16.100 align:start position:0%
together within the last six years
 
03:43:20.050 --> 03:43:20.060 align:start position:0%
to to address some of your concerns
 
03:43:22.250 --> 03:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that came out in
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
the audit some of the concerns that we
 
03:43:25.870 --> 03:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
have spoke about individually
 
03:43:29.269 --> 03:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
and I believe at this point at this
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
juncture we have fulfilled all those
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
needs to include as Law changes we have
 
03:43:38.630 --> 03:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
to change the rules that apply to them
 
03:43:40.550 --> 03:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
which is something that felt a little
 
03:43:42.769 --> 03:43:42.779 align:start position:0%
short prior to my existence here so
 
03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
these are these are things that we are
 
03:43:49.150 --> 03:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
very aware of today we are very aware of
 
03:43:53.809 --> 03:43:53.819 align:start position:0%
the necessity for this division Vision
 
03:43:57.290 --> 03:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
um and and what what its uh Prime
 
03:43:59.990 --> 03:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
function is between the book markers of
 
03:44:02.630 --> 03:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
its prime function and not to get caught
 
03:44:05.269 --> 03:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
up with the uh items that traditional
 
03:44:08.929 --> 03:44:08.939 align:start position:0%
law enforcement may do on a daily basis
 
03:44:12.950 --> 03:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
um we have we have a niche so
 
03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
um but your question on the distilling
 
03:44:18.729 --> 03:44:18.739 align:start position:0%
so I'm jumping a little bit on you yeah
 
03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
I keep going to the last build you put a
 
03:44:21.600 --> 03:44:22.750 align:start position:0%
I keep going to the last build you put a
microphone

03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
03:44:25.370 --> 03:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
you put a microphone let's do the easy
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
ones first come on that's it so what is
 
03:44:30.290 --> 03:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
the license now that would be able to
 
03:44:33.290 --> 03:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
talk to us about the licensing pricing
 
03:44:33.300 --> 03:44:34.750 align:start position:0%
talk to us about the licensing pricing
okay

03:44:34.750 --> 03:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:44:38.929 --> 03:44:38.939 align:start position:0%
so the legislation that we just passed
 
03:44:38.939 --> 03:44:40.910 align:start position:0%
so the legislation that we just passed
we

03:44:40.910 --> 03:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:44:43.670 --> 03:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
made getting a state
 
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
license for stealing for someone who
 
03:44:48.469 --> 03:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
does a de minimis amount right which is
 
03:44:51.889 --> 03:44:51.899 align:start position:0%
300 and thank you chairman it's 300 it
 
03:44:53.630 --> 03:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
goes down it's on the tiered system from
 
03:44:53.640 --> 03:44:55.729 align:start position:0%
goes down it's on the tiered system from
1692

03:44:55.729 --> 03:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
1692
 
03:44:57.349 --> 03:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
um all the way down to 300 based on
 
03:45:00.590 --> 03:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
three products right so that state
 
03:45:03.830 --> 03:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
license for like a hobbyist type would
 
03:45:08.929 --> 03:45:08.939 align:start position:0%
be 300 but from 1692 correct okay
 
03:45:12.530 --> 03:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
so that that's a
 
03:45:17.650 --> 03:45:17.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:20.630 --> 03:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
anybody have any other questions about
 
03:45:22.849 --> 03:45:22.859 align:start position:0%
how anybody can be a home distiller for
 
03:45:27.170 --> 03:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:28.490 --> 03:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
but you still need the federal license
 
03:45:31.370 --> 03:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
and some reason I had this 500 dollar in
 
03:45:33.410 --> 03:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
my in my head but I don't remember I
 
03:45:37.130 --> 03:45:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:39.410 --> 03:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
yes representative Bartlett thanks Mr
 
03:45:39.420 --> 03:45:40.190 align:start position:0%
yes representative Bartlett thanks Mr
chair

03:45:40.190 --> 03:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:45:42.229 --> 03:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
as I recall
 
03:45:48.429 --> 03:45:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:48.439 --> 03:45:50.150 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:45:50.150 --> 03:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:53.330 --> 03:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
okay hobbyists distilling High liquor
 
03:45:55.550 --> 03:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
well that would be the reason why why is
 
03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
it that the feds
 
03:46:02.269 --> 03:46:02.279 align:start position:0%
are are so zealous about just home
 
03:46:05.330 --> 03:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
distilling was that what could it you
 
03:46:07.130 --> 03:46:07.140 align:start position:0%
know are you gonna make moonshine that
 
03:46:09.070 --> 03:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
poisons people right
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
so we as a committee have not been in
 
03:46:14.210 --> 03:46:14.220 align:start position:0%
favor of this
 
03:46:16.969 --> 03:46:16.979 align:start position:0%
uh I would have to say that
 
03:46:19.849 --> 03:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't I myself personally never got
 
03:46:22.670 --> 03:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
into worrying about moonshine because I
 
03:46:24.110 --> 03:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
mean I'm glad you're not distilling at
 
03:46:27.100 --> 03:46:27.110 align:start position:0%
the Castle I I am not just
 
03:46:27.110 --> 03:46:29.269 align:start position:0%
the Castle I I am not just
[Laughter]

03:46:29.269 --> 03:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:46:30.469 --> 03:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
and you know because you could buy
 
03:46:33.170 --> 03:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
distilling equipment you know off of
 
03:46:33.180 --> 03:46:35.110 align:start position:0%
distilling equipment you know off of
Amazon

03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
Amazon
 
03:46:38.330 --> 03:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
too come on
 
03:46:42.349 --> 03:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
but um but yeah so obviously your people
 
03:46:43.849 --> 03:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
you know you do it and you do it your
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
homie and
 
03:46:49.070 --> 03:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
hmm the ATF is not knocking on your door
 
03:46:50.570 --> 03:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
and to see whether what you're doing at
 
03:46:53.150 --> 03:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
home and the issue is always that the
 
03:46:56.150 --> 03:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
the Temptation that you make too much
 
03:46:58.610 --> 03:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
and be you know wanting to try to sell
 
03:47:00.170 --> 03:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
it to somebody so the liquor
 
03:47:04.670 --> 03:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:06.769 --> 03:47:06.779 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry and I I thought Matt was
 
03:47:06.779 --> 03:47:08.750 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry and I I thought Matt was
talking

03:47:08.750 --> 03:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
talking
 
03:47:11.690 --> 03:47:11.700 align:start position:0%
speak to the microphone thanks that we
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
would uh oppose this uh just due to the
 
03:47:17.929 --> 03:47:17.939 align:start position:0%
safety concerns that we do have and and
 
03:47:21.170 --> 03:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
we're talking ABB we're talking alcohol
 
03:47:22.969 --> 03:47:22.979 align:start position:0%
um volume
 
03:47:25.309 --> 03:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
um and the proof of a bottle there's no
 
03:47:27.650 --> 03:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
way for us to tell that
 
03:47:29.570 --> 03:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
um on the federal level that is being
 
03:47:33.410 --> 03:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
tested but uh home distilling has that
 
03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
breaches that safety concern that we've
 
03:47:39.469 --> 03:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
always had if somebody has
 
03:47:41.450 --> 03:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
um some information on how that could be
 
03:47:44.630 --> 03:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
done safely I'd be all ears to listen to
 
03:47:45.950 --> 03:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
that and the commission would be all
 
03:47:47.330 --> 03:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
ears to listen to that and the
 
03:47:53.229 --> 03:47:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:56.510 --> 03:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
it it would only be over your opposition
 
03:47:58.849 --> 03:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
if the legislature passed it absolutely
 
03:48:00.170 --> 03:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
right and I think and that kind of
 
03:48:02.690 --> 03:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
rationales we're going from the 1600
 
03:48:05.929 --> 03:48:05.939 align:start position:0%
down to 300 is you know that in terms of
 
03:48:08.570 --> 03:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
the compliance you know we know we just
 
03:48:09.889 --> 03:48:09.899 align:start position:0%
need to know who you are and what you're
 
03:48:12.229 --> 03:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
doing and and you're doing it safely and
 
03:48:15.170 --> 03:48:15.180 align:start position:0%
doing it safely so that's representative
 
03:48:15.180 --> 03:48:16.429 align:start position:0%
doing it safely so that's representative
Abramson

03:48:16.429 --> 03:48:16.439 align:start position:0%
Abramson
 
03:48:18.110 --> 03:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
um if I recall correctly
 
03:48:19.969 --> 03:48:19.979 align:start position:0%
um correct me if I'm wrong I
 
03:48:22.809 --> 03:48:22.819 align:start position:0%
sorry I missed myself
 
03:48:26.450 --> 03:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
was the concerns that were mentioned in
 
03:48:26.460 --> 03:48:28.190 align:start position:0%
was the concerns that were mentioned in
the

03:48:28.190 --> 03:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:30.710 --> 03:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
um executive session why we chose to to
 
03:48:32.750 --> 03:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
retain this was something about Federal
 
03:48:34.429 --> 03:48:34.439 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction versus State jurisdiction
 
03:48:35.929 --> 03:48:35.939 align:start position:0%
if there's already a federal law on the
 
03:48:38.570 --> 03:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
matter do we need a state law
 
03:48:40.910 --> 03:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
should we should we or State Licensing
 
03:48:42.530 --> 03:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
scheme or should we repeal that just
 
03:48:44.450 --> 03:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
fall back on the federal version and
 
03:48:45.889 --> 03:48:45.899 align:start position:0%
this one I I know that other state
 
03:48:47.929 --> 03:48:47.939 align:start position:0%
legislatures have had to contend with
 
03:48:51.590 --> 03:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
that question also so I'll be going back
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
over this bill and talking to the
 
03:48:54.950 --> 03:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
sponsors again and getting their take on
 
03:48:57.349 --> 03:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
that obviously and if you would like
 
03:48:57.359 --> 03:48:58.849 align:start position:0%
that obviously and if you would like
representative

03:48:58.849 --> 03:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and I know the other uh sponsors
 
03:49:04.849 --> 03:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
um if you would like to have a side
 
03:49:07.070 --> 03:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
meeting prior to that to talk about this
 
03:49:09.650 --> 03:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
that we're all like with everything else
 
03:49:11.750 --> 03:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
we're we're all ears
 
03:49:20.570 --> 03:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:23.590 --> 03:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
about um new hobby um
 
03:49:26.750 --> 03:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
distilleries or distillers
 
03:49:29.570 --> 03:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
um are they able to sell the product no
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
not for personal use right because a
 
03:49:38.090 --> 03:49:38.100 align:start position:0%

03:50:00.969 --> 03:50:00.979 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:50:03.950 --> 03:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
bring the motion to what
 
03:50:22.570 --> 03:50:22.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:22.580 --> 03:50:24.469 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:50:24.469 --> 03:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:26.870 --> 03:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
give the background on this so what some
 
03:50:29.389 --> 03:50:29.399 align:start position:0%
of the mem okay so summarize what it is
 
03:50:31.490 --> 03:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
we go into convenience stores out on the
 
03:50:31.500 --> 03:50:32.809 align:start position:0%
we go into convenience stores out on the
Seacoast

03:50:32.809 --> 03:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
Seacoast
 
03:50:34.610 --> 03:50:34.620 align:start position:0%
um and small Grocers and they primarily
 
03:50:34.620 --> 03:50:35.870 align:start position:0%
um and small Grocers and they primarily
sell

03:50:35.870 --> 03:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
sell
 
03:50:40.130 --> 03:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
beer wine tobacco and uh
 
03:50:43.370 --> 03:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
consumers would go in and see for years
 
03:50:44.690 --> 03:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
and years and years
 
03:50:48.190 --> 03:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
Dusty Kansas spam Eight dollar box of
 
03:50:50.269 --> 03:50:50.279 align:start position:0%
Cheerios sitting there until it's
 
03:50:52.429 --> 03:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
expiration date
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
loaf of bread in the ice box and what
 
03:50:56.389 --> 03:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
have you and they would they would tell
 
03:50:57.950 --> 03:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
us the stories about how they would have
 
03:50:59.809 --> 03:50:59.819 align:start position:0%
to hold this till the expiration date
 
03:51:01.130 --> 03:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
throw it away
 
03:51:03.229 --> 03:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
then they would have to run down to
 
03:51:06.110 --> 03:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
Market Basket or local grocery store and
 
03:51:08.510 --> 03:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
they would have to go and get new
 
03:51:10.969 --> 03:51:10.979 align:start position:0%
merchandise and I thought and when I
 
03:51:13.190 --> 03:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
talked to Consumers about half of them
 
03:51:15.170 --> 03:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
from out of state
 
03:51:16.370 --> 03:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
um they would say that that's the most
 
03:51:18.290 --> 03:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
ridiculous thing ever this is Live Free
 
03:51:20.510 --> 03:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
or Die State they the the perception was
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
that this was ridiculous so we we talked
 
03:51:24.469 --> 03:51:24.479 align:start position:0%
in committee when this came up about
 
03:51:27.290 --> 03:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
what if we replaced that with
 
03:51:28.849 --> 03:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
you know who knows if there's an
 
03:51:28.859 --> 03:51:29.830 align:start position:0%
you know who knows if there's an
emergency

03:51:29.830 --> 03:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
03:51:33.710 --> 03:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
roadside flares uh candles if the power
 
03:51:35.389 --> 03:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
goes out if there's a natural disaster
 
03:51:37.490 --> 03:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
or first aid kit some you know something
 
03:51:40.969 --> 03:51:40.979 align:start position:0%
else uh instead of mandating things that
 
03:51:44.450 --> 03:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
don't get sold so the pushback that I I
 
03:51:47.030 --> 03:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
got uh I don't want to quote you but I
 
03:51:48.769 --> 03:51:48.779 align:start position:0%
believe it was that there's not a single
 
03:51:50.330 --> 03:51:50.340 align:start position:0%
grocery store or convenience store in
 
03:51:51.889 --> 03:51:51.899 align:start position:0%
the whole state that has Dusty cans of
 
03:51:54.710 --> 03:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
spam so I remember that something about
 
03:51:58.130 --> 03:51:58.140 align:start position:0%
that phone call and I was so
 
03:52:01.550 --> 03:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
flustered did I grab my phone but it was
 
03:52:03.950 --> 03:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
my other phone and I went down to the
 
03:52:05.990 --> 03:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
convenience store and I took pictures
 
03:52:07.610 --> 03:52:07.620 align:start position:0%
with permission and sure enough there
 
03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
were eight dollar box of Cheerios box of
 
03:52:12.050 --> 03:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
Hamburger Helper sitting there and they
 
03:52:13.370 --> 03:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
would go to their expiration date and
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
the other cashier would be like yeah as
 
03:52:17.090 --> 03:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
soon as these expire I have to take
 
03:52:18.889 --> 03:52:18.899 align:start position:0%
these and throw them away
 
03:52:21.710 --> 03:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
so I was assured that that never happens
 
03:52:22.969 --> 03:52:22.979 align:start position:0%
and then I went to the grocery
 
03:52:24.410 --> 03:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
convenience stores themselves and they
 
03:52:26.210 --> 03:52:26.220 align:start position:0%
said yes this this is still going on
 
03:52:28.070 --> 03:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
even to this day so I was going to print
 
03:52:29.510 --> 03:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
out photos and bring them in for the
 
03:52:32.389 --> 03:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
chair but uh I for some reason I got
 
03:52:33.769 --> 03:52:33.779 align:start position:0%
these mixed up and I thought this was
 
03:52:35.990 --> 03:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to happen tomorrow so if you don't
 
03:52:37.429 --> 03:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
mind I'll bring photos in for you
 
03:52:37.439 --> 03:52:39.530 align:start position:0%
mind I'll bring photos in for you
tomorrow

03:52:39.530 --> 03:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
03:52:40.969 --> 03:52:40.979 align:start position:0%
um because he doesn't believe me until
 
03:52:44.389 --> 03:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
he sees photos yes I like photos but I
 
03:52:45.650 --> 03:52:45.660 align:start position:0%
can also talk to some people at the
 
03:52:47.090 --> 03:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
convenience store maybe have him call
 
03:52:47.100 --> 03:52:47.809 align:start position:0%
convenience store maybe have him call
you

03:52:47.809 --> 03:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:52:49.729 --> 03:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
because this is still an ongoing thing
 
03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
on the Seacoast
 
03:52:53.990 --> 03:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and I there must be people like like
 
03:52:56.030 --> 03:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
spam over there because I can't find it
 
03:53:00.050 --> 03:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
on no anywhere else it gets thrown away
 
03:53:01.030 --> 03:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
no no
 
03:53:04.309 --> 03:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
where I am most of this stuff that's the
 
03:53:05.990 --> 03:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
Hawaiians over there so some members of
 
03:53:08.630 --> 03:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
the committee were interested in instead
 
03:53:11.410 --> 03:53:11.420 align:start position:0%
of the three thousand dollars in other
 
03:53:14.389 --> 03:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
condensed cans of milk and hamburger
 
03:53:15.950 --> 03:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
helper and Cheerios and fruit loops and
 
03:53:17.929 --> 03:53:17.939 align:start position:0%
whatnot some of them mentioned interest
 
03:53:20.870 --> 03:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
in well why don't we offer
 
03:53:23.870 --> 03:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
you know other items again non-alcohol
 
03:53:26.929 --> 03:53:26.939 align:start position:0%
non-tobacco items that that could be
 
03:53:28.370 --> 03:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
things people need for example an
 
03:53:30.050 --> 03:53:30.060 align:start position:0%
emergency first aid kits things that
 
03:53:32.269 --> 03:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
don't expire things if your car breaks
 
03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
down things if there's a natural
 
03:53:33.359 --> 03:53:34.969 align:start position:0%
down things if there's a natural
disaster

03:53:34.969 --> 03:53:34.979 align:start position:0%
disaster
 
03:53:36.410 --> 03:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
um and if members of the committee
 
03:53:38.090 --> 03:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
wanted to go forward with that I'm fine
 
03:53:41.210 --> 03:53:41.220 align:start position:0%
with that also but I I perceive the the
 
03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
perceive the law and what I got from
 
03:53:45.290 --> 03:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
feedback from constituents and neighbors
 
03:53:46.969 --> 03:53:46.979 align:start position:0%
and business people was that this was
 
03:53:48.650 --> 03:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
probably the most ridiculous law on the
 
03:53:50.929 --> 03:53:50.939 align:start position:0%
books and should just be completely done
 
03:53:52.130 --> 03:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
away with but if members of the
 
03:53:53.990 --> 03:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee want to replace the dusty
 
03:53:56.570 --> 03:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
Kansas spam with uh prepared foods I
 
03:53:57.950 --> 03:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
think you said nachos and other things
 
03:54:00.889 --> 03:54:00.899 align:start position:0%
that would apply that's all I see meals
 
03:54:03.190 --> 03:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
and room Stacks but I don't see any I so
 
03:54:06.050 --> 03:54:06.060 align:start position:0%
in the old days I used to see eggs and
 
03:54:08.210 --> 03:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
bacon they actually they don't have that
 
03:54:10.309 --> 03:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
anymore they stop carrying eggs and
 
03:54:13.490 --> 03:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
bacon there's one they have Eggo waffles
 
03:54:15.469 --> 03:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
there's a gas station and they have
 
03:54:18.530 --> 03:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
sausages it still has hot dogs and
 
03:54:19.969 --> 03:54:19.979 align:start position:0%
hamburgers that apply the meals and room
 
03:54:22.130 --> 03:54:22.140 align:start position:0%
Stacks nothing else none of the other
 
03:54:23.809 --> 03:54:23.819 align:start position:0%
stores going all the way up none of them
 
03:54:25.849 --> 03:54:25.859 align:start position:0%
have anything on rollers
 
03:54:28.429 --> 03:54:28.439 align:start position:0%
there's not no heated food at all right
 
03:54:31.130 --> 03:54:31.140 align:start position:0%
but I'm right that's room and meals
 
03:54:33.050 --> 03:54:33.060 align:start position:0%
you've been on rollers room and meals I
 
03:54:35.389 --> 03:54:35.399 align:start position:0%
would invite you to come down to Hampton
 
03:54:38.150 --> 03:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
Hampton Falls Seabrook take a look at my
 
03:54:39.290 --> 03:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
district especially come down to
 
03:54:40.910 --> 03:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
Seabrook and go down Route One there we
 
03:54:42.889 --> 03:54:42.899 align:start position:0%
do have a lot of convenience stores and
 
03:54:45.410 --> 03:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
see if you can find any hot dog rollers
 
03:54:46.790 --> 03:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
because we don't have anything that's
 
03:54:48.590 --> 03:54:48.600 align:start position:0%
under I wasn't suggesting hot dog
 
03:54:53.650 --> 03:54:53.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:56.990 --> 03:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
that was the interesting twist rooms and
 
03:55:00.650 --> 03:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
meals food is not included in the 3000.
 
03:55:02.630 --> 03:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
it was a complete opposite of that right
 
03:55:05.210 --> 03:55:05.220 align:start position:0%
so okay so
 
03:55:07.429 --> 03:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
we felt that this was a whole other can
 
03:55:09.650 --> 03:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
of worms to open not that you should
 
03:55:11.450 --> 03:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
open a can of worms I know this is going
 
03:55:13.309 --> 03:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
to go somewhere they sell worms
 
03:55:15.889 --> 03:55:15.899 align:start position:0%
if you if members no they might have a
 
03:55:17.870 --> 03:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
fish it has to be a fish tackle store so
 
03:55:19.070 --> 03:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
they would have worms they would have
 
03:55:20.510 --> 03:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
night crawlers
 
03:55:22.130 --> 03:55:22.140 align:start position:0%
if members of the committee want to
 
03:55:26.150 --> 03:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
expand what's counted under the 3000 or
 
03:55:28.429 --> 03:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
change the wording I'm open to going
 
03:55:30.710 --> 03:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
back to legislative Services drafting an
 
03:55:32.450 --> 03:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
amendment and expanding what you can
 
03:55:34.550 --> 03:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
have in here
 
03:55:37.370 --> 03:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
representative Evan
 
03:55:39.590 --> 03:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
it was already touched on uh my
 
03:55:41.689 --> 03:55:41.699 align:start position:0%
recollection we did discuss uh prepared
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
food and I forget why that was either a
 
03:55:46.189 --> 03:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
good or a bad idea right but I'd be in
 
03:55:48.769 --> 03:55:48.779 align:start position:0%
favor of expanding it to prepared food I
 
03:55:50.630 --> 03:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
think that would make sense preparing
 
03:55:55.969 --> 03:55:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:55.979 --> 03:55:59.450 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:55:59.450 --> 03:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:03.410 --> 03:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
oh no representative Burroughs my
 
03:56:06.410 --> 03:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
question is they don't have to buy spam
 
03:56:08.030 --> 03:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
you know why don't they buy something
 
03:56:10.429 --> 03:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
like chocolate that that's gonna sell I
 
03:56:12.889 --> 03:56:12.899 align:start position:0%
mean nobody wants to eat Spam the reason
 
03:56:14.530 --> 03:56:14.540 align:start position:0%
that they gave was
 
03:56:16.610 --> 03:56:16.620 align:start position:0%
uh they don't want to sell anything from
 
03:56:18.050 --> 03:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
there anyway so they just get a bunch of
 
03:56:19.969 --> 03:56:19.979 align:start position:0%
stuff that sits there on the Shelf until
 
03:56:21.410 --> 03:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
it hits its expiration date they throw
 
03:56:23.689 --> 03:56:23.699 align:start position:0%
it away they go get some new stuff it
 
03:56:26.689 --> 03:56:26.699 align:start position:0%
it's so I I we can ask the license
 
03:56:29.170 --> 03:56:29.180 align:start position:0%
people but I believe
 
03:56:33.290 --> 03:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
under our statute they have to show that
 
03:56:35.450 --> 03:56:35.460 align:start position:0%
they have bought three thousand dollars
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
worth of inventory on an annual basis so
 
03:56:41.710 --> 03:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
they it so
 
03:56:43.969 --> 03:56:43.979 align:start position:0%
and I guess
 
03:56:46.610 --> 03:56:46.620 align:start position:0%
in your experience have you ever seen
 
03:56:48.530 --> 03:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
someone showing you the slip that said
 
03:56:50.450 --> 03:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
they bought it at Market Basket rather
 
03:56:53.809 --> 03:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
than from Cisco or well no they're on
 
03:56:56.929 --> 03:56:56.939 align:start position:0%
strike right absolutely and thank you
 
03:56:59.630 --> 03:56:59.640 align:start position:0%
for the question they they do buy it at
 
03:57:02.269 --> 03:57:02.279 align:start position:0%
um other retail stores and bring it into
 
03:57:05.269 --> 03:57:05.279 align:start position:0%
their stores for for resale I think that
 
03:57:08.210 --> 03:57:08.220 align:start position:0%
an important item to note here is
 
03:57:10.670 --> 03:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
historically speaking this three
 
03:57:13.130 --> 03:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar Wholesale grocery stock
 
03:57:15.830 --> 03:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
came in
 
03:57:19.729 --> 03:57:19.739 align:start position:0%
um to help prevent the package stores
 
03:57:22.729 --> 03:57:22.739 align:start position:0%
where you would have 16 coolers of beer
 
03:57:26.330 --> 03:57:26.340 align:start position:0%
in wine and have a box of Slim Jims on
 
03:57:28.729 --> 03:57:28.739 align:start position:0%
your counter so the legislation at the
 
03:57:30.290 --> 03:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
time that they passed the original bill
 
03:57:32.510 --> 03:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
was to say okay we're forcing you to be
 
03:57:33.950 --> 03:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
a legitimate grocery store or
 
03:57:35.990 --> 03:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
convenience store and that was the
 
03:57:37.969 --> 03:57:37.979 align:start position:0%
intent and there is no doubt there's
 
03:57:40.250 --> 03:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
probably licensees throughout the state
 
03:57:42.170 --> 03:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
that have
 
03:57:42.180 --> 03:57:43.670 align:start position:0%
that have
um

03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:47.630 --> 03:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh stretched the intent of that quite
 
03:57:50.889 --> 03:57:50.899 align:start position:0%
quite a bit but we're talking about 1411
 
03:57:56.570 --> 03:57:56.580 align:start position:0%
licensees that this applies to so the
 
03:57:58.389 --> 03:57:58.399 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
03:58:01.070 --> 03:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
licensees who are are taking advantage
 
03:58:04.729 --> 03:58:04.739 align:start position:0%
of that portion I I think are relatively
 
03:58:04.739 --> 03:58:06.769 align:start position:0%
of that portion I I think are relatively
small

03:58:06.769 --> 03:58:06.779 align:start position:0%
small
 
03:58:09.590 --> 03:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
but the um and I guess in terms of the
 
03:58:12.349 --> 03:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
conversation from what he has said and
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing is that
 
03:58:18.530 --> 03:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
in terms of the inventory we were we
 
03:58:20.530 --> 03:58:20.540 align:start position:0%
were focused on food
 
03:58:23.870 --> 03:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
and mainly because we probably were
 
03:58:26.090 --> 03:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
focused in on we have a food requirement
 
03:58:30.170 --> 03:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
for our on-premise licensees that that
 
03:58:32.630 --> 03:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
should be a food requirement for an
 
03:58:35.210 --> 03:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
off-premise licensee but if we were to
 
03:58:37.610 --> 03:58:37.620 align:start position:0%
take it further and say okay if the
 
03:58:41.689 --> 03:58:41.699 align:start position:0%
off-premise licensee had motor oil and
 
03:58:45.469 --> 03:58:45.479 align:start position:0%
had candles and flashlights and other
 
03:58:49.370 --> 03:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
bottled water other things that would be
 
03:58:52.550 --> 03:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
good for emergencies that you know would
 
03:58:55.610 --> 03:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
that could that uh be a new way to look
 
03:58:59.269 --> 03:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
at that three thousand dollars I Mr
 
03:59:00.950 --> 03:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't think we ever said that
 
03:59:03.170 --> 03:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
these uh convenience stores let's call
 
03:59:05.750 --> 03:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
them uh our combination licenses
 
03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
licensees can't carry other items but I
 
03:59:12.469 --> 03:59:12.479 align:start position:0%
think we're losing our our focus on the
 
03:59:14.389 --> 03:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
fact here and that's we're breaching
 
03:59:19.030 --> 03:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
safety when we do not sell food in those
 
03:59:22.250 --> 03:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
establishments I can't the the group
 
03:59:24.050 --> 03:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
that you have talked to representative
 
03:59:26.150 --> 03:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
to be quite honest about it they're my
 
03:59:28.969 --> 03:59:28.979 align:start position:0%
focal group on education because they
 
03:59:32.570 --> 03:59:32.580 align:start position:0%
don't recognize that on an empty stomach
 
03:59:35.630 --> 03:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
if food is not not whether it's prepared
 
03:59:38.510 --> 03:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
or not but if it isn't available to the
 
03:59:41.090 --> 03:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
patron that the alcohol that they
 
03:59:44.030 --> 03:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
consume could do a quick dump the a
 
03:59:45.650 --> 03:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
quick dump into their small intestines
 
03:59:46.910 --> 03:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
and end up in their blood system
 
03:59:49.790 --> 03:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
immediately which are those people as we
 
03:59:52.670 --> 03:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
remember and I apologize for my back
 
03:59:54.650 --> 03:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
um those those people that remember that
 
03:59:57.650 --> 03:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
could be quite fine at one point and
 
04:00:00.050 --> 04:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
then all of a sudden out of nowhere they
 
04:00:02.689 --> 04:00:02.699 align:start position:0%
are extremely intoxicated and it's
 
04:00:04.010 --> 04:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
because there's no food there's no
 
04:00:06.590 --> 04:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
coffee filter in their system and this
 
04:00:11.030 --> 04:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
breaches one of the two of three uh
 
04:00:12.889 --> 04:00:12.899 align:start position:0%
items that I've always said in the last
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
six years Community safety we only
 
04:00:16.969 --> 04:00:16.979 align:start position:0%
regulate to the level of community
 
04:00:21.170 --> 04:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
safety Industry Safety and to keep an
 
04:00:22.849 --> 04:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
eye on our vulnerable vulnerable age
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
group and when you do not have some sort
 
04:00:29.570 --> 04:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
of food I get it flares I love it
 
04:00:34.010 --> 04:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh insta inflate for tires I think they
 
04:00:36.590 --> 04:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
should be there but you can't first aid
 
04:00:38.929 --> 04:00:38.939 align:start position:0%
kit but you can't take away from the
 
04:00:42.410 --> 04:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
food that is actually creating a barrier
 
04:00:44.590 --> 04:00:44.600 align:start position:0%
of absorption into the body
 
04:00:47.090 --> 04:00:47.100 align:start position:0%
physiologically you're causing all kinds
 
04:00:49.070 --> 04:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
of problems that we'll see we'll see the
 
04:00:51.290 --> 04:00:51.300 align:start position:0%
adverse effects on our highways and we
 
04:00:52.790 --> 04:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
don't want this I know this group
 
04:00:54.889 --> 04:00:54.899 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to do that my group doesn't
 
04:00:56.510 --> 04:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
want to do that I know the group I came
 
04:00:58.130 --> 04:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
from Department of Safety doesn't want
 
04:01:00.590 --> 04:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
to see that so that that is the only
 
04:01:03.290 --> 04:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
reason why it's there so my concern is
 
04:01:05.090 --> 04:01:05.100 align:start position:0%
that there are people that think this is
 
04:01:08.630 --> 04:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
stupid and stupid's a heavy word that's
 
04:01:10.910 --> 04:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
my education that those are the people I
 
04:01:13.370 --> 04:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
need to get to with education
 
04:01:17.269 --> 04:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh I appreciate it though so I just I've
 
04:01:21.530 --> 04:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
never well I've never seen someone
 
04:01:24.769 --> 04:01:24.779 align:start position:0%
get a 30 pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon
 
04:01:28.010 --> 04:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
hit the road oh and while they're at it
 
04:01:30.050 --> 04:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
get a box of stroganoff
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
get an eight ball dollar boxes Froot
 
04:01:34.130 --> 04:01:34.140 align:start position:0%
Loops I've never seen it this what we're
 
04:01:37.849 --> 04:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
what I'm seeing and I've lived all over
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
the state some okay some places do
 
04:01:43.370 --> 04:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
actually sell this food
 
04:01:46.250 --> 04:01:46.260 align:start position:0%
but a lot of the grocery stores I see
 
04:01:48.050 --> 04:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
the food just sits there and they
 
04:01:49.670 --> 04:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
deliberately pick items to minimize
 
04:01:51.950 --> 04:01:51.960 align:start position:0%
their loss and minimize their work and
 
04:01:53.150 --> 04:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
it's just stuff that sits there till
 
04:01:55.309 --> 04:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
it's expiration date you throw it away
 
04:01:57.469 --> 04:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
and having food having food I hate
 
04:01:59.269 --> 04:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
seeing food wasted that's a personal pet
 
04:01:59.279 --> 04:02:01.070 align:start position:0%
seeing food wasted that's a personal pet
peeve

04:02:01.070 --> 04:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
peeve
 
04:02:02.870 --> 04:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
having stuff just sit on the shelves
 
04:02:04.370 --> 04:02:04.380 align:start position:0%
until it expires and then they throw it
 
04:02:06.410 --> 04:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
away and go to Market Basket Market
 
04:02:08.450 --> 04:02:08.460 align:start position:0%
baskets open until eight convenience
 
04:02:10.490 --> 04:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
store is open till nine
 
04:02:12.950 --> 04:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
I I can't see doing this just because
 
04:02:14.809 --> 04:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
there's a window of one hour where
 
04:02:16.429 --> 04:02:16.439 align:start position:0%
someone is a
 
04:02:18.889 --> 04:02:18.899 align:start position:0%
presumably drunk driver who hits it goes
 
04:02:20.630 --> 04:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
to a convenience store that's very far
 
04:02:22.070 --> 04:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
away from home
 
04:02:24.950 --> 04:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
and is going to down multiple beers on
 
04:02:26.150 --> 04:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
the way home
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
and then that that's going to be one
 
04:02:31.070 --> 04:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
percent safer with him holding a box of
 
04:02:33.830 --> 04:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
Hamburger Helper in there it I I can't
 
04:02:35.570 --> 04:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
see the logic of it here's a here's a
 
04:02:37.250 --> 04:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
question I have for you Max
 
04:02:39.410 --> 04:02:39.420 align:start position:0%
would you be okay
 
04:02:42.610 --> 04:02:42.620 align:start position:0%
with representative ammon's request that
 
04:02:44.990 --> 04:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
instead of having a three thousand
 
04:02:48.050 --> 04:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
dollar food uh requiring with this list
 
04:02:50.330 --> 04:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
of potential things that people have
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
that they have at least three thousand
 
04:02:56.689 --> 04:02:56.699 align:start position:0%
dollars of food that is a room in meals
 
04:02:59.929 --> 04:02:59.939 align:start position:0%
is taxable by rooms and meals and
 
04:03:02.570 --> 04:03:02.580 align:start position:0%
therefore it would be a snack it would
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
be that grinder it would be that burrito
 
04:03:09.050 --> 04:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
it would be I've seen even because
 
04:03:10.429 --> 04:03:10.439 align:start position:0%
that's something you might actually eat
 
04:03:12.110 --> 04:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
on the way home would you feel better
 
04:03:14.030 --> 04:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
about that I talked to one convenience
 
04:03:15.469 --> 04:03:15.479 align:start position:0%
store owner about that that very
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
question and um
 
04:03:19.550 --> 04:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
following the wording as well as I can
 
04:03:19.560 --> 04:03:20.469 align:start position:0%
following the wording as well as I can
remember

04:03:20.469 --> 04:03:20.479 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:03:22.910 --> 04:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
I thought it was they had hot dog
 
04:03:25.610 --> 04:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
rollers at one point and they couldn't
 
04:03:25.620 --> 04:03:26.630 align:start position:0%
rollers at one point and they couldn't
get

04:03:26.630 --> 04:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:03:28.910 --> 04:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
they they couldn't sell enough of those
 
04:03:31.550 --> 04:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
they lost money they finally gave up on
 
04:03:34.429 --> 04:03:34.439 align:start position:0%
it if we just narrowed it down and
 
04:03:36.290 --> 04:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
restricted it to only prepared foods
 
04:03:38.330 --> 04:03:38.340 align:start position:0%
that run to the meals and rooms tax that
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
would be an even heftier mandate for for
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
some businesses so it would be an even
 
04:03:44.510 --> 04:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
higher cost well they could do both but
 
04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
we're saying that include included
 
04:03:48.410 --> 04:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
because that was where the pushback was
 
04:03:50.929 --> 04:03:50.939 align:start position:0%
for the committee was that rooms and
 
04:03:53.950 --> 04:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
meals tax type food were not on the list
 
04:03:56.210 --> 04:03:56.220 align:start position:0%
and we're saying is well wait a second
 
04:03:58.490 --> 04:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
isn't that the whole point is to have
 
04:04:00.910 --> 04:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
food that they might actually
 
04:04:04.370 --> 04:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
grab and eat on their way home before
 
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
they open up that six-pack because
 
04:04:07.189 --> 04:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
they're going to wait till they get home
 
04:04:10.130 --> 04:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
before they have one of those hot dogs
 
04:04:11.750 --> 04:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of nice no no I don't know
 
04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
about hot dogs for you the only one I
 
04:04:15.830 --> 04:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
know who has hot dogs is Cumberland
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
Farms and Irvings you know the big the
 
04:04:21.110 --> 04:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
big guys have the hot dogs a lot of the
 
04:04:23.090 --> 04:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
when I in the ones I've seen I mean I've
 
04:04:25.969 --> 04:04:25.979 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of smaller ones I they
 
04:04:28.250 --> 04:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
actually have foods that you microwave
 
04:04:30.349 --> 04:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
and they have a microwave right there so
 
04:04:31.610 --> 04:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
you heat them right up and they have
 
04:04:34.010 --> 04:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
frozen burritos I've seen cheeseburgers
 
04:04:35.929 --> 04:04:35.939 align:start position:0%
I've seen I guess I haven't even seen a
 
04:04:37.849 --> 04:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
hot dog that you can microwave it and
 
04:04:39.650 --> 04:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
then they put it up so so we're talking
 
04:04:43.010 --> 04:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
about things that would be I mean I I
 
04:04:44.389 --> 04:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
guess the problem with it could be
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
danishes right danishes are taxables
 
04:04:49.490 --> 04:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals you could have some
 
04:04:51.530 --> 04:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
really you know High carbureted you know
 
04:04:53.090 --> 04:04:53.100 align:start position:0%
maybe some things are not so good for
 
04:04:56.630 --> 04:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
you but but the idea is that that allow
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
that three thousand dollars to be things
 
04:05:00.650 --> 04:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
that that it would be good things for
 
04:05:03.050 --> 04:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
them to be eating on the way well I'm
 
04:05:04.910 --> 04:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
willing to work with the representative
 
04:05:07.010 --> 04:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
Ammon and Terry let's see what
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative Terry has to say feedback
 
04:05:10.910 --> 04:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
from that well I just I didn't volunteer
 
04:05:13.429 --> 04:05:13.439 align:start position:0%
but I'm I want to add I want to make I
 
04:05:16.130 --> 04:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask a question it seems to me
 
04:05:20.030 --> 04:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
I hear the concerns here for safety uh
 
04:05:21.710 --> 04:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
I'm also hearing that uh the the
 
04:05:27.530 --> 04:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
proprieties of these stores are saying
 
04:05:29.750 --> 04:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
that they're not selling the product
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
that they're required to stock
 
04:05:36.650 --> 04:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
or presumably safety concerns
 
04:05:39.349 --> 04:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
so they're taking a hit because they're
 
04:05:42.050 --> 04:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
not selling the product well that would
 
04:05:43.969 --> 04:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
be a problem because they have to show
 
04:05:45.349 --> 04:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
that they have three thousand that's
 
04:05:47.330 --> 04:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
right so you must be selling something
 
04:05:51.710 --> 04:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
so so does it yes no they just have to
 
04:05:53.150 --> 04:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
have three thousand just ask that
 
04:05:55.790 --> 04:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
question and he said yes they must show
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis that they have sold
 
04:06:01.189 --> 04:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
three thousand you're saying that these
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
that's not if so so isn't the solution
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
yes let's hear clarification make sure I
 
04:06:09.410 --> 04:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
understand I didn't finish mine yes so
 
04:06:11.330 --> 04:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to finish so it would seem
 
04:06:14.030 --> 04:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
to me that the solution here to satisfy
 
04:06:15.950 --> 04:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
both safety and
 
04:06:18.530 --> 04:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
uh profitability all right we have two
 
04:06:21.050 --> 04:06:21.060 align:start position:0%
concerns here safety and profitability
 
04:06:24.889 --> 04:06:24.899 align:start position:0%
so uh we I would think that we would
 
04:06:28.429 --> 04:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
want to to ask the Proprietors what is
 
04:06:30.530 --> 04:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
it that you're carrying that's not
 
04:06:31.969 --> 04:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
selling and what is it that you're
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
carrying that you are selling and what
 
04:06:37.490 --> 04:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
more could we require or permit you to
 
04:06:40.750 --> 04:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
sell so that you wouldn't have to be
 
04:06:43.550 --> 04:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
going out and replacing boxes of
 
04:06:46.010 --> 04:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
Cheerios that you went to Market Basket
 
04:06:48.469 --> 04:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
to purchase to satisfy the three
 
04:06:51.710 --> 04:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar uh inventory uh
 
04:06:53.450 --> 04:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
requirement minimum
 
04:06:56.150 --> 04:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
and and so the question becomes for
 
04:06:57.950 --> 04:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
04:07:01.790 --> 04:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
how can you get to 3 000 at least and
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
have the stores actually selling not
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
only the product that's regulated but
 
04:07:10.490 --> 04:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
also the food that for safety concerns
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
are part of the regulations
 
04:07:16.010 --> 04:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
fair enough and and and then it becomes
 
04:07:18.110 --> 04:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
a consumer issue because you could still
 
04:07:20.570 --> 04:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
have people coming into that store you
 
04:07:22.130 --> 04:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
could have a hundred people a thousand
 
04:07:23.570 --> 04:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
people coming into that store and they
 
04:07:25.490 --> 04:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
don't care what you've got up there you
 
04:07:27.410 --> 04:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
you could have Twinkies up there or or
 
04:07:30.410 --> 04:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
or or or or dried hamburgers or whatever
 
04:07:33.349 --> 04:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
you know the unless it's the Rage or for
 
04:07:36.050 --> 04:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
for buying at a convenience store
 
04:07:37.610 --> 04:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
they're still not going to buy this
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
stuff but what we've done is we've
 
04:07:42.170 --> 04:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
satisfied Our concern that we have
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
provided the opportunity for people to
 
04:07:46.429 --> 04:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
actually purchase something to put into
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
their stomachs while they're consuming
 
04:07:50.929 --> 04:07:50.939 align:start position:0%
the the alcoholic beverages so
 
04:07:52.010 --> 04:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's going to come down to
 
04:07:54.410 --> 04:07:54.420 align:start position:0%
the consumer and our challenge is to
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
find products that we think that the
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
consumer will purchase in the
 
04:08:00.349 --> 04:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
convenience store and that's where we
 
04:08:02.090 --> 04:08:02.100 align:start position:0%
need help what are those products so
 
04:08:04.610 --> 04:08:04.620 align:start position:0%
that we can amend the list to include
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
those items does this make sense there
 
04:08:08.450 --> 04:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
are a couple that the commission can
 
04:08:10.010 --> 04:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
tell us maybe you could start by telling
 
04:08:13.130 --> 04:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
us what is on the list now so so thank
 
04:08:15.710 --> 04:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman representative thank you
 
04:08:17.689 --> 04:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
this is great feedback
 
04:08:20.450 --> 04:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
um and I think all of you know that uh
 
04:08:22.849 --> 04:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
the feedback is extremely positive and
 
04:08:25.370 --> 04:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
we take it to heart uh first and
 
04:08:29.330 --> 04:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
foremost uh snack foods are uh within
 
04:08:31.490 --> 04:08:31.500 align:start position:0%
liquor 40402.
 
04:08:34.189 --> 04:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
so they they sit in all this sits and
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
Rule already
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
so the stuff we're talking about doesn't
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
really need legislation it may need a
 
04:08:43.849 --> 04:08:43.859 align:start position:0%
tweak of the rule uh and gel card to get
 
04:08:46.130 --> 04:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
involved but that's it what's in what's
 
04:08:48.590 --> 04:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
in the rule now the one that would
 
04:08:51.410 --> 04:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
actually pick this the the prepared
 
04:08:53.990 --> 04:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
foods up would be snack foods
 
04:08:55.790 --> 04:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
um because I'm looking at bread meat
 
04:08:59.389 --> 04:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
products uh fresher can dairy products
 
04:09:01.610 --> 04:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
to include milk cereal products whether
 
04:09:04.849 --> 04:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
hot or cold vegetables uh Canada fresh
 
04:09:07.610 --> 04:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
fruits whether canned or fresh and snack
 
04:09:10.429 --> 04:09:10.439 align:start position:0%
foods which picks up the the foods that
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
you're talking about that are pre-made
 
04:09:16.070 --> 04:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
Foods on on the the roller but
 
04:09:19.309 --> 04:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
um this is something that uh Simon and
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
and our group have talked about this is
 
04:09:24.469 --> 04:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
not something that is wanted by the
 
04:09:25.689 --> 04:09:25.699 align:start position:0%
convenience stores
 
04:09:28.370 --> 04:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about well he
 
04:09:30.469 --> 04:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
represents big convenience stores I'm
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
assuming Max is talking about the small
 
04:09:36.950 --> 04:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
mom and pop one one store locations
 
04:09:36.960 --> 04:09:39.590 align:start position:0%
mom and pop one one store locations
representative

04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:09:41.870 --> 04:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
okay how many have are only one
 
04:09:41.880 --> 04:09:44.510 align:start position:0%
okay how many have are only one
locations

04:09:44.510 --> 04:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:44.520 --> 04:09:45.590 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:09:45.590 --> 04:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:09:45.600 --> 04:09:52.910 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

04:09:52.910 --> 04:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
yeah well you they're they're the big
 
04:09:58.010 --> 04:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
guys here but but I I think
 
04:10:01.610 --> 04:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
um to to be uh legislatively responsible
 
04:10:03.290 --> 04:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
from the liquor commission's point of
 
04:10:03.300 --> 04:10:04.309 align:start position:0%
from the liquor commission's point of
view

04:10:04.309 --> 04:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
view
 
04:10:06.370 --> 04:10:06.380 align:start position:0%
um we could clean this up and roll
 
04:10:08.689 --> 04:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
we appreciate that you could clean up
 
04:10:10.910 --> 04:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
and Rule I guess we we would I mean I
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
would just say just on just from what I
 
04:10:14.210 --> 04:10:14.220 align:start position:0%
just heard
 
04:10:16.130 --> 04:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
um my wife would say canned foods are
 
04:10:18.349 --> 04:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
not good and you should at least have
 
04:10:21.110 --> 04:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
Frozen Foods so maybe vegetables and
 
04:10:23.929 --> 04:10:23.939 align:start position:0%
that should be Frozen not canned but
 
04:10:27.429 --> 04:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
having said that the question is for
 
04:10:30.050 --> 04:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
representative Amerson because he will
 
04:10:32.030 --> 04:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
not be back next year so representative
 
04:10:34.309 --> 04:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
Terry is going to put in a bill for you
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
that you have to figure out what is it
 
04:10:42.050 --> 04:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
that uh in the food category
 
04:10:44.150 --> 04:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
okay we've just agreed you've just
 
04:10:46.309 --> 04:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
discussed that we don't want to have all
 
04:10:47.750 --> 04:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
those other things that you mentioned
 
04:10:51.410 --> 04:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
that we want to have food and we want to
 
04:10:54.790 --> 04:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
have food that someone is apt to pick up
 
04:10:58.130 --> 04:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
while they're buying that six-pack
 
04:11:00.349 --> 04:11:00.359 align:start position:0%
so you need to put your thinking cap on
 
04:11:03.830 --> 04:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
go into all these convenience stores and
 
04:11:07.010 --> 04:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
find those foods that you think people
 
04:11:09.830 --> 04:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
want and then
 
04:11:12.769 --> 04:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
he can work on that legislation and
 
04:11:16.870 --> 04:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can solve it through rule
 
04:11:20.090 --> 04:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
rather than a new statute but that we
 
04:11:22.130 --> 04:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
need to know from what representative
 
04:11:24.650 --> 04:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
Terry said to everybody we need to know
 
04:11:26.750 --> 04:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
what is it that they're comfortable
 
04:11:26.760 --> 04:11:28.729 align:start position:0%
what is it that they're comfortable
selling

04:11:28.729 --> 04:11:28.739 align:start position:0%
selling
 
04:11:31.790 --> 04:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
that the consumers actually want and the
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors will be by Lottery they'll
 
04:11:34.969 --> 04:11:34.979 align:start position:0%
be chosen by Lottery because I'm sure
 
04:11:38.090 --> 04:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
there'll be so many okay represented
 
04:11:40.070 --> 04:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr chairman can we
 
04:11:42.110 --> 04:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
still get an explanation of exactly what
 
04:11:44.090 --> 04:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
the three thousand dollars consists of
 
04:11:46.550 --> 04:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
stuff get that get I want I want to know
 
04:11:48.889 --> 04:11:48.899 align:start position:0%
what that three can you send send us
 
04:11:51.410 --> 04:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
that list yeah just that's that is that
 
04:11:54.170 --> 04:11:54.180 align:start position:0%
by that's by rule now correct so it's
 
04:11:56.150 --> 04:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
rule anyway so we're changing and if you
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
could give us some examples of what
 
04:11:59.809 --> 04:11:59.819 align:start position:0%
would not be included currently
 
04:12:01.729 --> 04:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
so you know I mean I'm just going to be
 
04:12:05.150 --> 04:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
ridiculous here but let's just say uh uh
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh a bag of peanuts shell you know a
 
04:12:11.090 --> 04:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
whole shelled peanuts which the people
 
04:12:12.410 --> 04:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
who typically Munch with beer or
 
04:12:14.929 --> 04:12:14.939 align:start position:0%
whatever but if for some reason shell a
 
04:12:16.849 --> 04:12:16.859 align:start position:0%
bag of shelled peanuts are not on the
 
04:12:19.429 --> 04:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
list you know we we need to know is what
 
04:12:21.290 --> 04:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
you have in mind as unacceptable
 
04:12:23.330 --> 04:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
currently as well as what's acceptable
 
04:12:26.090 --> 04:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you vegetarians like the peanuts
 
04:12:26.100 --> 04:12:27.610 align:start position:0%
thank you vegetarians like the peanuts
so

04:12:27.610 --> 04:12:27.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:30.290 --> 04:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
Mr Chicken can you answer this yes yes
 
04:12:32.269 --> 04:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative I was going to say when I
 
04:12:32.279 --> 04:12:33.309 align:start position:0%
representative I was going to say when I
first

04:12:33.309 --> 04:12:33.319 align:start position:0%
first
 
04:12:35.990 --> 04:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
deferred that uh it might be something
 
04:12:37.969 --> 04:12:37.979 align:start position:0%
we could defer just let the Liquor
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
Commission come up with changes and the
 
04:12:42.889 --> 04:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
reason is I'll read it's a one sentence
 
04:12:45.530 --> 04:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
uh requirement it says under definition
 
04:12:47.870 --> 04:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
of grocery or convenience store
 
04:12:50.450 --> 04:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
such establishments shall have and
 
04:12:52.130 --> 04:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
maintain groceries which are readily
 
04:12:53.630 --> 04:12:53.640 align:start position:0%
available to the public the wholesale
 
04:12:55.610 --> 04:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
value of which shall not be less than
 
04:12:57.410 --> 04:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars exclusive of
 
04:12:59.450 --> 04:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
cigarettes magazines newspapers wine and
 
04:13:02.150 --> 04:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
beverages such groceries shall be
 
04:13:04.370 --> 04:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative of grocery items commonly
 
04:13:06.769 --> 04:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
found in such stores so my
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this originally was
 
04:13:10.849 --> 04:13:10.859 align:start position:0%
that they could get three thousand
 
04:13:12.349 --> 04:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
dollars of
 
04:13:14.750 --> 04:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
anything from Market Basket or Hannaford
 
04:13:16.490 --> 04:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
that they could get three thousand of
 
04:13:18.710 --> 04:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
anything and what's what what's happened
 
04:13:20.929 --> 04:13:20.939 align:start position:0%
is that the The Liquor Commission has
 
04:13:22.729 --> 04:13:22.739 align:start position:0%
interpreted this as that they've had to
 
04:13:24.309 --> 04:13:24.319 align:start position:0%
come up with their own set of
 
04:13:27.170 --> 04:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
restrictions only narrowing it down they
 
04:13:29.210 --> 04:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
created a rule around it and that the
 
04:13:32.330 --> 04:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
rule seems offensive to you uh it's it
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
can be too restrictive in other words if
 
04:13:36.110 --> 04:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
you just said if we if we just said
 
04:13:37.189 --> 04:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to follow the legislative
 
04:13:39.170 --> 04:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
intent of the law itself we might not
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
need a change in the law to just say
 
04:13:44.570 --> 04:13:44.580 align:start position:0%
sorry to just say it's representative of
 
04:13:46.130 --> 04:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
anything that's found in a grocery store
 
04:13:47.990 --> 04:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
which is essentially what the the
 
04:13:49.729 --> 04:13:49.739 align:start position:0%
wording of the statute is if we just
 
04:13:51.590 --> 04:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
follow the wording of the statute that
 
04:13:53.210 --> 04:13:53.220 align:start position:0%
would give them three thousand dollars
 
04:13:54.530 --> 04:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
of whatever is in there other than
 
04:13:57.830 --> 04:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
obviously beer wine and tobacco
 
04:14:00.110 --> 04:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
and and Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:14:02.450 --> 04:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative both both of you and all
 
04:14:03.410 --> 04:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
of you
 
04:14:06.530 --> 04:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I I will tell you this uh that was
 
04:14:11.450 --> 04:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
representative of of the law and and I'm
 
04:14:13.729 --> 04:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
sure back in the day when that was
 
04:14:18.769 --> 04:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
written and authored it was agreed upon
 
04:14:21.650 --> 04:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
um I think a majority of you know that
 
04:14:23.929 --> 04:14:23.939 align:start position:0%
in in the six years we have written the
 
04:14:28.849 --> 04:14:28.859 align:start position:0%
1100 500 200s uh 700s and we're in the
 
04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
middle of the 600s right now we have
 
04:14:33.410 --> 04:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
Rewritten all those rules
 
04:14:36.229 --> 04:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
um and with with the best intent of
 
04:14:38.689 --> 04:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
being as close to the current day as
 
04:14:43.250 --> 04:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
possible and not back in 1934. So if
 
04:14:44.750 --> 04:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
this is one that needs to be changed
 
04:14:47.210 --> 04:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
there's no adversarial
 
04:14:49.070 --> 04:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
uh contact here with the Liquor
 
04:14:51.769 --> 04:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
Commission we we want to change let's
 
04:14:53.929 --> 04:14:53.939 align:start position:0%
just talk about how we change it I'm
 
04:14:56.330 --> 04:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
okay with that okay we all are chairman
 
04:14:58.250 --> 04:14:58.260 align:start position:0%
you're going to get rid of canned beans
 
04:15:00.530 --> 04:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
we don't want canned food we want Frozen
 
04:15:03.290 --> 04:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
Foods all right we're healthier for you
 
04:15:04.610 --> 04:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to work with them and I'm
 
04:15:05.630 --> 04:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
willing to work with members of the
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
committee to absolutely so the
 
04:15:08.870 --> 04:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
understanding would be is we're going to
 
04:15:10.670 --> 04:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
say not recommended future legislation
 
04:15:13.429 --> 04:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
not because we don't agree with the
 
04:15:15.469 --> 04:15:15.479 align:start position:0%
underlying concept that the department
 
04:15:19.189 --> 04:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
needs to change its rules on what foods
 
04:15:22.370 --> 04:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
are appropriate for this statute Mr
 
04:15:25.849 --> 04:15:25.859 align:start position:0%
chairman upon re reading the legislation
 
04:15:29.630 --> 04:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
and the clear wording that I believe
 
04:15:31.250 --> 04:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
that I heard from representative
 
04:15:34.010 --> 04:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
Abramson it is it is hypothetically
 
04:15:36.349 --> 04:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
possible that since we're talking about
 
04:15:38.389 --> 04:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
items that are comparable that are
 
04:15:41.210 --> 04:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
comparably sold in a grocery store that
 
04:15:43.010 --> 04:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
that the rule that may come back to us
 
04:15:46.189 --> 04:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
is is actually going to be reflective of
 
04:15:49.910 --> 04:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
that clear here language that provides
 
04:15:52.550 --> 04:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
for a broad range of products rather
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
than to have to provide a laundry list
 
04:15:57.110 --> 04:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
of products or categories because
 
04:16:00.050 --> 04:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more sold today in a
 
04:16:02.689 --> 04:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
Hannaford or Market Basket than back in
 
04:16:04.729 --> 04:16:04.739 align:start position:0%
the 1930s when they didn't even exist
 
04:16:07.550 --> 04:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative yes
 
04:16:08.990 --> 04:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you we're going to make a few
 
04:16:09.000 --> 04:16:10.849 align:start position:0%
thank you we're going to make a few
points

04:16:10.849 --> 04:16:10.859 align:start position:0%
points
 
04:16:11.870 --> 04:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to change the
 
04:16:13.790 --> 04:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
definition of a convenience store if we
 
04:16:15.710 --> 04:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
make some changes here because I just
 
04:16:18.889 --> 04:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
reviewed the definition
 
04:16:21.769 --> 04:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
in regards to prepared foods you're
 
04:16:22.969 --> 04:16:22.979 align:start position:0%
going to get you're going to have to get
 
04:16:24.710 --> 04:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
a license from the health department
 
04:16:26.450 --> 04:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to have a three
 
04:16:28.130 --> 04:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
base sink you're going to have to spend
 
04:16:30.410 --> 04:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of money to include which which
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
may work out it may work out they might
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
want to do it
 
04:16:36.530 --> 04:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
um and the third point
 
04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
if you're a business owner and you want
 
04:16:40.429 --> 04:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
to make money you're going to sell what
 
04:16:43.010 --> 04:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
people want I would think recording I
 
04:16:45.110 --> 04:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
would think so too so if you have spam
 
04:16:46.610 --> 04:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
and you have something else and people
 
04:16:50.090 --> 04:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
aren't buying it then don't sell it sell
 
04:16:52.729 --> 04:16:52.739 align:start position:0%
something people want to buy in your
 
04:16:54.830 --> 04:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
neighborhood I agree and I believe that
 
04:16:57.530 --> 04:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
prop I I would say that most of the you
 
04:16:59.330 --> 04:16:59.340 align:start position:0%
know convenience store owners are going
 
04:17:01.969 --> 04:17:01.979 align:start position:0%
to want to sell what they want to sell
 
04:17:03.769 --> 04:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
um according to the you know the rules
 
04:17:07.130 --> 04:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
uh but don't you know it depends where
 
04:17:08.929 --> 04:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
you are if you're in Manchester if
 
04:17:11.330 --> 04:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
you're on Beach Street or Union you're
 
04:17:13.010 --> 04:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
going to be wanting to sell more food
 
04:17:15.050 --> 04:17:15.060 align:start position:0%
than anything else well and regrettably
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
with every passing day it's going to be
 
04:17:18.349 --> 04:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
easier and easier to reach a three
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:26.570 --> 04:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
so that's my two cents
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
or harder and harder to sell it
 
04:17:29.760 --> 04:17:33.710 align:start position:0%
or harder and harder to sell it
yep

04:17:33.710 --> 04:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:35.750 --> 04:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much and to me it
 
04:17:38.689 --> 04:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem very difficult
 
04:17:40.910 --> 04:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
um to come up with three thousand
 
04:17:44.330 --> 04:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of items that
 
04:17:47.870 --> 04:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
um appeal to the same Market as somebody
 
04:17:50.990 --> 04:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to the convenience store to to buy
 
04:17:53.389 --> 04:17:53.399 align:start position:0%
beer I mean you could do it with 600
 
04:17:55.429 --> 04:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
bags of potato chips
 
04:17:58.610 --> 04:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
um it to me that would wouldn't qualify
 
04:18:00.349 --> 04:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
they couldn't come up with some product
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
line specialized in snack foods it has
 
04:18:05.809 --> 04:18:05.819 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:18:08.090 --> 04:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
how long is the rule can you read us the
 
04:18:08.100 --> 04:18:08.990 align:start position:0%
how long is the rule can you read us the
rule

04:18:08.990 --> 04:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
rule
 
04:18:09.000 --> 04:18:10.790 align:start position:0%
rule
certainly

04:18:10.790 --> 04:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
it's liquor 40402 grocery or convenience
 
04:18:16.790 --> 04:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
stores combination licenses
 
04:18:20.269 --> 04:18:20.279 align:start position:0%
sub paragraph a license licensees
 
04:18:22.870 --> 04:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
licensed at grocery stores under RSA
 
04:18:25.790 --> 04:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
178.18 shall have and maintained readily
 
04:18:27.530 --> 04:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
available to the public representative
 
04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
grocery stock
 
04:18:32.570 --> 04:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
which includes number one bread products
 
04:18:35.630 --> 04:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
number two meat products whether fresh
 
04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
or canned number three dairy products
 
04:18:41.090 --> 04:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
including milk number four cereal
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
products whether hot or cold number five
 
04:18:45.530 --> 04:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
vegetables whether canned or fresh
 
04:18:48.349 --> 04:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
number six fruit whether canned or fresh
 
04:18:51.490 --> 04:18:51.500 align:start position:0%
and number seven snack foods
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
so could you have all of your inventory
 
04:18:56.269 --> 04:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
and snack but you got to have one of you
 
04:18:58.130 --> 04:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
got to have items in every one of those
 
04:19:00.769 --> 04:19:00.779 align:start position:0%
categories that's the that's the catch
 
04:19:03.650 --> 04:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's not just chips so the
 
04:19:05.450 --> 04:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollar Wholesale grocery
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
store stock restriction is not that
 
04:19:10.189 --> 04:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
they're selling three thousand dollars
 
04:19:12.050 --> 04:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
in Wholesale grocery stock they have
 
04:19:15.710 --> 04:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
that they have it at inventory correct
 
04:19:19.490 --> 04:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
but as a representative uh pointed out
 
04:19:22.670 --> 04:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
as you start including more and more
 
04:19:26.689 --> 04:19:26.699 align:start position:0%
things such as the prepared foods that
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
now Food Service licenses are going to
 
04:19:29.990 --> 04:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
apply there
 
04:19:32.809 --> 04:19:32.819 align:start position:0%
so whereas we don't require a
 
04:19:35.090 --> 04:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
convenience store to have a food service
 
04:19:37.490 --> 04:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
license right now for the purposes of a
 
04:19:40.010 --> 04:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
liquor license they will have to have
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
this for if they start serving prepared
 
04:19:46.070 --> 04:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
foods and repair foods are part of these
 
04:19:48.050 --> 04:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
restrictions so your interpretation and
 
04:19:50.689 --> 04:19:50.699 align:start position:0%
application of this of this rule is such
 
04:19:52.670 --> 04:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
that you must have at least one item in
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
each of those categories Cream of Wheat
 
04:19:56.750 --> 04:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
right you can't just those items have to
 
04:19:58.610 --> 04:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
be representative of the three thousand
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
dollar wholesale group so you'd have to
 
04:20:01.849 --> 04:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
have one dairy product to meet the
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
minimum for dairy products that's
 
04:20:05.689 --> 04:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
correct right you you so you're forced
 
04:20:07.550 --> 04:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
to have at least one item in each of
 
04:20:08.809 --> 04:20:08.819 align:start position:0%
those categories in order to be
 
04:20:11.809 --> 04:20:11.819 align:start position:0%
considered a convenience store for the
 
04:20:15.530 --> 04:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
purposes of being able to sell
 
04:20:15.540 --> 04:20:16.849 align:start position:0%
purposes of being able to sell
liquor

04:20:16.849 --> 04:20:16.859 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
that that's correct okay
 
04:20:21.410 --> 04:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
so obviously we'd love to have this
 
04:20:25.550 --> 04:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
solved by rule
 
04:20:28.429 --> 04:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
yes um and and
 
04:20:31.969 --> 04:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
but then the the devil's in the details
 
04:20:34.670 --> 04:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
with a was represented below points out
 
04:20:36.889 --> 04:20:36.899 align:start position:0%
that when you get into prepared products
 
04:20:39.490 --> 04:20:39.500 align:start position:0%
now you've opened up a new can of worms
 
04:20:43.010 --> 04:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
because you're going to have to have the
 
04:20:44.889 --> 04:20:44.899 align:start position:0%
food you got to have a license to have
 
04:20:46.969 --> 04:20:46.979 align:start position:0%
prepared foods which means you have to
 
04:20:50.030 --> 04:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
have a industrial kitchen with that
 
04:20:51.950 --> 04:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
special water treatment you know the
 
04:20:54.830 --> 04:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
sewer system and all that nine that we
 
04:20:56.450 --> 04:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
learned already when it came back to
 
04:20:57.969 --> 04:20:57.979 align:start position:0%
food trucks
 
04:20:59.990 --> 04:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
so we've already learned all that
 
04:21:02.150 --> 04:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
problem so
 
04:21:02.160 --> 04:21:03.590 align:start position:0%
problem so
so

04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:09.170 --> 04:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
sorry we're quoting on this in two weeks
 
04:21:13.729 --> 04:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
in two weeks so we're we're in terms of
 
04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
whether they get solved the next two
 
04:21:17.570 --> 04:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
weeks the issue is the way your bill was
 
04:21:19.670 --> 04:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
written which was to remove the three
 
04:21:21.290 --> 04:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar requirement altogether
 
04:21:25.429 --> 04:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
is not a good idea we want we want some
 
04:21:28.670 --> 04:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
food requirement
 
04:21:30.889 --> 04:21:30.899 align:start position:0%
I think I mean how do people feel is
 
04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
that yeah we're not going to do it today
 
04:21:34.309 --> 04:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do it today well I'm
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
going to have to talk to other members
 
04:21:36.590 --> 04:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee and I'm going to have
 
04:21:38.510 --> 04:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
to talk to the commissioner but that's
 
04:21:40.969 --> 04:21:40.979 align:start position:0%
that you have our commitment to to
 
04:21:43.610 --> 04:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
knowing so well that you won't be with
 
04:21:46.370 --> 04:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
us you know we will work on getting this
 
04:21:49.550 --> 04:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
issue solved in a way that that we will
 
04:21:52.250 --> 04:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
never see spam again
 
04:21:54.769 --> 04:21:54.779 align:start position:0%
right nice could I just mention
 
04:21:56.510 --> 04:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
something on this very quick
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
I think one thing to note is how that
 
04:22:01.490 --> 04:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
the representation that you're making is
 
04:22:03.229 --> 04:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
not how we suggest that this is applied
 
04:22:05.090 --> 04:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
in the field in the field when we do
 
04:22:06.769 --> 04:22:06.779 align:start position:0%
these inspections and when we approve
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
these convenience stores we've had
 
04:22:10.130 --> 04:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
several convenience stores throughout
 
04:22:11.630 --> 04:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
the state who have said
 
04:22:13.969 --> 04:22:13.979 align:start position:0%
do I have to do the can of spam and the
 
04:22:16.309 --> 04:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
can of corn and we say no bring us what
 
04:22:17.590 --> 04:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
you'd like to do you know we've
 
04:22:20.450 --> 04:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
substituted granola for cereal I mean
 
04:22:22.610 --> 04:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
some of the some of them get so granular
 
04:22:24.650 --> 04:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
in what that what they think that
 
04:22:27.290 --> 04:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
definition is and it's not how we ask
 
04:22:30.670 --> 04:22:30.680 align:start position:0%
them to apply that rule so you will see
 
04:22:33.650 --> 04:22:33.660 align:start position:0%
convenience stores in the state that
 
04:22:36.349 --> 04:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
take it literal that that's a can of
 
04:22:38.870 --> 04:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
spam or a can of meat and we encourage
 
04:22:41.330 --> 04:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
them to I heard the word can one too
 
04:22:45.170 --> 04:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:47.330 --> 04:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
yeah there's just something to note that
 
04:22:49.969 --> 04:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
that is not how we we want them to apply
 
04:22:52.610 --> 04:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
to apply the role we encourage them to
 
04:22:54.710 --> 04:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
give us a business plan right but it but
 
04:22:57.650 --> 04:22:57.660 align:start position:0%
the what bugs me was and I this was true
 
04:22:59.990 --> 04:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
first time I ever heard it was that you
 
04:23:02.330 --> 04:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
had to have some representation in each
 
04:23:03.950 --> 04:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
of those categories
 
04:23:07.130 --> 04:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to a meat product
 
04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's either in my mind it's
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
either Frozen or canned the idea of
 
04:23:17.210 --> 04:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
having fresh meat is now you've got the
 
04:23:20.330 --> 04:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
now you've got the uh the the town's
 
04:23:23.870 --> 04:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
code enforcer all over your back
 
04:23:26.450 --> 04:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
so representative Bartlett I guess my
 
04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
feeling is this is an interim
 
04:23:32.689 --> 04:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
study not a full-blown public hearing to
 
04:23:34.670 --> 04:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
make this bill
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
better better or pass it or any of that
 
04:23:40.130 --> 04:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
I think we're we've put a tremendous
 
04:23:42.110 --> 04:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
amount of time and discussion that
 
04:23:43.969 --> 04:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
really belongs in full public hearings
 
04:23:46.610 --> 04:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
and I just don't think you know that
 
04:23:50.150 --> 04:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
this this amount of going down this
 
04:23:53.990 --> 04:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole is is worthwhile okay fair
 
04:23:54.000 --> 04:23:55.130 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole is is worthwhile okay fair
enough

04:23:55.130 --> 04:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
enough
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
all right we all said
 
04:24:01.610 --> 04:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
okay so who's bringing in the motion
 
04:24:01.620 --> 04:24:03.950 align:start position:0%
okay so who's bringing in the motion
okay

04:24:03.950 --> 04:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:24:03.960 --> 04:24:07.550 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

04:24:07.550 --> 04:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:10.610 --> 04:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
so the question was it's the language
 
04:24:12.590 --> 04:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
and the bill is not recommended but that
 
04:24:16.130 --> 04:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
the committee feels legislation that the
 
04:24:19.429 --> 04:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
department needs to change its rules
 
04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
to be more up to date with what is going
 
04:24:25.130 --> 04:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
on in convenience stores I'm sure that
 
04:24:28.490 --> 04:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh the secretary will note that in the
 
04:24:30.530 --> 04:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
notes of the meeting and that will be
 
04:24:32.450 --> 04:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
preserved and we'll honor that as we can
 
04:24:33.950 --> 04:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
go forward are you willing to make that
 
04:24:36.110 --> 04:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
motion then what am I making the most
 
04:24:38.750 --> 04:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
not recommended as as written not
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
recommended is written but that the
 
04:24:45.110 --> 04:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
department will revise its rules
 
04:24:48.710 --> 04:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
to bring it up to uh items that well I
 
04:24:51.530 --> 04:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
would say but but we we acknowledge that
 
04:24:52.630 --> 04:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
the department
 
04:24:56.750 --> 04:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh has indicated that they will work on
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
revising the rule to reflect our
 
04:25:01.790 --> 04:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
concerns correct yes everybody okay with
 
04:25:04.689 --> 04:25:04.699 align:start position:0%
that that's fine yes
 
04:25:04.699 --> 04:25:06.229 align:start position:0%
that that's fine yes
yes

04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:25:08.090 --> 04:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
and that'll go
 
04:25:09.950 --> 04:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
that goes in the blurb there's actually
 
04:25:11.809 --> 04:25:11.819 align:start position:0%
a blurb when you make these motions all
 
04:25:11.819 --> 04:25:13.130 align:start position:0%
a blurb when you make these motions all
right

04:25:13.130 --> 04:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:25:13.140 --> 04:25:14.450 align:start position:0%
right
okay

04:25:14.450 --> 04:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:25:16.870 --> 04:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
all right well remind me of them
 
04:25:18.950 --> 04:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
write a minority just so there's a
 
04:25:20.570 --> 04:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
minority no you want to write that
 
04:25:23.630 --> 04:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
majority report I mean no I I you can't
 
04:25:25.550 --> 04:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
the way your wording which was you want
 
04:25:27.590 --> 04:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
to remove the dollar amount I want to
 
04:25:30.349 --> 04:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
remove your bill removed the dollar this
 
04:25:32.090 --> 04:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
is what I'm saying I want to remove that
 
04:25:35.330 --> 04:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
sentence because it's a mandate that the
 
04:25:38.630 --> 04:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
public perceives as a stupid rule okay
 
04:25:40.550 --> 04:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
just so you know there are no minority
 
04:25:42.590 --> 04:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
reports okay okay
 
04:25:45.889 --> 04:25:45.899 align:start position:0%
moving on last but not least
 
04:25:45.899 --> 04:25:47.689 align:start position:0%
moving on last but not least
okay

04:25:47.689 --> 04:25:47.699 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
um eliminating the enforcement division
 
04:25:51.649 --> 04:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
of the Liquor Commission is this
 
04:25:54.349 --> 04:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
actually debatable I mean do we actually
 
04:25:55.790 --> 04:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
have to have a discussion on this or
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
there's other people is there anybody in
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
the room think this is a good idea is
 
04:26:01.849 --> 04:26:01.859 align:start position:0%
anybody in the room think this is a good
 
04:26:01.859 --> 04:26:03.849 align:start position:0%
anybody in the room think this is a good
idea

04:26:03.849 --> 04:26:03.859 align:start position:0%
idea
 
04:26:06.530 --> 04:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
my recollection of the public hearings
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
there were some members of the finance
 
04:26:11.149 --> 04:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
committee that came to testify but after
 
04:26:12.710 --> 04:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
the hearing was over I saw all of you
 
04:26:14.210 --> 04:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
shaking hands and being very friendly
 
04:26:16.490 --> 04:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
with one another so I think the issue
 
04:26:18.170 --> 04:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
got worked out and it has to do with
 
04:26:20.809 --> 04:26:20.819 align:start position:0%
reports being available and made public
 
04:26:24.229 --> 04:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
so so my recommendation would be uh not
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation uh I
 
04:26:29.269 --> 04:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
can leave it at that all in favor thank
 
04:26:32.889 --> 04:26:32.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:35.870 --> 04:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's anybody
 
04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
I think we took care of it okay yeah
 
04:26:39.889 --> 04:26:39.899 align:start position:0%
representative is going to make the
 
04:26:43.210 --> 04:26:43.220 align:start position:0%
motion I'd like to move forward okay HB
 
04:26:49.010 --> 04:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
1591 I move that there is no future in
 
04:26:51.530 --> 04:26:51.540 align:start position:0%
doing anything about eliminating the
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement division of a Liquor
 
04:26:52.920 --> 04:26:53.990 align:start position:0%
enforcement division of a Liquor
Commission

04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
04:26:55.969 --> 04:26:55.979 align:start position:0%
for mainly two reasons
 
04:26:59.630 --> 04:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
one the enforcement division also
 
04:27:04.490 --> 04:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
engages in education which has become a
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
very hot primary topic with our use of
 
04:27:07.680 --> 04:27:08.510 align:start position:0%
very hot primary topic with our use of
today

04:27:08.510 --> 04:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:27:10.189 --> 04:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
and I think they're doing an excellent
 
04:27:13.910 --> 04:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
job on doing it and getting rid of it
 
04:27:16.010 --> 04:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
and changing it to just an education
 
04:27:20.809 --> 04:27:20.819 align:start position:0%
division would limit their activities uh
 
04:27:22.250 --> 04:27:22.260 align:start position:0%
in the especially in the enforcement
 
04:27:25.010 --> 04:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
side which is also quite active now with
 
04:27:27.769 --> 04:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
the uh the drug and alcohol problem that
 
04:27:29.450 --> 04:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
we've had we're having this state and
 
04:27:31.910 --> 04:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
with illegal drugs especially and that
 
04:27:35.090 --> 04:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:40.849 --> 04:27:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:42.590 --> 04:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
