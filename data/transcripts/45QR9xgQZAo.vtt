the most recent incident involving a

a somber reminder of the ongoing danger
 
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
presented by this intersection

historical data paints a grim picture
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
with over 133 accidents occurring in the
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
last 6 years alone including the

heartbreaking loss of of Dorothy
 
00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
Charlene buek uh back in November of
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
2016 outside the window of those
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
accidents now these are not mere
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
statistics they represent families
 
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
people's lives and the community that is
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
mourned uh including the surrounding
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
properties to the intersection and that
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
really just underscores the pressing
 
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
need for for action on this intersection
 
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 align:start position:0%
that we have the town of Salem has been
 
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
in talks with the state since the 2016
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
accident about ways to improve this
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
intersection and those talks are still
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
ongoing and really just trying to get
 
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
direction on this and and get it in
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
moving into the pipeline to to get a
 
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400 align:start position:0%
signalized intersection there the design
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
currently of the intersection and I I
 
00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
sent out a map to all of you uh the two
 
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
intersecting roads to Route 111 uh
 
00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
connect to the intersection at a 45
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
degree angle uh those roads have miles
 
00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
per hours of about 30 mil per hour
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
limits and then the route 111 at that
 
00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
point is a 50 mph Zone uh you'll
 
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
typically see drivers driving 60 65 m
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
with the speed the flow of traffic it is
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
a it's a it's a heavily trafficked Road
 
00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:36.879 align:start position:0%
in between Exit 3 and the towns of dairy
 
00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
Salem uh Windam and uh in Hamstead uh
 
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
there's numerous large businesses along
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
the road that gets Trucking in the
 
00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:46.759 align:start position:0%
morning in the afternoon times uh for
 
00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:48.759 align:start position:0%
high traffic waves and it's it's a main
 
00:07:50.869 --> 00:07:50.879 align:start position:0%
artery uh in our town and and and
 
00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:52.919 align:start position:0%
frankly the the statistics that can be
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
provided um in the analysis of by dot
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
will show a picture of it not being this
 
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
intersection not being utilized as much
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
as other signalized intersections in
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
town and that's because people are
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
avoiding this intersection going out of
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
their way driving on back roads in Salem
 
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
and Derry and Hamstead to avoid the
 
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
intersection at Irma Road and Route 111
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
to avoid any potential tragic uh
 
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
captions I'll finish with that the cost
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
of inaction is just too high measured in
 
00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
human lives you know one death is too
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
many we've had two in the last eight
 
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
years and we'll have numerous more uh if
 
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
we don't take action here and anything
 
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
that we can do to stop uh the tragedies
 
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
and the accidents and the deaths of this
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
intersection uh the the town of Salem is
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
willing to work with the state to get
 
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
this done uh and we just want to get
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%

spot representative are there any
 
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
emminent domain concerns that are being
 
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
raised as a consequence of The Proposal
 
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
no there there's no so to put a
 
00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959 align:start position:0%
signalized inter section there's no
 
00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
eminent domain concerns uh for the area
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
there's the within the RightWay we'd
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do so there's been
 
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
another proposal floating around that do
 
00:09:40.509 --> 00:09:40.519 align:start position:0%
came to a town council meeting with to
 
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
put a rotary in the intersection that
 
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
the town does not want um and that would
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
require eminent domain and a lengthier
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
process to to fix the intersection and
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
frankly I think inadequately so uh with
 
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
a rotary at that at that point that
 
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
juncture um so that's why we support a
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
lit signalized intersection that's in
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
the smart grid as we're updating all of
 
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.160 align:start position:0%
our intersections currently so that
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
they're timed properly with the other
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
intersections feeding into it and then
 
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
one question one last final up Mr
 
00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for the latitude I
 
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
you answered my question but I just want
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
to amplify the point so there have been
 
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
conversations between dot in the town of
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
Salem work regarding traffic caling uh
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
techniques that could be utilized 111
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
specifically either rumble strips or a
 
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
rotary rotary obviously you told me the
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
rotary was exploded and extinguished so
 
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
I'll push the rumble strips and ask that
 
00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
question yep absolutely and and just to
 
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
further this I filed this bill I believe
 
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
it was in October or November whenever
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
we had to file the Bill Dot came to the
 
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
Salem Town Council in December with
 
00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
their list of possible fixes to to
 
00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
mitigate the causes uh they calculate
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
that uh rotary there which I still feel
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
is unacceptable uh could save up to
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
three lives a year whereas a lit
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
intersection would only save 1.3 lives a
 
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
year uh seeing as we've lost two lives
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
over eight years a lit intersection
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
would still serve the needs of what
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
we're looking to do here uh without
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
having to go into eminent domain and and
 
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
being a full process to redesign the
 
00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
whole Road okay thank you thank you Mr
 
00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:10.839 align:start position:0%
chairman um further questions yes
 
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
representative Abbott
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
please yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question was
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
this intersection and the traffic light
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
there brought up in any GA any gaset
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
hearing or part of the 10-year plan I I
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
believe it has been in the past and I've
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
talked to the executive Council about
 
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
this as well U but I can't speak
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
specifically to recent conversations on
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
it but I know the town of Salem has been
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
talking with do since 2016 on this
 
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
intersection thank you thank you any
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
further questions representative yes
 
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
please J thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative has there been a traffic
 
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
study have just flipping through the
 
00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
bill has there been a traffic study
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
performed there there has been and I was
 
00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:00.519 align:start position:0%
I I was expecting do to be here and I'm
 
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
not sure if they are um they did a
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
traffic study we we actually most
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
recently did a traffic study that ended
 
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh the day before the most recent tragic
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
accident um at the intersection and
 
00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
that's where they got the numbers from
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
three lives saved a year with a rotary
 
00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:17.320 align:start position:0%
versus 1.2 Liv saved a year with a
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
signalized intersection um obviously I I
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
think we can look at studies every day
 
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
and find a different stud to back up
 
00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
anything um I just see there's a need to
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
save one life a year and a lit
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
intersection would do that Qui than you
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
followup question and speed limits have
 
00:12:39.629 --> 00:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
been explored in that on both 111 and
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
Elma Road absolutely and and we are the
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
town is open to working with the state
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
on speed limits in the road design and
 
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
and there's a number of options for them
 
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
just as a as a be as a bare minimum the
 
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
town and the people the community and
 
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
the surrounding property owners and the
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
residents there want to see a signalized
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
intersection at this intersection and
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
we're open to having conversations about
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
raise medians speed limits the whole
 
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
nine yards to to fix this intersection
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
and make it safer thank you thank you Mr
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you yes please represent
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
fauler so I'm trying to understand that
 
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
the reason why you
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
prefer signalize
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
intersection over rotary roundabout what
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
we call them these days is the cost or
 
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
the time to implement it I mean if
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
do thinks that roundabout is a better
 
00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:36.519 align:start position:0%
solution um it doesn't look from this
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
Photograph like there's much development
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
around there not really displacing
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
businesses is it is it the idea of using
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
people's of having to buy people's land
 
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
it's the problem what is what are the
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
major ders of this absolutely thank you
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
for the question there will be um more
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
development on the north side of Route
 
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
11s that's not seen in the the map right
 
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
now but there's already been approval
 
00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:01.959 align:start position:0%
for for development there I think in
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
general and talking on behalf of my
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
constituents uh we've had roundabouts
 
00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:09.759 align:start position:0%
put in other places within town uh the
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
the usability of the roundabouts and the
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
feasibility especially when we have a 50
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
mile per hour road with 230 and 25 M per
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
hour roads and that they the issue is
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
when people are trying to get off of the
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
side streets onto the main road um and I
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
just don't see a in reality I don't see
 
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
a roundabout aiding that that
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
process followup
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
represent um state has a lot of
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
experience with roundabouts in my corner
 
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
of the state Southwestern corner of the
 
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.790 align:start position:0%
of the state Southwestern corner of the
state

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you any further questions
 
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.470 align:start position:0%
so thank you any further questions
representative

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
Sweeny yes please thank you represent
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
Melvin could you tell
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
me how far away the next stoplight is
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
yep there's a there's another stop light
 
00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
I believe within a mile and a half um in
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
both Direction directions of this
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
intersection um those are those are all
 
00:15:04.509 --> 00:15:04.519 align:start position:0%
lit so you're going in from two lit
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
intersections to an unsignalized
 
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
intersection and that's where you have
 
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
people are just they just drive fast in
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
between the two lights thank you yes
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
please represent Newman yes thank you so
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
just to be clear on on this map here
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
it's the people coming from Irma Road
 
00:15:29.069 --> 00:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
trying to get out on 111 going in either
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
direction and for Speed and everything
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
else of the traveling on 111 things are
 
00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
happening yes yes it is and Irma Road
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
has a residential neighborhood right
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
behind the businesses so there there's
 
00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
approximately 1500 residents that live
 
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
off of this or off of Irma Road in
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
various neighborhoods that need to
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
utilize this intersection to get on or
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
off 111 um and it's when they're pulling
 
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
uh either to the left or to the right
 
00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
where they're getting into the flow of
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
traffic and that's where for the
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
accident start are caused thank you
 
00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
further questions represent
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
bogert uh thank you Mr chairman you had
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's a development on the
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh one of the corners that have been
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
approved and stuff would impact fees be
 
00:16:20.309 --> 00:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
used and helping to signalize that
 
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
because that's actually going to
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
increase the traffic trips for that
 
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
intersection I believe that's how we
 
00:16:27.949 --> 00:16:27.959 align:start position:0%
would use the the especially the public
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
safety impact fees um and there's going
 
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
to be more development in Salem and in
 
00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire the Windam dairy
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
Salem line there's a lot of development
 
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
that's going on uh we had when we had
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
the presentation in town they put up a
 
00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
photo of Route 111 and it probably
 
00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:45.079 align:start position:0%
looked it looks a lot like a photo of
 
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
Route 28 40 years ago in Salem which is
 
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
now the commercial core of the town uh
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
we expect outside of the wetlands that
 
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
are near this property uh near this
 
00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
intersection that it's all going to be
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
built out within the next 20 years uh we
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
want to get ahead of the build
 
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
out thank you any yes please represent
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
kazinski thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um in your
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
research with the tragedies that have
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
happened here is it Road design or human
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
error that's caused these
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
accidents I I truly think it's the road
 
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
design uh part of the issue is is that
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
irmer road is is really at a slanted 45
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
degree angle to Route 111 and so if
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
you're at Irma Road and you're trying to
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
turn turn left onto Route 111 to go
 
00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
towards Exit 3 uh you have to you almost
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
have to do a 160 uh degree turn and if
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
you're in the blind spot or you don't
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
see and you're pulling out there I think
 
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
that's when the the motorcyclist was
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
pulling out of Irma Road trying to go
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
West on 111 and that's when the car hit
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
them going through it um and and it's
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's you know depending on the time of
 
00:17:56.149 --> 00:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
day um if the Sun is in your eyes it's
 
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
tough to tough to see that motorcycle
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
coming in um and that I mean
 
00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
that if there was a silver bullet to
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
prevent traffic tragedies I know your
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
committee would support it 100% there's
 
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
no Silver Bullet if we could develop one
 
00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
that would save all the lives and stop
 
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
all the accidents we would pursue that
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
um and I would support that um but this
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
is just a a a a response to tragedies
 
00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
that have taken place um and I think we
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
we're open to talking about the angle of
 
00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
the road and in the general design of it
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
as well um in order to fix it to make it
 
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
safer for for people that are commuting
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
and driving on the roads thank you re um
 
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
questions uh represent Sweeney I wanted
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
to apologize for being a little tardy
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
here I want to welcome you to public
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
works thank you Mr chairman we don't
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
have you all that often um but I just
 
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
want you to help me understand this so
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
you've been having conversations with uh
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
and I'll get to my questions as I go
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
you've been having a conversation with
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
do about this intersection since
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
2016 um
 
00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:10.039 align:start position:0%
do looked at this intersection probably
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
with participation of of your town and
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
they came to a
 
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
conclusion that the roundabout was the
 
00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:20.679 align:start position:0%
right option for this is that correct
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
that yes that's what they presented to
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
us in December of 2023 okay December of
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
2023 the town the town unfortunately has
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
had tragedy there death so forth I
 
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:36.919 align:start position:0%
understand the passion of this the and
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
then when this 10-year plan came out uh
 
00:19:42.909 --> 00:19:42.919 align:start position:0%
there was conversations during the gaset
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
hearings at one of the other
 
00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh had
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh but am I correct that um
 
00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
your signalized intersection is not
 
00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the 10year plan as is a
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
okay that is all I have for you sir
 
00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:08.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate your time
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank thank you all for for hearing me
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
out and and taking this bill under
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
consideration and good luck with the
 
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
rest of the day thank
 
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
you uh next um I would hear from um well
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
my next one is Ben Frost please um New
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing next bill you're on
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
the next bill okay okay is there anyone
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
is anyone here for do on this one yes
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
yes do okay
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
1262 yes okay I apologize please bill
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
Transportation good morning Mr chairman
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh my name is
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
Bill oldenberg I'm the director of
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
project development um for the
 
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation um
 
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
and I checked off opposed um on this
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
bill um we're not opposed to the project
 
00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to the process so um there
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
is a project in the 10-year plan uh for
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
this intersection it's currently under
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
under design um and by predetermining
 
00:21:23.549 --> 00:21:23.559 align:start position:0%
that a signal um is to be installed sort
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
of predetermines and circumvents the
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
whole uh process from from a public
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
input process from a permitting process
 
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
uh from a 10year plan process so um the
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
project in the 10e plan is Salem
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
43790 um it's currently under uh
 
00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
design uh by a consultant uh
 
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
VHB um and it is a municipally managed
 
00:21:55.149 --> 00:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
project which the town of Salem is
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
managing um so they are are currently
 
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
going through an Alternatives analysis
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
one of the Alternatives is a
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
signalization of the
 
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
intersection um the project is funded
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
through highway safety Improvement uh
 
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
program and currently in the schedule is
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh planned for construction um in March
 
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.590 align:start position:0%
uh planned for construction um in March
of

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:23.559 align:start position:0%
2025 um the issue really for us is um
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
the predetermination that a signal is is
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
to be installed so we go through an
 
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
Alternatives analysis of what are the
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
POS possible options I mean that's
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
required for permitting for you know
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
Federal permitting State permitting um
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know to determine that we we just
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
don't say we're going to install this um
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
so that's part of our our our our review
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
our design um and the the process that
 
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.470 align:start position:0%
our design um and the the process that
we

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.269 align:start position:0%
we
follow

00:22:56.269 --> 00:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
the issue I think and why a roundabout
 
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
was um was sort of highlighted as the
 
00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.710 align:start position:0%
was um was sort of highlighted as the
solution

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
is the the
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
intersection and it's been the
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
reoccurring issue we have in previous
 
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:15.400 align:start position:0%
conversations the intersection doesn't
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
warrant a traffic signal as you know
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
through the design standards the mutcd
 
00:23:23.549 --> 00:23:23.559 align:start position:0%
there are certain requirements for the
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
installation of a signal because a
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
signal installation unto itself creates
 
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.669 align:start position:0%
signal installation unto itself creates
a

00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:33.559 align:start position:0%
hazard so um there will be crashes
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
there'll be different crashes by
 
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
installing the signal so what we're
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
trying to do is make sure that the the
 
00:23:41.789 --> 00:23:41.799 align:start position:0%
installation of the signal is is
 
00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
warranted and I think that is one of the
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
issues as as was testified there are
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
alternative locations that people can go
 
00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
down Armor Road to North Main Street and
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
on the other side there's connecting
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
roads to um the ha Road signal Iz
 
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
intersection just down the road and then
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
the Zachary Crossing intersection both
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
signalized so traffic does that today
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
and I I think you heard that testimony
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
traffic goes to those signalized
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
intersections to avoid this and I think
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
that traffic
 
00:24:18.669 --> 00:24:18.679 align:start position:0%
volume is is the because the traffic
 
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
volume is in there it doesn't warrant a
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
a traffic
 
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
signal putting up a traffic signal um
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
when it's not warranted
 
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
frankly opens you up to
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
liability um uh you know if if you you
 
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
you put it in and and know and there's
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
crashes that occur and it was caused
 
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
signal you know somebody rear ends the
 
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
the the the queue somebody runs a red
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
light and there's crashes the first
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
thing that they're going to do is look
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
to see if if the you know any good
 
00:24:56.669 --> 00:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
lawyer is going to look to see if
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
there's a a signal warrant analysis done
 
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't S meet signal warrant
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
analysis um you know the the state would
 
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
be liable um so I I think that's some of
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
our concern um the the other concern is
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
is more technical um the effective date
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
being 30 60 days after passage um we're
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
assuming that that's when the design
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
would start um and not the installation
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
because um as as we put in the fiscal
 
00:25:28.389 --> 00:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
note uh if we put in a traffic signal
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
the road needs to be widened it's one
 
00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
lane in each direction to store the
 
00:25:35.549 --> 00:25:35.559 align:start position:0%
traffic at the red light um the design
 
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
designers right now are calling for two
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
lanes in each Direction just to store
 
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
the traffic at the red light like you
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
see typically that will require a
 
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.389 align:start position:0%
see typically that will require a
RightWay

00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
RightWay
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
acquisition um so we would have to
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
acquire property um uh from the abuts to
 
00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
be able to do that that's a lengthy
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
process so um if we started now um we're
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
probably talking
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
2026 until we would have a project to
 
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:06.039 align:start position:0%
design like I said the current project
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
is in 2025 so
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
um we don't see a
 
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
a you know a an advantage to creating a
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
new project and also the the other thing
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
is there's no funding associated with
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
this project so
 
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
um it's already in the 10-year plan so
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
there's funding ass associated with the
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
existing project this project there's no
 
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
no funding um we assumed that it would
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
be state funded and in the fiscal note
 
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
we note that there we don't have the you
 
00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919 align:start position:0%
know basically the $2 million to
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
spend in in betterment funds and State
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh Capital funds uh to do this so that
 
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
that's another issue so I will and that
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions represent
 
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
pner can you explain what how what the
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
volume is on irmer road um and do you
 
00:27:05.149 --> 00:27:05.159 align:start position:0%
have information what percentage left
 
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
turns versus right turns versus through
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
uh I do not I'm thinking that the safest
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
intersection here would be to prohibit
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
left turns and create the appropriate
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
islands that that is one of the options
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
to put a raised Island across the
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
intersection and make both sides right
 
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
in right out
 
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
only but thanks thank you rushar
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
you indicated that this project is in
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan is that a project that
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
incorporates a
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
rotary nope it so all of our projects
 
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
come in sort of benign it's a safety
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
Improvement project so it will it it
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
includes all options so the consultant
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
would would look at any safety
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
Improvement um that you could do it in
 
00:27:54.669 --> 00:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
intersection signal
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
roundabout um restricting turns um all
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
all those type of options are on on
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
board so we would look at those um you
 
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:06.039 align:start position:0%
know the the statistics that were shown
 
00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:08.519 align:start position:0%
is we we would do a a benefit cost
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
analysis you know with these certain
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
installations we can we have historical
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
information that say you know if you
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
install this you're going to see this
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
type of safety Improvement you know the
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
the number of lives saved you know that
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
type of information so we do that
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
typically on all our projects that you
 
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:28.630 align:start position:0%
typically on all our projects that you
follow

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.350 align:start position:0%
follow
up

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
so since this there's several options on
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
the table in the 10-year plan and one of
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
them would be a lighted intersection at
 
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
that point if it's chosen to be a
 
00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.789 align:start position:0%
that point if it's chosen to be a
lighted

00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:41.799 align:start position:0%
lighted
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
intersection then would that relieve the
 
00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
state of the
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility because it would now
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
become warranted as you indicated
 
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
earlier it wasn't warranted would that
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
make it warranted and okay to build a
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
light no the the warrants are are
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
basically traffic volume created so you
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
have to have you know so many so many
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
left turns or right turns um versus the
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
through traffic so it it deals with the
 
00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:14.519 align:start position:0%
people's inability to get out uh and and
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
onto the main road onto Route 11 in a
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
timely manner so those are all the
 
00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
warrants that are based they're based on
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
peak hour they're based on you know
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
morning and evening commuting hours um
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
based on you know a bunch of various
 
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:32.149 align:start position:0%
based on you know a bunch of various
different

00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
scenarios so thank you repr Jack uh
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
appearing um you you indicated one of
 
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
the Alternatives that would be analyzed
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
is signalized intersection I'm confused
 
00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
about if we know that the signal
 
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
warrants aren't satisfied is that as
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
simple as oh the signal warrants aren't
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
satisfied that alternative is ruled
 
00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
out typically yes because um if they're
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
not warranted
 
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
we would be very hesitant to installing
 
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
them because of the liability
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
issue thank you rip
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
boy thank you Mr chairman director
 
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
oldenberg thank you for for testifying
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
today um representative Sweeny testified
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
that the town of Salem is willing to
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
take on the signalization at this
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
intersection which would consequently
 
00:30:22.509 --> 00:30:22.519 align:start position:0%
infers to me that they're willing to
 
00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:24.519 align:start position:0%
accept the liability that that is
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
involved as it relates to whether they
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
choose to have a s signal warrant
 
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
analysis or not so is it is it my
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
inference that P excuse me the dot wants
 
00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
if the light were to be put in there
 
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
that you want to retain ownership of
 
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
that we would typically I I believe we
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
would we own or maintain all of the
 
00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:46.039 align:start position:0%
signals on
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
111 um so that's that's the first I've
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
heard the town's willing to take over
 
00:30:55.389 --> 00:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
the ownership I I don't believe we would
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
be opposed to that um but I that that
 
00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
enters into a Nuance
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
that you know I'm I'm not familiar with
 
00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
and I think we would have to talk to the
 
00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:10.360 align:start position:0%
town of Salem so that they they fully
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
understand um the responsibility and the
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
liability they'd be taking over followup
 
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
and then the followup I'm trying to
 
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
understand seven years from a
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
significant accident in 2016 to here we
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
are in 2024
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
and we're we're still discussing about
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
an improvement that both at least again
 
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
how I'm inferring the testimony from
 
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
yourself and from from my colleague
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
behind you that is for the lack of a
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
better word Frau with Peril so I'm
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
trying to understand how a process can
 
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
take seven years a collaborative process
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
between Dot and the town of s take seven
 
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
years to try and mitigate a a nuisance
 
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
intersection that creates certain
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
nightmares for for people trying to
 
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
negotiate that intersection can you
 
00:32:04.269 --> 00:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
explain how dot Works processes as it
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
mitigation that's a
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
very very complicated but what I mean we
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
have numerous
 
00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
intersections with the same type of you
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
know crash history throughout the state
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
um we typically review them uh in the
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
past it was a the state traffic Eng
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
engineer um that would uh receive the
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
the you know receive the complaint uh
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
have the issue raised uh they would
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
typically go through and do a a signal
 
00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
warrant analysis uh
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
because you know back at those in those
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
days and you know even seven years ago
 
00:32:55.389 --> 00:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
um a a project like that would be run
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
through the traffic Bureau so they would
 
00:33:00.389 --> 00:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
would review it they would um they would
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
do an analysis and and see whether meta
 
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
a signal warrant um a
 
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
project that came through um the 10-year
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
plan would have to come through the
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
regional planning commissions um and and
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
and that way um so that then it falls
 
00:33:20.909 --> 00:33:20.919 align:start position:0%
into a priority a regional priority um
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
this project didn't meet that
 
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
requirement so it never came in the 10e
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
plan through our typical you know
 
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
Regional Planning Commission this came
 
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
through as a Safety project working
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
through our our safety section um more
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
or less a a road safety audit um review
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
um which was done I I don't have the
 
00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
date but I'm assuming since this project
 
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
was funded and started several years ago
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
um that um it it it came in you know
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
probably three or four years ago into
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
the process it then gets added Ed into
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
our safety projects funded through hsip
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
that is a much faster uh process but um
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
not all projects uh do that um and it's
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's basically because
 
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
the um the intersection safety is is as
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
you've heard um not stellar and that
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
sort of popped it to the top of the list
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
from a highway safety um Improvement
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
section so that that's how it became a
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
project um and how it was
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
funded okay thank you short followup am
 
00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
I allowed to make a comment or no I
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
would rather you don't I'll hold it hold
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
it for executive session I'll hold it
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
for executive session thank you okay and
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
I I just want to comment in um in my 20
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
years sitting in this room um I have
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
seen very many many projects of this
 
00:34:59.950 --> 00:34:59.960 align:start position:0%
same um importance unfortunately taking
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
this long to make its way up to the top
 
00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
uh re Sam
 
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
Newton thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question is there is
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
there open communication between your
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
department in the town of uh Salem with
 
00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
us I mean are you guys really trying to
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
work together to let them know why this
 
00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:22.119 align:start position:0%
is taking as long as it is and is there
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
any easy uh temporary fix to this
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.829 align:start position:0%
any easy uh temporary fix to this
problem

00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'll start with the communication so I'm
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a little taken back um because I
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
mean this is in the 10-year plan we have
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
an agreement with the town of Salem
 
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
they' they'
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
hired uh VHB one of our best safety
 
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
Consultants to do this work that the
 
00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
information we have came from them and
 
00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
the work that they're doing um working
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
with the town of Salem so I'm I'm I'm
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
not sure why there's a there's a
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
communication disruption but um this is
 
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
not this is a do funded project that is
 
00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
being run and managed by the town of
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
for I apologize an easy fix or temporary
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
easy fix um if we could do an easy fix
 
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
uh we would do it um I we sort of talked
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
about one of the easiest fixes when this
 
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:26.200 align:start position:0%
project came up is is disclosing the
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
road off making it right in right out
 
00:36:30.309 --> 00:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
but that from a business standpoint
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
because there are businesses on the
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
corner that's sort of a an an a nogo for
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
for a lot of that so um I I think as an
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
easy no there there's not really an easy
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
we could go out tomorrow and do
 
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
something thank you represent
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
chairman taking my question uh I'm
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
assuming that you've been involved in
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
quite a few roundabouts throughout the
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
state would you have any kind of an
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
estimate on the
 
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
cost it would it would probably be a
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
little bit more um than the signalized
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
intersection is we valued it at or
 
00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839 align:start position:0%
priced it out at about $1.6
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
million based upon historical review
 
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
roundabout I would I would tend to think
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
with the traffic volume on 111 it would
 
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
it would have two lanes on 111 one lane
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
on Irma Road so it' be a hybrid we those
 
00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
are probably in the $2 million range um
 
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
so I it would be more expensive but
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's very little maintenance cost um
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
with a roundabout and it it it does um
 
00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:51.560 align:start position:0%
reduce crashes uh tremendously compared
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
to a signal thank you followup followup
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh do you think that it would uh affect
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
any businesses that might be going in
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
that corner or be at that corner um it
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
it could um the the so with the if we
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
put in a signal the the the sketches of
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
the plans that we saw would be five
 
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
Lanes wide today it's it's
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
two um so or are three lanes wide so
 
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
there's a widening associated with the
 
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
signal the roundabout at the
 
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
intersection would probably be a little
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
bit wider um whether or not it would
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
impact future development I in in
 
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the existing businesses and
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
they appear to be far enough off from
 
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
the the road to not be impacted uh but
 
00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
any future business I'm I'm not sure
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
that would go on the other sides thank
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent fuler question
 
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
is this a project eligible for federal
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
funding and is that at all uh in
 
00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:00.280 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy if this does not meet signal
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
warrants um it well uh highway safety
 
00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
Improvement money is federal money um
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
and if if it doesn't meet signal
 
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
warrants I I would believe we couldn't
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
fund it with Federal wary because they
 
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't allow us to to signalize
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
it I I would also add that we would I
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
believe that the Consultants you
 
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't find a consultant that would
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
design a signal if it didn't meet once
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh so they would back out I would
 
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:34.599 align:start position:0%
believe um I don't think their legal
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
staff would would allow him to do that
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
question seeing none thank you thank you
 
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
is there anyone that has spoken wishes
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
to speak a second time or anyone that
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
hasn't provide a testimony would like to
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
do it this time Reb Sam
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
Sweeney I just want to quickly thank the
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
dot for presenting here I want to make
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
it very clear this is not filed due to a
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
lack of communication with DOT they've
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
been great Partners in this project
 
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
reviewing the the traffic analysis this
 
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
was filed to really just State the
 
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
preference of the town of Salem for a
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
signalized intersection uh considering
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
the the traffic warrant and the analysis
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
that we've been going through with DOT
 
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
uh but just to to put at ease the
 
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:23.720 align:start position:0%
committee dot has been responsive
 
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
communicative I've been working with the
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
town on this as our preference is the
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
signalized intersection so thank you I
 
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
is it is it for a new piece of
 
00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
information representative Newton please
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
would the city city be opposed to a
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
round of all there instead of a traffic
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
traffic light I my sense of what the of
 
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:48.280 align:start position:0%
the Town Council and the the
 
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and residents near the
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
intersection that we've talked to there
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
is severe apprehension about a
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
roundabout uh and there's a preference
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
towards a signal I
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%
questions please
 
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
brief represent
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
B thank you Mr chairman
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
um would the city be uh willing to
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
accept the outcome of the public
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
hearings because it sound like there's

highways well thank you Mr chair
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
honorable colleagues members of the
 
00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
committee um for the record my name is
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
Joe Alexander I represent Hillsboro
 
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
District 29 which is the town of
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
Goffstown um you may know or not know
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
that there was a very special Committee
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
created um at the beginning of last year
 
00:48:17.549 --> 00:48:17.559 align:start position:0%
relative to housing um and the speaker
 
00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
appointed me as chair um the committee
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
consisted of five Republicans and five
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
Democrats and the mission that we had
 
00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
was to find um reasonable solution to
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis affecting our state
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
so with that um this is one of the bills
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
that has resulted from the committee and
 
00:48:34.109 --> 00:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
it came to Public Works and highways
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
because this has to do a lot with public
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
works and highways so um with further
 
00:48:41.829 --> 00:48:41.839 align:start position:0%
Ado um in the special committee
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
specifically we entertain listening to
 
00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
developers Property Owners planning
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
board members Realtors I mean the whole
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
Gambit like when you talk about the
 
00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
housing crisis it really was everybody
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
um you know landlords um tenants tenant
 
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
rights groups everybody and one of the
 
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
things that came about it was the idea
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
that a lot of State permitting takes
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
longer than in some in some ways people
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
would anticipate it should take um so
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
special committee we heard from
 
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:12.799 align:start position:0%
developers and homeowners alike that
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
when a developer makes an application
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
for a permit to do it takes some cases
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
six months or so to sign off on the
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
permit so this bill um would put a
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable timeline in place of 30 days
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
for most cas in 45 days as defined under
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill so section
 
00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
three would be the um commercial
 
00:49:35.309 --> 00:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
industrial Enterprise or subdivision so
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
um so dot considers any roadway that
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
intersects with a highway as a driveway
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
so municipalities also have to deal with
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing um when a
 
00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
municipality tries to put a Road
 
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
intersecting with a state highway so
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's also what would apply under this
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
bill um so pering by so there's three
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
reasons why you should really vote for
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
this bill um it incentivized do to work
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
more collaborative
 
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
collaboratively together with applicants
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
who include the developers Property
 
00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.630 align:start position:0%
who include the developers Property
Owners

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
Owners
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities and you would support
 
00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:08.799 align:start position:0%
property rights by ensuring that there
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
are reasonable timelines in place to
 
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
move forward with projects and you'd be
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
moving the ball in the right direction
 
00:50:15.549 --> 00:50:15.559 align:start position:0%
on the housing crisis I think putting
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable timelines on the department
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
to issue permits they issue about 1,00
 
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
permits a year I think that um that is
 
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
completely reasonable to go Within a
 
00:50:27.789 --> 00:50:27.799 align:start position:0%
30-day timeline um you'll hear from the
 
00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner who probably will or
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
someone from the Department who probably
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
outline the process a little bit more um
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
but I believe even with the es and flows
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
of the permitting process I believe that
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
this is a completely reasonable bill um
 
00:50:42.069 --> 00:50:42.079 align:start position:0%
that will help give a more concrete
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
timeline for people that apply for
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
driveway permitting that could be people
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
towns developers Etc so um I also have
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
excuse me I passed around an amendment
 
00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
that removes the planning board from
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
this um timeline process defined in the
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
bill so um this amendment is supported
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
by nhma um who I've also circulated
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
their letter it would basically only
 
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
apply to dot um but you'll find in most
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
cases municipalities don't take nearly
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
as long to sign off on permits um but
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to take questions
 
00:51:20.109 --> 00:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
about housing process that kind of thing
 
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
but um I think you should support the
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you with the with the
 
00:51:27.549 --> 00:51:27.559 align:start position:0%
amendment yes um representative
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
voy thank you Mr chairman representative
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you for your testimony I
 
00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate it turning to what I guess
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
would be page one of your bill section
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
two lines 10 and 11 we have 30 days and
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
we have within 45 days and my notation
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
is 30 days of what or 45 days of what
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
and my question would be we talking the
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
application yes so it's um it it says on
 
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
line S a written construction permit
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
application must be so from what I read
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
it's must be obtained and filed by the
 
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
department so once that's filed I
 
00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
believe the 30-day window starts then um
 
00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
so the 30 days has to do with most
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
permits and then the 45 it goes to
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial and apply
 
00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
Enterprise or subdivision okay so I I
 
00:52:16.109 --> 00:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chair so I agree with you I
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
just do we want to consider clarifying
 
00:52:21.829 --> 00:52:21.839 align:start position:0%
that down below or are you comfortable
 
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:24.440 align:start position:0%
with line seven provides the
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
amplification necessary to um magnify
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
the 30 days and the 45 days I believe
 
00:52:33.109 --> 00:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
it's pretty straightforward um there are
 
00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
I believe there's only one member other
 
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
than me of the special committee on
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
housing represented makoni was on the
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
committee as well when we actually
 
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:41.559 align:start position:0%
looked at specifically at this language
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
last year before we introduced it as a
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
bill and um I I'm pretty confident that
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
this language makes it pretty clear
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
chairman further question representative
 
00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
pulner please so my understanding is
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
that the department won't look at an
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
application until after the Project's
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
been through site plan review and has
 
00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
received a sign off on the final
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
design uh because that might change
 
00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
process is there a minimum time I mean
 
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
if if if the information is not complete
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
and somebody submits a application early
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
should the department be able to hold
 
00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
off until the the design is finalized by
 
00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
the site plan review process that's a
 
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
great question thank you representative
 
00:53:34.589 --> 00:53:34.599 align:start position:0%
um I see I read written construction
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
permit as a completed written
 
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
construction permit um so I believe that
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't apply until the
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
application is entirely completed and
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
the process has gone through and then
 
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
you'll find
 
00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
um look there's language in this bill
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
that allows the opportunity for um a
 
00:53:54.549 --> 00:53:54.559 align:start position:0%
negotiating process between a permitter
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
and do to make sure that there's a
 
00:53:57.789 --> 00:53:57.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable timeline if if they can't
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
meet the 30 days dot can go to the
 
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
developer and say we can't meet this
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
30-day can you give us x amount more
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
time and they would award that time
 
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully thank you further
 
00:54:09.670 --> 00:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
questions president Mill do you have
 
00:54:11.549 --> 00:54:11.559 align:start position:0%
something oh I'm sorry representative
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
Abbott thank you for that yes thank you
 
00:54:15.549 --> 00:54:15.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
question um does as I recall when we
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
considered a similar bill before there
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
was a um a question raised about what if
 
00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
there is a change in the
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
development does that provide a window
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
do so um I'm going to defer the question
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
because I'm not entirely sure of that so
 
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna pass that
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
it was a pleasure of course serving on
 
00:55:02.349 --> 00:55:02.359 align:start position:0%
that committee and uh and I know the
 
00:55:05.549 --> 00:55:05.559 align:start position:0%
governor and um and other departments
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
are anxious to speed along the process
 
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:11.720 align:start position:0%
especially with housing for uh for the
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
state um but I want to bring the
 
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
conversation back to the issuing of uh
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
driveway permits and I had brought this
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
point up before your location and where
 
00:55:26.029 --> 00:55:26.039 align:start position:0%
you are in the state can be a Factor on
 
00:55:26.039 --> 00:55:27.109 align:start position:0%
you are in the state can be a Factor on
how

00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
quick permits are
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
provided I live in a Northern Mo section
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
and permits happen in in a regular
 
00:55:40.829 --> 00:55:40.839 align:start position:0%
timely basis there are there are some
 
00:55:44.069 --> 00:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
areas that are south of me and west of
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
me that it just seems to take longer
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
every time to do
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
that um I'm not disc disparaging dot
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
officials or what whatever but I I and
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
the issue that was brought forward by a
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
lot of developers and trying to bring
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
big projects forward is at that time
 
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:07.960 align:start position:0%
even elapses and makes it extremely more
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
difficult so um what am I correct in my
 
00:56:14.029 --> 00:56:14.039 align:start position:0%
in my assumption of what I heard during
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
those public hearings yes Mr chair that
 
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
was um what I what I understand the
 
00:56:20.109 --> 00:56:20.119 align:start position:0%
conversation to be about as well is that
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
there's a discrepancy on different parts
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
of the state and the timeline it takes
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions seeing
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
representative um I will I tried to jump
 
00:56:37.069 --> 00:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
you into last hearing Ben Frost would
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
housing thank you Mr chairman and good
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
morning committee members my name is Ben
 
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
Frost I'm the deputy executive director
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
and chief legal officer at New Hampshire
 
00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.390 align:start position:0%
and chief legal officer at New Hampshire
house

00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
we're not normally before this committee
 
00:56:58.910 --> 00:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
so I'll just give you two seconds of of
 
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
who we are and what we do we're not a
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
state agency we are a public
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
instrumentality of the state created by
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature in
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
1981 uh for the purpose of doing among
 
00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:12.200 align:start position:0%
other things uh financing the
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
development and uh long-term asset
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
management of multif family uh housing
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
rental housing and some that's something
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
we do on an annual basis all over the
 
00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
state so we don't we don't build we
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
don't own the housing but we Finance it
 
00:57:30.029 --> 00:57:30.039 align:start position:0%
and as a financing entity uh we
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
recognize that for developers and I
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
would say in particular for developers
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
of uh affordable housing time really is
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
money for affordable housing developers
 
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's money that they cannot pass on
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
to the end user the the renters because
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh the rents are controlled uh their
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
profit is controlled uh so it's
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
something that they absorb uh the cost
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
of delays
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
so whenever there is a delay from any
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
Source uh that is costly for developers
 
00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
of uh all types of housing but in
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
particular for affordable housing uh for
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
that reason uh we are in support of
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
122 and thank representative Alexander
 
00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:15.039 align:start position:0%
for uh introducing it uh I I'll note a
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
couple things and representative
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
Alexander uh did talk about the the
 
00:58:21.069 --> 00:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
ability of uh the department to
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
negotiate with with applicants uh
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
there's also the opportunity for the
 
00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
Department to say no if an application
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
is incomplete and they're coming up
 
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:31.640 align:start position:0%
against the 30 or 45 day deadline they
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
can say we're denying this application
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
it is it is incomplete uh and and that's
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
really the onus is on the applicant to
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
present complete and final information
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
to the department uh and then for the
 
00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
Department to be able to review that um
 
00:58:52.109 --> 00:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
I I recognize that 30 and 45 days is a
 
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
it's a number uh is that the right
 
00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
number I don't know exactly uh but I
 
00:58:59.069 --> 00:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
think that for applicants to public
 
00:59:02.829 --> 00:59:02.839 align:start position:0%
agencies to have some reasonable idea of
 
00:59:04.589 --> 00:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
how long something is going to take is
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
not an unreasonable request uh and I
 
00:59:09.309 --> 00:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
think that that's incumbent upon any
 
00:59:09.319 --> 00:59:10.190 align:start position:0%
think that that's incumbent upon any
public

00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:59:13.829 --> 00:59:13.839 align:start position:0%
agency um with regard to the amendment
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
and this is I'm speaking to Amendment
 
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
0470 um this is designed to align
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
with existing perit deadlines that
 
00:59:28.109 --> 00:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
planning boards already deal with so if
 
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
you look at the Planning and Zoning
 
00:59:33.309 --> 00:59:33.319 align:start position:0%
statutes uh planning boards are required
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
once they accept jurisdiction of an
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
application they're required to come to
 
00:59:39.549 --> 00:59:39.559 align:start position:0%
a final decision on subdivision or site
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
plan applications within 65 days that is
 
00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
a statutory time frame uh so this is a
 
00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:47.799 align:start position:0%
time frame that is very familiar to
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
local planning boards and by extension
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
if they're if they're uh delegating that
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility to say a local DPW uh
 
00:59:59.829 --> 00:59:59.839 align:start position:0%
then the time would also apply there um
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions but
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
again we support this build with the
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
amendment any questions yes please
 
01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
R so if it could take up to 65 days to
 
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
get a completed application through the
 
01:00:17.069 --> 01:00:17.079 align:start position:0%
planning board at that point they would
 
01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
apply for a permit and then their 30 or
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
45 day whichever is uh applicable would
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
then start because you now have signed
 
01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.150 align:start position:0%
then start because you now have signed
off

01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
prints thank you for the question and
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
let me clarify this um the Dot's role is
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
for Access permits on state highways
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
Municipal action on driveway permits is
 
01:00:46.589 --> 01:00:46.599 align:start position:0%
only on Municipal highways that is class
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
five and class six highways uh so those
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
are two separate processes on state
 
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
highways dos jurisdiction on Town
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
highways the town has jurisdiction the
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
planning board has jurisdiction by
 
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
Statute so there would be no additional
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
process on a Town Highway once the town
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
grants the access permit if the the the
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
property owner has the
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
permit oh followup
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
please as for a state highway then would
 
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
it be
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
different uh great question
 
01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
representative uh there the section and
 
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm talking about the the bill is
 
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
introduced page two lines 18 through 30
 
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
um that is the local process uh and that
 
01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
is different from the uh planning board
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
role with site plan and subdivision
 
01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:45.039 align:start position:0%
review so typically let's say you have a
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
a development that's on a state highway
 
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
uh the property owner knows the
 
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
developer knows that they're going to
 
01:01:54.109 --> 01:01:54.119 align:start position:0%
have to go to do at some point uh to get
 
01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
an access permit but they're not going
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
to do that until they know what it is
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
the planning board is approving because
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
the planning board board may say no we
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
want your driveway over there even
 
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
though the department May disagree and
 
01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:08.839 align:start position:0%
ultimately it is it it is up to the
 
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
department to say where those things go
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
and that might be some matter of
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
negotiation that involves the developer
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
and the town and the department uh so
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
that that can take some time if for
 
01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
let's say um in this came up in an
 
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
earlier question let's say a planning
 
01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
board approves a site plan for a
 
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
commercial development or for a
 
01:02:34.109 --> 01:02:34.119 align:start position:0%
residential development and it has a a
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
sh driveway shown on the the approved
 
01:02:37.079 --> 01:02:37.910 align:start position:0%
sh driveway shown on the the approved
site

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
site
 
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
plan the applicant the property owner
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
then the developer then goes to the
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
department for a driveway permit and the
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
and the department says no we can't put
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
it there for these reasons it has to go
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
here then it's up to the property owner
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
the developer to go back to the planning
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
board and and get an amendment to that
 
01:02:59.230 --> 01:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
approval uh typically speaking uh that
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
well that's a fairly common process uh
 
01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
but it does oftentimes say a planning
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
board will uh give an approval subject
 
01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
to the Department's uh issuance of an
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
access permit and so they they may come
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
back uh at some later point with the
 
01:03:19.269 --> 01:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
changes made by the
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.390 --> 01:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:03:28.589 --> 01:03:28.599 align:start position:0%

housing action New Hampshire we're here
 
01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
support of this uh bill before you uh
 
01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
had a chance to review the amendment we
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
support the amendment as well as Mr
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
Frost just stated oh let me back up
 
01:03:59.349 --> 01:03:59.359 align:start position:0%
housing action New Hampshire uh we are a
 
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
member organization we have over 80
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
members that's made up of uh nonprofit
 
01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
for-profit developers uh housing
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
financers uh service providers children
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
and family advocates and so we have a
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
common goal of coming together and
 
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
ensuring that uh we can work to improve
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
state and federal policy so that
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
everybody has a place to call home uh so
 
01:04:22.029 --> 01:04:22.039 align:start position:0%
with that and with this bill brought
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
forward by representative Alexander from
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
the special committee on housing we
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
would support this because as Mr Frost
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
stated uh it's not our our members any
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
delay cannot necessarily easily absorb
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
those costs so if we can see this as a
 
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
way of getting more units online and
 
01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:39.160 align:start position:0%
getting more people housed we are uh in
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
support of it be happy to attempt to
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you uh
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%

my name is Mike citus I am the director
 
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:14.680 align:start position:0%
of operations for the Hampshire
 
01:05:17.309 --> 01:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation and um
 
01:05:19.029 --> 01:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony
 
01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
regarding this uh this bill the
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
department is committed to providing
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
customer service in uh processing
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
driveway applications as efficiently and
 
01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
uh timely as possible however timeliness
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
of the application is really uh not
 
01:05:38.109 --> 01:05:38.119 align:start position:0%
entirely upon the Department's you know
 
01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:42.799 align:start position:0%
control um a lot of the um the control
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
is really with the applicant to provide
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
um the completeness of the documentation
 
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
which is outlined in the driveway policy
 
01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
the department processes approximately
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
1100 driveway permits annually and the
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
number of major entrance permits which
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
would include subdivisions uh is
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere between two to 7% of that
 
01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:05.440 align:start position:0%
annual number the department approves
 
01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
more than 85% of their requests in under
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
60 days the ones that take longer are
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
generally the larger projects which
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
require traffic impact studies or some
 
01:06:16.589 --> 01:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
kind of mitigation work which needs to
 
01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
be done and approved before the
 
01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
construction approval can be given the
 
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
department must oppose hb12 VES two
 
01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
which in our opinion does not provide
 
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
the department or the applicant
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient time to work through the
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
numerous steps in the design review
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
process our belief that while the
 
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
existing process May in some cases take
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
more time and resources than the
 
01:06:41.309 --> 01:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
applicant wants the time is Justified to
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
protect the safety mobility and the
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
investment the state the state has made
 
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
in the transportation system RSA
 
01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
23613 requires written construction
 
01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
permit to be obtained by the
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation prior to any construction
 
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
or alteration in the public way the goal
 
01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:02.119 align:start position:0%
is to provide safe and efficient
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
operating environment for everybody that
 
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
uses the state transportation system in
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
order to define the uniform application
 
01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
for review and process throughout the
 
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
state the commissioner of the Department
 
01:07:16.589 --> 01:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
of Transportation issued declaratory
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
ruling uh number
 
01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
2000-1 back in March
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
2 this is the policy for the permitting
 
01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
of driveways and other accesses to the
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
state highway which is known as the
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
driveway per uh the driveway manual
 
01:07:33.309 --> 01:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
copies of this can be found on do
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
website along with other uh information
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
such as the permit and how to uh fill
 
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
permit section one of this manual
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
basically outlines the the purpose
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
providing uniform procedures throughout
 
01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
the state for the processing issuance of
 
01:07:52.670 --> 01:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
a driveway permit application in
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
accordance with the following
 
01:07:56.349 --> 01:07:56.359 align:start position:0%
promote the safety and protection of the
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
traveling public through orderly control
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
of traffic movement minimize conflict
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
points verify appropriate site distance
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
of class one and two State highways
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
maintain serviceable uh serviceability
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
on effective highways monitor design and
 
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
construction of driveways and
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
maintenance of RSA
 
01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:18.550 align:start position:0%
maintenance of RSA
23613

01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
23613
 
01:08:22.349 --> 01:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
um rules said in another way the purpose
 
01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
of the driveway policy is to protect the
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
state's investment in our transportation
 
01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
system by providing access it will not
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
only erode the safety and efficiency of
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
the existing transportation system
 
01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
within the requirements of the law
 
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
standards basically safety and Corridor
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
management is critical in providing a
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
safe and efficient transportation system
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
to move Mo people movement in
 
01:08:51.910 --> 01:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
Goods unfortunately all driveways and
 
01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
access points create safety and mosil IL
 
01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
issues number one driveways introduce
 
01:08:58.749 --> 01:08:58.759 align:start position:0%
conflict points which degrade safety
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
mobility and serviceability of the road
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
for through
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
traffic second speed differentials and
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
turning movements are increased which
 
01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:09.960 align:start position:0%
also increases the potential for
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
crashes in order to promote the safety
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
and uh Mobility what we try to do is
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
restrict the number and location of
 
01:09:20.829 --> 01:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
points um it was known or we' noted that
 
01:09:26.430 --> 01:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
applications for single family residents
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
small traffic generators make up the uh
 
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
by far the largest group of uh
 
01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
applications we get these applications
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
are normally processed just through the
 
01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
information provided on the forms and
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
the supplemental information which is
 
01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
basically demonstrating the history of
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
the parcel since
 
01:09:47.789 --> 01:09:47.799 align:start position:0%
1971 which provides you know through
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
relevant deeds and then taking a look at
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
the safe site uh site distance at the
 
01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
propos osed location these are normally
 
01:09:59.390 --> 01:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
processed in less than 30 days in um
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
unless there's an issue with um the the
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
process to which the parcel was made or
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
some locations they cannot achieve the
 
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
safe site distance of 400 feet in either
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
direction application reviews for
 
01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
subdivisions of commercial businesses
 
01:10:20.110 --> 01:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
which include residential subdivisions
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh are more
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
complex they're covered section six and
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
there are um essentially a few more uh
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
areas that need to be included within
 
01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:34.310 align:start position:0%
areas that need to be included within
that

01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
application basically you're going to
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
get six major Milestones which are going
 
01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
to require engineering and design
 
01:10:43.229 --> 01:10:43.239 align:start position:0%
leading up to the construction approval
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
the first one uh the major step is
 
01:10:48.189 --> 01:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
submission of that application the
 
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
second is setting up a scoping meeting
 
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
scoping meetings are done are held with
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
state stakeholders and basically to uh
 
01:10:58.350 --> 01:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
identify issues in the transportation
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
Network in the vicinity of that proposed
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
development stakeholders include the
 
01:11:05.950 --> 01:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation the Highway
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
Maintenance District uh traffic Bureau
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
and Highway design it also includes the
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
applicant the municipality and planning
 
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
agencies in the
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
area we do encourage uh municipalities
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
to attend these scoping meetings because
 
01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
we don't like to wait until the end to
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
coordinate with the uh municipalities
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
because what can happen which was
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
discussed is they go ahead and they
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
approve a development with a an access
 
01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
point that is after that is approved is
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
the first time we see an application
 
01:11:44.629 --> 01:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
come in and it's in an area that uh
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
either doesn't meet site distance um it
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
may require offsite improvements that
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
impact other private land that they
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
cannot get easement do at which point
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
they can't do the mitigation so um we
 
01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
prefer to be brought in or discussed
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
these issues and citing locations early
 
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
in the process not at the
 
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
end traffic uh there's a stage where you
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
get the traffic impact study part of the
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
scoping meeting is to define the formal
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
study traffic inpact study basically
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
will will go through and this is
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
generally where they hire a traffic
 
01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
engineer to to determine what the trip
 
01:12:29.590 --> 01:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
generation is going to be how that trip
 
01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
those trips are assigned throughout the
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
study area network they take a look at
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
the operability does the uh additional
 
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
um uh traffic degrade any of the
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
intersection operations is it going to
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
have a impact of the safety on any of
 
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
the areas um that they find or is there
 
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
a known safety impact already in that
 
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
area that this might aggravate
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
um and it also we we'll take a look at U
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
impacts once the next big step is once
 
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
the department agrees with the findings
 
01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
and the um modeling of that traffic um
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
traffic study is they really move on to
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
that mitigation stage is what is it if
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
anything that the development needs to
 
01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
do to mitigate their traffic impacts on
 
01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
that on the state
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
system once this this these traic
 
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
impacts could be um something like just
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
putting out signing could be adding a
 
01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
roundabout could be looking at a traffic
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
signal could be minor impacts uh
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
widening of shoulders um or it could be
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
adding auxiliary Lanes you know the the
 
01:13:49.629 --> 01:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
larger the development usually the
 
01:13:52.270 --> 01:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
larger the impact they have and that's
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
where we start getting into to some of
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
these mitigation plans can be quite
 
01:13:59.189 --> 01:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
extensive and again we view that any
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
kind of uh construction on the state
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
highway system really needs to conform
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
to the state's uh standards and design
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
practices because ultimately it becomes
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
part of the state
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure once there's an an
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
agreement on the 30% plan what is the uh
 
01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.149 align:start position:0%
agreement on the 30% plan what is the uh
required

01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
mitigation the applicant then um
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
generates 30% design plan plans and
 
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
these document what the uh what is going
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
to be required to support that um that
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
development from the within the state uh
 
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
RightWay system at this point the
 
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
department um is looking at uh allowing
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
or issuing a conditional approval
 
01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
similar to what local local improvements
 
01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
can do or local authorities can do but
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a construction approval
 
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
but it does basically say the department
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
is is in agreement with what is going to
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
be provided uh or constructed out there
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
and once all the plans uh easements
 
01:15:05.390 --> 01:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
permits uh in bonding is set up there
 
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
permit it's understood that you know
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
these larger projects can take
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time um it takes a
 
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
lot of engineering time to provide pres
 
01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
prepare the plans and the studies it
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of time time for the
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
department or through their Consultants
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
to review them
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
um we probably and and we're probably
 
01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
not telling anything new but you know
 
01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:35.310 align:start position:0%
not telling anything new but you know
our

01:15:35.310 --> 01:15:35.320 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
our number of applications has increased
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
40% over the last five years in that
 
01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
same time frame we've lost 25% of our
 
01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:47.719 align:start position:0%
engineering staff this is really uh
 
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
changed our our I guess our our process
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
that we are relying a lot more more on
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
the consultant Community to do our uh
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
reviews and um that kind of
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
turnaround the consultant Community
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
isn't doing a lot better than we are um
 
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
on on folks on engineering staff so that
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
has not exactly changed the amount of
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
time it is taking to process these in
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
addition when you send these out to the
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
Consultants you still need to have an
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
internal review to get consistency
 
01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:27.159 align:start position:0%
because what we don't want to do is send
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
out plans in one section of the state
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
using one consultant that has a
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
different Viewpoint than another so what
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
we try to do is come up with some kind
 
01:16:39.629 --> 01:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
of consistency in our reviews the other
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
part is we have reviews by Highway we
 
01:16:45.149 --> 01:16:45.159 align:start position:0%
have reviewed by the uh Traffic Division
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
and we'll have reviewed by maintenance
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
before we submit comments back to an
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
applicant or an engineer we want to make
 
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
sure that we give them One Direction on
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
that because we may have multiple
 
01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:01.159 align:start position:0%
internally multiple ideas on what should
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
time let's see I will say that we we
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
have been engaged for for some time and
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
uh I'm trying to come up with ways to
 
01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
speed along and make this process more
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
transparent um over the last year we
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
have been engaged with working on the
 
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
state permit tracking system um this is
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
a initiative that's trying to get all
 
01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
the state permits to be in one location
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
uh our choice to uh to to really start
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
the system for for the dot was the
 
01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
driveway permit that is the most
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
important permit uh that we want to try
 
01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
to get handle and move along so we we
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
are making slow progress but the idea is
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
to to find a syst system where it's
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
easier to transmit and receive
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
information from the applicants the
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
engineers and also make it more
 
01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
transparent where the process is who's
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
who's got the review who's got the ball
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
at that time that becomes a big
 
01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
issue um I guess in conclusion um
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
because I'm probably taking up too much
 
01:18:19.030 --> 01:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
time as as it is um the department
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
understands there may be times when the
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
applicants feel that we're we're taking
 
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
too much time on this however the
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
department sees its role is really
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
protecting the safety and Mobility for
 
01:18:32.629 --> 01:18:32.639 align:start position:0%
the public and the investment that the
 
01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
state has been making in this
 
01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.750 align:start position:0%
state has been making in this
transportation

01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
system the review process really focuses
 
01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:41.560 align:start position:0%
on three things one number one the
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
nature and traffic demand generated by a
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
development seeking access to the state
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
highway number two the impact that
 
01:18:50.830 --> 01:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
development will have on the existing
 
01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
state highway system number three how do
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
we how do we mitigate any adverse
 
01:18:59.229 --> 01:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
impacts while not perfect the department
 
01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
is working hard to review the driveway
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
permit application as quickly as
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
possible admittedly with limited people
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
this is a difficult task but we are
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
looking for other Alternatives you know
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
to speed the process along unfortunately
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
some of our emergency responses to storm
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
and infrastructure failures are also
 
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
done by the same people who do the
 
01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
permitting reviews so that tends the
 
01:19:24.189 --> 01:19:24.199 align:start position:0%
slowest down a
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
bit we look for cooperation willingness
 
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
together with the developers the
 
01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
developers engineers in the department
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
to look to come up with a way to make it
 
01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh the process quicker and more
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
efficient the department does not
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
believe that the public would be uh
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
served better by putting in or
 
01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
instituting strict uh time limits
 
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
because I think what you're going to
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
find is there going to be a lot more
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
denials and that's ultimately going to
 
01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
and then uh we did put in there that as
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
a part of the fiscal note you know if we
 
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
were going to try to come up and hit
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
those or or meet some of those timelines
 
01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
what the uh the cost would be um
 
01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I think even if funded you
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
know we could uh I don't think we could
 
01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
fill the positions um just looking at
 
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
the last three years of of trying to
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
fill positions we we currently have so
 
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
um again that's that's kind of Our
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
Testimony and I'll be happy to answer
 
01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:28.199 align:start position:0%
anybody's questions thank you um if if
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
the committee would indulge me I'd like
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
to start here so
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
um 40% increase in in
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
permitting um Staffing being down 25% I
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
I every Department in the state uses
 
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
that exact same figure where your
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
department environmental services
 
01:20:51.149 --> 01:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
subsurface Wetlands everything else
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
everyone else Consultants everybody body
 
01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
else is operating on that um would you
 
01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
believe and then I'll continue on
 
01:20:59.310 --> 01:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental
 
01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:03.639 align:start position:0%
Services um I'm going to say 20 years
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
ago uh if you were if you were to um
 
01:21:10.990 --> 01:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
submit a an individual application for a
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
septic Disposal system or a septic
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
system that they had on on the books
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
that they had they had 30 days to um to
 
01:21:23.709 --> 01:21:23.719 align:start position:0%
approve or disapprove an application
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
the department for some reason when
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
there was no issue with with number of
 
01:21:31.669 --> 01:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
personnel would take sit on them for 30
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
days issue a letter that it was
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
incomplete and then people would go back
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
in a cycle it was holding up individual
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
homeowners consistently it was a problem
 
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
that was addressed and Department of
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services you had mentioned
 
01:21:47.070 --> 01:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
some things about trying to get these
 
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
things online they they they led the
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
cause on these things their turnaround
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
time is to two days now building a
 
01:21:57.550 --> 01:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
septic system is not building a highway
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
or trying to figure out how to get an
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
off I don't mean to make that
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
correlation but sometimes when a time
 
01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
frame is put in place uh as my father
 
01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
would say it would get my fanny moving
 
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
so and I have nothing but the respect
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
for your department I I need to say that
 
01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:18.030 align:start position:0%
for your department I I need to say that
um

01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps um and this would be a question
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
for the sponsor and maybe I could have
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
the sponsor address this after uh if I
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
if I look at the the
 
01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
LSR and I get down to uh line 20 of the
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
first page under section three for
 
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
Access of a proposed commercial
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
subdivision let's let's say I was to
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
adopt the position of the department
 
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
that this is too broad for this amount
 
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
of time with the amount of Personnel I
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
had I'm wondering if you have some idea
 
01:22:59.629 --> 01:22:59.639 align:start position:0%
how many of the applications or could
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
get back to myself or the U sponsor how
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
many of these
 
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
applications are for housing
 
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:12.440 align:start position:0%
developments or a multi-use development
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
which would have possibly some
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
commercial with a lot of apartments and
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
so forth on it and for my argument of
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
sake it would be a a subdivision that
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
would have over 70% component of housing
 
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
to it if if this were and I know you
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
can't answer this right now or maybe you
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
could offer an opinion uh if if this if
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
there was a section of this that that
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
ask the the department to be under this
 
01:23:47.310 --> 01:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
time frame for this specific item uh I'm
 
01:23:50.189 --> 01:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
again I'm I'm assuming this isn't a huge
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
amount but when I when I look at the
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
charge that the speaker gave to to the
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
um to the special task force the
 
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
governor's position on this and if the
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
governor were to weigh in uh would that
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
make this process any easier for the
 
01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
Department that's a good question and
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
and I think what you're if I can kind of
 
01:24:13.750 --> 01:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
paraphrase it what you're asking is if
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
we separate out residential subdivisions
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
from other larger generators and you
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
know looking at uh the traffic
 
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
generation for residential it's it's not
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
quite as um on on the peak hours it's
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
lower uh we don't generally see as as
 
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
much um mitigation so that may move
 
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
things quicker um so that it it would be
 
01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
a help and I think that' be worth
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
exploring better I think that would
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
be that would that would be a better fit
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh when you cast that bigger net that
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
that really causes some consternation so
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
and I can get back with you and take a
 
01:24:58.030 --> 01:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
look at as far as the housing over the
 
01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
last year so thank thank you sir
 
01:25:03.629 --> 01:25:03.639 align:start position:0%
questions represent fauler thank you
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the taking the question
 
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
following up on Chairman's question gave
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
the example of
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
subsurface U discharge
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
permits and Dees I my understanding is
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
from many classes of these permits they
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
basically take the findings of a uh or
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
the design of a licensed
 
01:25:27.629 --> 01:25:27.639 align:start position:0%
subservice uh
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
disposal um
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
consultant and issue a permit almost
 
01:25:35.229 --> 01:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
automatically is there a parallel here I
 
01:25:39.149 --> 01:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
mean can you trust the um or accept the
 
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
the designs of licensed civil engineers
 
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
on on these projects you know if they
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
meet your meet your standards instead of
 
01:25:49.709 --> 01:25:49.719 align:start position:0%
having to redo or re review every single
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
project at that level of detail
 
01:25:55.470 --> 01:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um you know
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
we do require the designs to be done by
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
professionals and as a PE you can only
 
01:26:04.350 --> 01:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
work within your area of expertise uh we
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
do rely more on you know whether it's a
 
01:26:09.790 --> 01:26:09.800 align:start position:0%
traffic engineer that has that expertise
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
particularly at
 
01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:15.119 align:start position:0%
ptoe um or the designers but we still
 
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
need to review them to um to meet our
 
01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
standards there is a difference um a lot
 
01:26:24.270 --> 01:26:24.280 align:start position:0%
of the engineer are used to more working
 
01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
you know outside of the state RightWay
 
01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
where there's a little more leeway um we
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
we tend to to focus a little harder
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
because um if there's a problem it's the
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
state that has to fix it you know we're
 
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
the ones that have to maintain it we're
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
a lot more uh particular in how things
 
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
are built because of that because
 
01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:47.719 align:start position:0%
there's a public investment into it um
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
yes we do rely more on on on the
 
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
engineers and what they bring up um but
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
as with most things there's a lot
 
01:27:00.310 --> 01:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
of discussion and debate particularly
 
01:27:03.149 --> 01:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
when you get into trip generation you
 
01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
know we try to make that pretty or the
 
01:27:07.149 --> 01:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
engineering community tries to make that
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
fairly straightforward but there's
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
always a bit of a debate so um again I
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
think we're moving those things faster
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
through there but there's always going
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
to be some a review component to
 
01:27:21.119 --> 01:27:22.990 align:start position:0%
to be some a review component to
that

01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
represent Jack uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for appearing I still have my
 
01:27:29.189 --> 01:27:29.199 align:start position:0%
copy of the driveway policy from the
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
last time someone brought a hard
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
deadline bill um it seems like the
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
process for a complex development is
 
01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
just plain going to take longer than 30
 
01:27:43.189 --> 01:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
or 45 days is there a number that the
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
department would be willing to commit to
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh or is that just not not a thing that
 
01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.750 align:start position:0%
uh or is that just not not a thing that
could

01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:27:53.790 --> 01:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
happen thank you for the question the
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
we've been kind of trying to work on
 
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.470 align:start position:0%
we've been kind of trying to work on
that

01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
it's I guess the traffic world is is
 
01:28:03.109 --> 01:28:03.119 align:start position:0%
really related in very well to the the
 
01:28:05.109 --> 01:28:05.119 align:start position:0%
real estate world it's really the
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
location that dictates you know you can
 
01:28:11.070 --> 01:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
have a smaller generator on a road that
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
has 12,000
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
Vehicles a day being as as critical for
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
us to look at is you've got a generator
 
01:28:21.870 --> 01:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
of 600 vehicles but it's on a road that
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
only has 500 Vehicles a day it's it's
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
really that location that we have to
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
take a look at we've been trying to
 
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
figure out a way
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
to I guess categorize things similar to
 
01:28:35.910 --> 01:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
looking at maybe we separate out the
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
residentials is looking at uh traffic
 
01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:42.400 align:start position:0%
generators and not only looking at the
 
01:28:46.590 --> 01:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
number that they generate but that trip
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
end generation but also recognizing
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
what's the volume of traffic on the road
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
in somehow better equating what our
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
requirements are um to that what we've
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
looked at in a few places is taking a
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
look at uh if it's not a a large
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
generator is maybe just documenting the
 
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
traffic through a memo so that we know
 
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
approve uh a five seat restaurant and
 
01:29:17.950 --> 01:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't open up a Dunkin'
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
Donuts on it which is completely
 
01:29:23.229 --> 01:29:23.239 align:start position:0%
different so unfortunately the only way
 
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
we have currently to do that is going
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
through the full traffic impact study
 
01:29:30.669 --> 01:29:30.679 align:start position:0%
and going through it but those are some
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
of the areas we're trying to come up
 
01:29:36.109 --> 01:29:36.119 align:start position:0%
with that that that can maybe speed the
 
01:29:36.119 --> 01:29:37.790 align:start position:0%
with that that that can maybe speed the
process

01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:29:41.950 --> 01:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
over thank you um yes please represent
 
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
jurus thank you Mr
 
01:29:47.109 --> 01:29:47.119 align:start position:0%
chairman currently in the review of the
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
driveway permits especially for the
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
housing is there overtime for for some
 
01:29:54.910 --> 01:29:54.920 align:start position:0%
of the in with your engineering staff
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
and any other technical staff for
 
01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
instance maybe on I suggest but Saturday
 
01:30:02.109 --> 01:30:02.119 align:start position:0%
or something or after hours during the
 
01:30:05.790 --> 01:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
week to help review and in addition uh
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
do you have civil engineering or other
 
01:30:11.709 --> 01:30:11.719 align:start position:0%
engineering um interns from local
 
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
universities that work for the
 
01:30:15.149 --> 01:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
Department as well who could maybe pitch
 
01:30:18.709 --> 01:30:18.719 align:start position:0%
in in this effort to in the review
 
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
process yeah thank you for the question
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
yeah pretty much I hate to say it you
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
know in the legislative building but
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
overtime is pretty much if if they're
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
willing we are willing to to move them
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
along um you know being down so many
 
01:30:38.669 --> 01:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
people that's not impacting our budget
 
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
so much so we we are willing to
 
01:30:43.709 --> 01:30:43.719 align:start position:0%
entertain any of them um intern wise we
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
have been able to start grabbing more
 
01:30:48.669 --> 01:30:48.679 align:start position:0%
interns we are trying to get as many as
 
01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
we can they don't fill quite the area
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
for the reviews but what we can backfill
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
um because again one of our problems are
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have dedicated people that are
 
01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
going to do the traffic or Highway
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
reviews uh right now but being down that
 
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
we have to steal somebody who is
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
probably working on a federal project so
 
01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:13.400 align:start position:0%
that's kind of when they find so what we
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
fig can try to do is get the interns to
 
01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
maybe take some of their work some of
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
the the I I hate this word the grunt
 
01:31:22.830 --> 01:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
work you know cross-sections or
 
01:31:24.990 --> 01:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
something like that but then to maybe
 
01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
free up some time for the more senior
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
people to backfill us but right now the
 
01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
the our biggest U opportunity is we've
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
been trying to lean on the Consulting uh
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
Engineers unfortunately you know like I
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
said they're they're feeling the pinch
 
01:31:45.550 --> 01:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
with getting Engineers as
 
01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
well thank you further question
 
01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:49.030 align:start position:0%
well thank you further question
represent

01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
Boyd thank you Mr chairman and mrvz
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:31:58.750 --> 01:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
you had indicated in your conclusion
 
01:32:01.790 --> 01:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
that and please correct me if I if I'm
 
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
misquoting you that you focus on traffic
 
01:32:08.109 --> 01:32:08.119 align:start position:0%
demand impacts and mitigation when
 
01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
looking at driveway permits is that
 
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
correct yeah pretty much yes okay follow
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
up Mr chair yes please the the issue
 
01:32:19.109 --> 01:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
that I'm struggling with is that you're
 
01:32:20.910 --> 01:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
adding a duplicative process that's
 
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
already done at the local level and
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
having sat on my local planning board
 
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
for close to 10 years we address those
 
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
same very issues when when assessing a
 
01:32:32.910 --> 01:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
piece of property whether it be whether
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
it be multif family use to marac Premium
 
01:32:38.109 --> 01:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
Outlets which I know you're probably
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
very familiar with we my community has
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
run the gamut so my question is with
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
your processes how many times let me
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
rephrases what is the percentage where
 
01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
the state has stepped in and has
 
01:32:53.550 --> 01:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
undercut local jurisdiction on these
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
particular decisions and you've sent the
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
applicant back to a particular
 
01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
municipality to review the issue yeah
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question um
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
this is the reason why we try to get
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
involved early you know we work hard to
 
01:33:11.709 --> 01:33:11.719 align:start position:0%
stay out of the realm
 
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
of uh outside the RightWay that's the
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the towns we try to stay
 
01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:22.280 align:start position:0%
out what we try to focus in on is okay
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
if that particular
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
development generates so much traffic we
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
need to take a look at what that impact
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
is just within the the uh roadway system
 
01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
and that's where we look at the
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
mitigation we would prefer to have that
 
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
discussion with the towns um where we
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
can which which we you know what we
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately strive for but you know
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
realistically we just basically you know
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
we don't try to dictate what they can
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
build on that property it's once that's
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
that's decided on and what that
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
traffic's generated that's when we look
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
at it is what happens when that traffic
 
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
gets out on to the state highway
 
01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
system follow up thank you Mr chairman
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
so in in that particular aspect is there
 
01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:10.629 align:start position:0%
so in in that particular aspect is there
any

01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:34:13.109 --> 01:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
particular prohibition
 
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
rule with do that would
 
01:34:20.830 --> 01:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
prevent any any applicant coming to a
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
municipality going to need a driveway
 
01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
basically a curve cut that it's going to
 
01:34:27.109 --> 01:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
need a curve cut pinit to utilize the
 
01:34:30.430 --> 01:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
scoping meeting in advance to begin the
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
process sooner than later so that based
 
01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
on my my colleague's propos rule that
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
the eyes are daughter the teas across
 
01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
the eggs are in one basket and that the
 
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
30-day to 45 day rule might actually
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
make sense if if applicant in a
 
01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
particular community that rely upon a
 
01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:50.360 align:start position:0%
state roadway can utilize the scoping
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
meeting meeting to their Advantage yeah
 
01:34:54.910 --> 01:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
but we would encourage them to come you
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
know as many people to come to that
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
scoping meeting just to set that that
 
01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.790 align:start position:0%
scoping meeting just to set that that
stage

01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
stage
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
up thank you thank you thank you Mr
 
01:35:05.709 --> 01:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
chairman uh represent
 
01:35:09.149 --> 01:35:09.159 align:start position:0%
Newman yes thank you how many people are
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
on your engineering staff right
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
now have to get back to you on that one
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
um uh are you talking within operations
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
or are you
 
01:35:22.510 --> 01:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
talking dist state
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
do I'm I'm just looking for the number
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
when you had said that you've got 25%
 
01:35:30.709 --> 01:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
loss of your engineering staff I'm I'm
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
looking like how many people are we
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
talking I can I can get back to you oh
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
there's still left I'll have to get back
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
to on that number because what we what
 
01:35:42.070 --> 01:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
we look at is the number up in project
 
01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
development which that would be Bill
 
01:35:46.590 --> 01:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
oldenberg who was here before he's on
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
that side um on mine I can tell you that
 
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
our engineer um we were without a
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
assistant District engineer in District
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
5 which was out of uh bow does a self
 
01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
Center we were out with him for six
 
01:36:03.629 --> 01:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
months they've been out without a uh
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
engineer that does our
 
01:36:09.629 --> 01:36:09.639 align:start position:0%
uh is an accessing utilities engineer he
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
does the driveway permits uh we've been
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
with that F we just filled after two
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
years uh the a the guy that does the uh
 
01:36:20.310 --> 01:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
field reviews that position's been
 
01:36:22.709 --> 01:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
vacant for a year that's just in one
 
01:36:27.350 --> 01:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
District so engineering wise I would say
 
01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
we in operations are probably around 30%
 
01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.550 align:start position:0%
we in operations are probably around 30%
short

01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
short
 
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:33.560 align:start position:0%
upstairs I'll have to get the numbers
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
for you so you followup
 
01:36:40.109 --> 01:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you when if you have to go to
 
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
a consultant to take care of work are
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
they paid the same as your regular
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
people no they're paid under the
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
consultant their fees so so they
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the the Consulting that you
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
know they they ended up they put in for
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
a Statewide contract we have several
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
engineering contracts throughout the
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
department operations
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
we hadn't had them till I think about
 
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
two years ago was the first time we
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
started getting those because we needed
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
people um these are put out um through
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
project development but that they set
 
01:37:18.790 --> 01:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
their their fee structure going through
 
01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
the contract so no they we pay them at
 
01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
their rates thank you thank you
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:32.669 --> 01:37:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
question how long would you say a
 
01:37:38.109 --> 01:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
traffic study would take is one part of
 
01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:41.320 align:start position:0%
the question and number two if a local
 
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
planning board has made the requirement
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
of a traffic study does the state accept
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
that traffic
 
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
study so that it doesn't have to
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
duplicate the Su study
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
again um thank you for the question uh
 
01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.470 align:start position:0%
again um thank you for the question uh
traffic

01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:02.149 align:start position:0%
traffic
study

01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:38:07.149 --> 01:38:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
um probably well you've got to get you
 
01:38:12.430 --> 01:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
know time of year is tough if right now
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
to go out and track count traffic is a
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
little difficult because you know you've
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
got to get in between storms you don't
 
01:38:20.830 --> 01:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
have really good data if particularly
 
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
let's say say you're doing a project on
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
Route One down in Hampton you're not
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
getting the same type but we can equate
 
01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
that kind of time so um generally they I
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
think most engineering firms could if
 
01:38:36.109 --> 01:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
they focused on it right within a couple
 
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
weeks you could generate it um again
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
that's F putting them in between what
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
other and what size um that's a that's a
 
01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
big one uh in New Hampshire we generally
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
look at uh oper looking at operations
 
01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
the driveway and potentially if they're
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
close by the intersection either side so
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of generating work or
 
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
or evaluation work but you know that
 
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
that's you know I hate to speak for
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
other engineering firms but just going
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
back in my my past that that's probably
 
01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
the best I could do is come up with
 
01:39:15.629 --> 01:39:15.639 align:start position:0%
about three three to four weeks um can
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
we take from a planning board yes I mean
 
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
we would take a look at it because they
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
maybe again they may be looking at from
 
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
a little bit different point of view
 
01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:26.360 align:start position:0%
than us but again if we could meet at
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
the uh scoping study before or while
 
01:39:31.870 --> 01:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
they're going through the planning board
 
01:39:34.149 --> 01:39:34.159 align:start position:0%
process and come up with one study that
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
meets most needs yeah I I would highly
 
01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:37.750 align:start position:0%
meets most needs yeah I I would highly
encourage

01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
01:39:41.589 --> 01:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
that thank you uh any further
 
01:39:43.709 --> 01:39:43.719 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your time thank
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
you very much I'd like to bring forward
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%

uh hadn't plan on speaking um
 
01:40:06.270 --> 01:40:06.280 align:start position:0%
specifically on this bill I did sign in
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
in support of it uh for the record Jason

stock New Hampshire Timberland Owners
 
01:40:14.189 --> 01:40:14.199 align:start position:0%
Association I think I was here last week
 
01:40:17.550 --> 01:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
talking driveways are U yeah class six
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
roads our we have forestry operation
 
01:40:23.709 --> 01:40:23.719 align:start position:0%
there are about 2 to 3,000 Timber
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
harvests that occur across the state
 
01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
every year some of those access the
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
access point is off a state road and
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
when we when our policy committee saw
 
01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:34.790 align:start position:0%
when we when our policy committee saw
this

01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
bill they they they endorsed it because
 
01:40:41.310 --> 01:40:41.320 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing and what we're
 
01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:42.679 align:start position:0%
observing is
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in getting a driveway
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
permit um and it it can vary from
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
districts and I think what you had heard
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
from probably the fire speaker that may
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
do be due to Staffing things of that
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
nature but if you're planning a Timber
 
01:40:59.950 --> 01:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
Harvest particularly at sensitive times
 
01:41:01.950 --> 01:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
of the year such as now when you have
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
weather changing and you're trying to
 
01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
plan and say all right I've got to get
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
my Crews ready to go what's my timetable
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
look like if you have a permit or if you
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
if you're waiting on a driveway permit
 
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
that can take and it's a big question
 
01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
mark I spoke to a couple contractors
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's been two months since they've heard
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
anything or seen anything it gets
 
01:41:30.030 --> 01:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
disruptive so whether the number is 30
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
45 some certainty is really beneficial
 
01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
because that provides some
 
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
planning um we get their their temporary
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
permits for for Timber harvesting and
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's a specific document and we we
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that many times you're
 
01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
entering off of an area that you use 15
 
01:41:55.669 --> 01:41:55.679 align:start position:0%
years ago 10 years ago designs pretty
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
much the same logging trucks haven't
 
01:42:00.030 --> 01:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
evolved a whole lot in the last 10 to 15
 
01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
years and so what when I spoke to do
 
01:42:07.629 --> 01:42:07.639 align:start position:0%
about this issue last fall um we were
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
kind of anxious and excited to hear that
 
01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
there might be a online permitting
 
01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
process where I say I'm a Forester and I
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
did a Timber sale off of Route 16 here
 
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
was the road I here's the access road I
 
01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:23.320 align:start position:0%
could just basically either reference
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
that submit it and almost have an online
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
process unless something has
 
01:42:33.550 --> 01:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
changed but um we haven't again we're
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
waiting to hear on that I think you had
 
01:42:37.430 --> 01:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
heard there is some effort going on
 
01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
within the department to try and at
 
01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
least create a transparency on a
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
timetable but right now the situation
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
that we're facing and we're wrangling
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
with is this you know uncertainty you
 
01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
find file file an application and it
 
01:42:55.470 --> 01:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
kind of goes into a black box and when
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
they call the engineer they'll say I'll
 
01:42:58.830 --> 01:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
get to it when I get to
 
01:43:02.189 --> 01:43:02.199 align:start position:0%
it all right I've got I've got a half
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
dozen guys that want to get out and and
 
01:43:07.589 --> 01:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
move onto that job what do I tell them
 
01:43:10.229 --> 01:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
so again I'm happy to work with the
 
01:43:12.669 --> 01:43:12.679 align:start position:0%
committee if there's efforts to look at
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
this bill look at this concept and say
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
all right this isn't the construction of
 
01:43:21.589 --> 01:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
a large marac Shopping Center
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
this is an access it's an access that's
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
been used in the past we're going to do
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
the exact same thing maybe you kind of
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
create some criteria and some categories
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
but happy to work with the Department
 
01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
with you folks on that again I just
 
01:43:38.350 --> 01:43:38.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise that because sitting
 
01:43:40.109 --> 01:43:40.119 align:start position:0%
here in the audience all I'm hearing
 
01:43:43.229 --> 01:43:43.239 align:start position:0%
about is single family homes shopping
 
01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
centers Dunkin Donuts well there's
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
another world out there and that's
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
Timber cutting some of that does access
 
01:43:53.470 --> 01:43:53.480 align:start position:0%
state roads we are subject to driveway
 
01:43:56.149 --> 01:43:56.159 align:start position:0%
permits and I think the permits
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
generally work but they don't always
 
01:44:01.589 --> 01:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
work in terms of timing and so in as
 
01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
much as we can provide some certainty
 
01:44:05.070 --> 01:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
appreciated I'm not an expert on this
 
01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
there are others that are I'm happy to
 
01:44:11.229 --> 01:44:11.239 align:start position:0%
try and answer any questions and I
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate your your time this morning
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
stock thank you thank
 
01:44:25.229 --> 01:44:25.239 align:start position:0%
you I believe that is all the pink cards
 
01:44:28.350 --> 01:44:28.360 align:start position:0%
I have um if we could get the blue sheet
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
sent forward are there any sponsor or
 
01:44:33.390 --> 01:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
anyone who testified would like an
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak a second time would
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
the sponsor take a question from the
 
01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:44.310 align:start position:0%
the sponsor take a question from the
chair

01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely um repres I had asked a
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
question of the department if if the
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
scope of this
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
LSR were to U be restricted a little
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
more than it is right now and it seemed
 
01:44:58.639 --> 01:44:59.910 align:start position:0%
more than it is right now and it seemed
in

01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:45:04.189 --> 01:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
just a global view that that might U
 
01:45:05.950 --> 01:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
make might make a difference I'm
 
01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if we might expect after uh
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
this is an early bill for us that we
 
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:13.840 align:start position:0%
need to get out I don't need to get it
 
01:45:16.709 --> 01:45:16.719 align:start position:0%
out today I'm wondering if the sponsor
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
may consider a change uh you don't need
 
01:45:22.109 --> 01:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
to commit to anything but I would just
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
like to have some
 
01:45:27.589 --> 01:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
direction um that might be something we
 
01:45:30.990 --> 01:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
could talk about other than inm
 
01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
study yes so short answer thank you for
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
the question the answer is yes I think
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
that this the reason this bill was filed
 
01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:40.679 align:start position:0%
was to deal with maybe perhaps some of
 
01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
these larger subdivisions not being
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
approved at a reasonable time um so if
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
dot can get back to us with the data in
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
a reasonable time then we can kind of
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
look at that um I'm certainly open to it
 
01:45:51.709 --> 01:45:51.719 align:start position:0%
but again again this is now the
 
01:45:54.589 --> 01:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
committee's bill um so I'm happy to
 
01:45:56.430 --> 01:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
defer to the committee if they prefer
 
01:45:58.990 --> 01:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
Thank you Rich
 
01:46:01.229 --> 01:46:01.239 align:start position:0%
Boer thank you Mr
 
01:46:01.239 --> 01:46:04.430 align:start position:0%
Boer thank you Mr
chairman

01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
um if the default happens and the permit
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
is forced to be
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
issued and then there's a turns up
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's a design
 
01:46:18.750 --> 01:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
flaw and an accident happens
 
01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
in legal r ramification happens who is
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
the state on the hook for that is the
 
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
local municipality on the hook for
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
that who's on the hook thank you for the
 
01:46:34.109 --> 01:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
question there's language in here saying
 
01:46:36.149 --> 01:46:36.159 align:start position:0%
that dot is allowed to say that they
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
haven't had reasonable time to look at
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
this permit yet so um I believe that in
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
that case they wouldn't be held
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
responsible because they said they
 
01:46:44.589 --> 01:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
haven't had time to look into
 
01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative um I anyone

friends of Osby rail trail whose purpose
 
03:18:06.630 --> 03:18:06.640 align:start position:0%

Fort has been stonewalled by the state
 
03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
for many years while attempting to
 
03:18:20.229 --> 03:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
improve and enhance the RO rail Corridor
 
03:18:22.030 --> 03:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
their request to utilize the rail bed
 
03:18:23.550 --> 03:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
and explore new opportunities have
 
03:18:25.830 --> 03:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
fallen on De years after years of
 
03:18:27.429 --> 03:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
frustration I had an inspiration
 
03:18:30.070 --> 03:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
literally from a dream the night before
 
03:18:32.269 --> 03:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
the LSR filing period deadline ended
 
03:18:34.590 --> 03:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
that I forced doot to do something via
 
03:18:37.469 --> 03:18:37.479 align:start position:0%
railbed legislation so the bill before

03:19:47.750 --> 03:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
organizations are in in strong support
 
03:19:49.550 --> 03:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
of this recently proposed amendment that
 
03:19:51.670 --> 03:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
would focus on the removal of the rails
 
03:19:53.670 --> 03:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
and formalizing the corridor as a
 
03:19:57.110 --> 03:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
recreational rail trail I am also Vice

working on walkable
 
03:20:10.229 --> 03:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
Trails uh I have dedicated considerable
 
03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
time and effort to supporting our Loc
 
03:20:14.389 --> 03:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
local community and to encouraging usage
 
03:20:16.750 --> 03:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
of many outdoor recreation opportunities
 
03:20:19.950 --> 03:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
for the area the economic social
 
03:20:21.670 --> 03:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
physical and mental benefits of
 
03:20:24.070 --> 03:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
recreational rail Trails have been well
 
03:20:25.670 --> 03:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
documented in many studies in New
 
03:20:29.189 --> 03:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the rest of the country in
 
03:20:31.269 --> 03:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
2021 uh the University of New Hampshire
 
03:20:33.670 --> 03:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
extension in collaboration with the atin
 
03:20:35.830 --> 03:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
Economic Development Council presented a
 
03:20:38.309 --> 03:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
report strengthening connections this
 
03:20:40.349 --> 03:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
was an extensive project that gathered
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
information over several years regarding
 
03:20:45.150 --> 03:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
the possibility of using the underlied
 
03:20:47.670 --> 03:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
underutilized existing rail Corridor
 
03:20:49.550 --> 03:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
this Corridor meanders through uh
 
03:20:51.990 --> 03:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
woodlands and oopy which is located at
 
03:20:53.710 --> 03:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
the entrance of Mount Washington Valley
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
and is part of the Lakes Region we
 
03:20:58.150 --> 03:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
encourage you to read this report if you
 
03:20:59.110 --> 03:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
have the
 
03:21:03.030 --> 03:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
time uh it is actually on the oop um
 
03:21:06.349 --> 03:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
website under uh oedc resources since
 
03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
the report has been presented oy has
 
03:21:10.349 --> 03:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
already made improvements with sidewalks
 
03:21:12.990 --> 03:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
lighting and signage small businesses
 
03:21:15.070 --> 03:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
such as a coffee shop parir salon and
 
03:21:18.349 --> 03:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
sewing alteration store in a town center
 
03:21:21.469 --> 03:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
have also been open there are many
 
03:21:24.510 --> 03:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
benefits uh uh of a rail trail in a
 
03:21:27.349 --> 03:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
small town and I would just like to cite
 
03:21:30.150 --> 03:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
some of them Trails boost spending at
 
03:21:32.710 --> 03:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
local businesses that make communities
 
03:21:35.990 --> 03:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
more attractive places to live Trails
 
03:21:37.710 --> 03:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
influence business location and
 
03:21:37.720 --> 03:21:39.309 align:start position:0%
influence business location and
relocation

03:21:39.309 --> 03:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
relocation
 
03:21:41.830 --> 03:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
decisions they reduce medical costs by
 
03:21:43.830 --> 03:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
by encouraging exercise and other
 
03:21:46.429 --> 03:21:46.439 align:start position:0%
healthy outdoor activities they
 
03:21:48.990 --> 03:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
Revitalize depressed areas creating a
 
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
demand for space in what were once
 
03:21:53.790 --> 03:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
vacant buildings Trails provide
 
03:21:56.070 --> 03:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
transportation options and cut fuel
 
03:21:58.910 --> 03:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
expenses they provide low or no cost
 
03:22:01.349 --> 03:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
Recreation for families with low cost
 
03:22:03.710 --> 03:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
relative to other recreational services
 
03:22:06.030 --> 03:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
that could be provided by the government
 
03:22:08.510 --> 03:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
they increase tax revenues in the
 
03:22:10.429 --> 03:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
communities in which they are located
 
03:22:12.309 --> 03:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
and these benefits represent a huge
 
03:22:14.269 --> 03:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
economic return on the money invested
 
03:22:16.469 --> 03:22:16.479 align:start position:0%
into their Trail projects I'm sure some
 
03:22:18.870 --> 03:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
of you have rail trails in your own
 
03:22:21.349 --> 03:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
constituencies and you know the value of
 
03:22:24.229 --> 03:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
that additionally with the Cotton Valley
 
03:22:26.229 --> 03:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
rail trail to the Southwest the Mount
 
03:22:28.510 --> 03:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
Washington Valley W trail to the North
 
03:22:29.750 --> 03:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
and the mountain division Trail and
 
03:22:31.990 --> 03:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
fryberg Main to the Northeast having
 
03:22:34.229 --> 03:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
this rail Corridor become a recreational
 
03:22:36.349 --> 03:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
path would add to the network helping to
 
03:22:39.550 --> 03:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
connect these communities along the way
 
03:22:40.990 --> 03:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
it is important that this Corridor be
 
03:22:43.630 --> 03:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
actively used some way so it can help
 
03:22:45.750 --> 03:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
stimulate Economic Development and
 
03:22:48.550 --> 03:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
Community Connections in our opinion the
 
03:22:50.030 --> 03:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
best way to achieve these results would
 
03:22:51.790 --> 03:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
be to convert this rail Corridor into a
 
03:22:54.309 --> 03:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
recreational rail trail having this
 
03:22:57.229 --> 03:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
vital piece of landscape sit dormant is
 
03:22:59.590 --> 03:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
a waste of valuable asset to all the
 
03:23:01.469 --> 03:23:01.479 align:start position:0%
communities that surround it it is time
 
03:23:03.750 --> 03:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
to move forward with a positive and
 
03:23:06.750 --> 03:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
impactful outcome I and the groups I
 
03:23:09.469 --> 03:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
represent urge you to pass this Bill
 
03:23:11.309 --> 03:23:11.319 align:start position:0%

one question um your WR your written
 
03:23:21.189 --> 03:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
testimony was that given to us in this
 
03:23:24.150 --> 03:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
original package uh what did we do have
 
03:23:26.630 --> 03:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you yeah I'm taking it it
 
03:23:27.790 --> 03:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
comes from some of the letters that I

wrote and I picked a few from here and
 
03:23:31.750 --> 03:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
there that's all thank you very much the
 
03:23:33.309 --> 03:23:33.319 align:start position:0%
one I did is probably not in your
 
03:23:35.070 --> 03:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
package is the actual listing of the
 
03:23:37.030 --> 03:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
benefits of the rail trail to a small
 
03:23:38.830 --> 03:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
town I'm happy to leave a copy of that
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
please okay because I think you would
 
03:23:42.590 --> 03:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
find that to be very useful question
 
03:23:45.510 --> 03:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay all right okay mind okay you want
 
03:23:48.990 --> 03:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
you have a question okay any other
 
03:23:51.389 --> 03:23:51.399 align:start position:0%
questions uh from the committee of Mr
 
03:23:53.349 --> 03:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
Elliot please yes represent jurus please
 
03:23:56.189 --> 03:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman U Mr Elliot
 
03:23:58.710 --> 03:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
is it going to be the the charge of the
 
03:24:01.990 --> 03:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
dot to remove the rails the the I I
 
03:24:03.429 --> 03:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
think that's to be determined that's an
 
03:24:05.110 --> 03:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
answer I can't I can't really give you I
 
03:24:06.870 --> 03:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
don't know where we stand with that uh I
 
03:24:09.269 --> 03:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
know our group uh will help out any way
 
03:24:11.990 --> 03:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
they can uh obviously there's fund that
 
03:24:13.990 --> 03:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
would need to occur to do all that and
 
03:24:16.269 --> 03:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
and how we go about that uh this is
 
03:24:18.309 --> 03:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
really the first opportunity we've ever
 
03:24:20.349 --> 03:24:20.359 align:start position:0%
had actually to evil even come up and
 
03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
talk about this topic so uh we're a new
 
03:24:25.309 --> 03:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
group we're organized uh we have support
 
03:24:26.309 --> 03:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
in fact one of the things that was
 
03:24:28.189 --> 03:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
interesting when we had sort of an open
 
03:24:30.269 --> 03:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
house in the town of asby uh we did a
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
survey afterwards and
 
03:24:34.830 --> 03:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
76% of the the people who responded were
 
03:24:37.070 --> 03:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
total favor of the rail trail and the
 
03:24:39.590 --> 03:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
and the oedc has had Envision nights and
 
03:24:41.550 --> 03:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
this idea of a rail trail recreational
 
03:24:43.309 --> 03:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
Trail has been a very popular item but
 
03:24:45.070 --> 03:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
the ca factors that you're talking about
 
03:24:46.630 --> 03:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
I I just don't know the answer at at the
 
03:24:48.830 --> 03:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
moment I'm sorry if I could follow up oh
 
03:24:50.070 --> 03:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
yes please continue thank you Mr
 
03:24:52.790 --> 03:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
chairman uh so it's the rails the ties
 
03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
is there any other infrastructure in the
 
03:24:57.189 --> 03:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
way well there are some uh there's
 
03:24:58.990 --> 03:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
there's some prestel that cross some
 
03:25:01.269 --> 03:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
some waterways that would have to be
 
03:25:06.150 --> 03:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
analyzed and see if they're safe uh um
 
03:25:08.349 --> 03:25:08.359 align:start position:0%
yeah the total
 
03:25:11.990 --> 03:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
mileage well the total mileage is um if
 
03:25:13.950 --> 03:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
you start from the center of OIP where
 
03:25:15.710 --> 03:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
this project is and you go up to Route
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
41 it's about I think 9 10
 
03:25:22.510 --> 03:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
miles it it starts in Center rby crosses
 
03:25:25.229 --> 03:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
Route 16 and then goes up to towards
 
03:25:28.990 --> 03:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
Madison uh along Route 41 there thank
 
03:25:31.469 --> 03:25:31.479 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you uh further questions
 
03:25:32.710 --> 03:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
on Mr Elliott for members of the
 
03:25:35.830 --> 03:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh okay ref Farner please uh
 
03:25:38.550 --> 03:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of recreational users do you
 
03:25:38.560 --> 03:25:40.469 align:start position:0%
in terms of recreational users do you
anticipate

03:25:40.469 --> 03:25:40.479 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
03:25:40.479 --> 03:25:42.469 align:start position:0%
anticipate
um

03:25:42.469 --> 03:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:45.389 --> 03:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
uh you know Walkers bikes obviously but
 
03:25:47.910 --> 03:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh is there a difference terms of
 
03:25:50.550 --> 03:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
perception if we introduce snowmobiles
 
03:25:52.070 --> 03:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
and then on top of snowmobiles perhaps
 
03:25:53.790 --> 03:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles already use the trail other
 
03:25:56.150 --> 03:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
ATVs uh snowmobiles already use the
 
03:25:59.510 --> 03:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
trail ATVs do not and the whole question
 
03:26:01.510 --> 03:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
about ATVs is an interesting one because
 
03:26:03.150 --> 03:26:03.160 align:start position:0%
I think you discover throughout the
 
03:26:04.590 --> 03:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
country and I think even in the state of
 
03:26:06.389 --> 03:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that most of your
 
03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
recreational trails and uh bike trails
 
03:26:11.630 --> 03:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
are non-motorized they would not allow
 
03:26:13.229 --> 03:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
but they do allow the snowmobiles during
 
03:26:15.229 --> 03:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
the winter

b b okay whichever so it boost as far as
 
03:27:00.670 --> 03:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
as long as it checked that the bounce Mr
 
03:27:04.070 --> 03:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
chair um you know Chris and I have been
 
03:27:06.150 --> 03:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
working together on on this project and
 
03:27:07.990 --> 03:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
others and we thought in terms of the
 
03:27:09.990 --> 03:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm not going to go over the
 
03:27:12.110 --> 03:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
same ground that he he laid out there
 
03:27:14.229 --> 03:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
but to bring to you um from my
 
03:27:16.389 --> 03:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
perspective and my role as a director of
 
03:27:19.070 --> 03:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
the Chamber of Commerce and oopy and and
 
03:27:22.030 --> 03:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
a member of the FR Constitution Park
 
03:27:25.870 --> 03:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
those two entities um are supporting
 
03:27:28.870 --> 03:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
this effort because our vision as part
 
03:27:30.429 --> 03:27:30.439 align:start position:0%
of our
 
03:27:34.790 --> 03:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
um our mission is to enhance economic
 
03:27:37.189 --> 03:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
and recreational opportunities they go
 
03:27:40.349 --> 03:27:40.359 align:start position:0%
hand inand and we know that in that
 
03:27:43.110 --> 03:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
Corridor in Roots 16 there's a golden
 
03:27:45.429 --> 03:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
opportunity so we see a vision not only
 
03:27:49.030 --> 03:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
for a business uh increase but also for
 
03:27:51.469 --> 03:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
Community use I mean we see and I see
 
03:27:53.429 --> 03:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
the kids walking down the trail and
 
03:27:55.030 --> 03:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
running down the trail I just don't see
 
03:27:57.790 --> 03:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
railroad tracks there so how do we get
 
03:28:00.750 --> 03:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
there uh this bill is going to thanks to
 
03:28:03.389 --> 03:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
to rep rep Smith trying to bring this to
 
03:28:06.030 --> 03:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
a head and say what can we do or what
 
03:28:08.229 --> 03:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
can't we do because we've been kind of
 
03:28:10.030 --> 03:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
floundering uh and I'm not being
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
proagtive but just the way is and
 
03:28:13.349 --> 03:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
somebody has to make a decision what is
 
03:28:16.389 --> 03:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
the plan and can we fit in that plan I I
 
03:28:19.389 --> 03:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
would implore you to open that plan that
 
03:28:21.269 --> 03:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
we can work together collaboratively
 
03:28:23.150 --> 03:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
with whether groups are using it we've
 
03:28:26.710 --> 03:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
got to find some sense of we all can get
 
03:28:28.990 --> 03:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
the benefit out of that so with with
 
03:28:30.349 --> 03:28:30.359 align:start position:0%
that in mind I'll give you one other
 
03:28:33.590 --> 03:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
plug um my wife who's the chair of the
 
03:28:35.750 --> 03:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
of friends of uh Constitution Park
 
03:28:36.830 --> 03:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today because she's
 
03:28:38.670 --> 03:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
writing a grant that do at the end of
 
03:28:40.630 --> 03:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
the month and if I don't mention
 
03:28:42.110 --> 03:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
something about that I won't be able to
 
03:28:44.429 --> 03:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
go home so I just want to that she
 
03:28:45.750 --> 03:28:45.760 align:start position:0%

active actively used isra
 
03:29:06.030 --> 03:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
now I don't know if it's actively used
 
03:29:10.110 --> 03:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:12.710 --> 03:29:12.720 align:start position:0%

years to um maintain or upgrade those
 
03:29:21.750 --> 03:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
tracks I have no
 
03:29:21.760 --> 03:29:23.349 align:start position:0%
tracks I have no

testimony Dr boo I will next call upon
 
03:29:38.030 --> 03:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
Shelley Winters of New Hampshire dot who
 
03:29:41.550 --> 03:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
has indicated no position on the bill
 
03:29:42.990 --> 03:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
welcome back to Public Works and
 
03:29:46.510 --> 03:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:48.670 --> 03:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
Winters thank you so for the record my
 
03:29:50.630 --> 03:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
name is Shy Winters I'm the director of
 
03:29:52.269 --> 03:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
the division of Aeronautics Rail and
 
03:29:53.870 --> 03:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
Transit at the Department of
 
03:29:55.710 --> 03:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation here to provide some
 
03:29:57.710 --> 03:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
technical testimony maybe clarify some
 
03:29:59.429 --> 03:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
of the answers to questions that were
 
03:30:01.750 --> 03:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
asked relative to State investment and
 
03:30:03.590 --> 03:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
state usage and then answer any
 
03:30:06.630 --> 03:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
questions you may have so um just by way
 
03:30:09.070 --> 03:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
of a little bit of background the
 
03:30:10.510 --> 03:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
department and the state purchas this
 
03:30:13.150 --> 03:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
quarter and two phases purchased 8 miles
 
03:30:15.630 --> 03:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
in Madison to the Albany colway Town
 
03:30:18.469 --> 03:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
Line in 1995 using State funds which I
 
03:30:20.189 --> 03:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
believe were capital state appropriated
 
03:30:22.269 --> 03:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
Capital funds and then purchased 13
 
03:30:25.229 --> 03:30:25.239 align:start position:0%
miles in Tamworth and oopy in 2001 those
 
03:30:26.429 --> 03:30:26.439 align:start position:0%
were using Federal Highway
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
Transportation enhancement funds with
 
03:30:30.750 --> 03:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
state capital match so those
 
03:30:32.950 --> 03:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
Transportation enh enhancement funds on
 
03:30:35.429 --> 03:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
those 13 miles would preclude motorized
 
03:30:37.870 --> 03:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles such as ohvs but snowmobiles
 
03:30:40.110 --> 03:30:40.120 align:start position:0%
would be allowed so in total the state
 
03:30:42.590 --> 03:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
owns roughly 20 21 miles of state-owned
 
03:30:44.670 --> 03:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
Conway Branch it's situated in between
 
03:30:46.070 --> 03:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire North Coast the freight
 
03:30:48.389 --> 03:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
provider to the South as an abutter and
 
03:30:50.349 --> 03:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
Conway Scenic Railroad is the a butter
 
03:30:51.990 --> 03:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
to the north which we all know runs
 
03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
tourist Excursion
 
03:30:56.670 --> 03:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
service um we own the corridor but since
 
03:30:59.110 --> 03:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
2001 since our acquisition it has been
 
03:31:01.110 --> 03:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
managed by the trails Bureau at
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
03:31:03.750 --> 03:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
resources through a Cooperative
 
03:31:05.870 --> 03:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
agreement as the rail and ties are
 
03:31:08.590 --> 03:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
largely in place dncr has availed that
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
only for winter recreational use as is
 
03:31:13.070 --> 03:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
evidenced on their website due to safety
 
03:31:15.550 --> 03:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
concerns with trips and falls over ties
 
03:31:17.910 --> 03:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
and and rails so once they snow pack and
 
03:31:20.349 --> 03:31:20.359 align:start position:0%
snow cover all the normal gamut of
 
03:31:23.469 --> 03:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
recreational winter uses are availed by
 
03:31:27.229 --> 03:31:27.239 align:start position:0%
dncr 2019 the department distributed a
 
03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
request for interest on all uses of the
 
03:31:32.710 --> 03:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
line rail or other commercial or
 
03:31:36.150 --> 03:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
recreational um Trail uses we got two
 
03:31:38.229 --> 03:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
responses at that time and they were
 
03:31:41.189 --> 03:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
from a motor motorized railroad p putt
 
03:31:43.670 --> 03:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
cars so to speak and then rail biking we
 
03:31:46.349 --> 03:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
got no Trail interest at the time during
 
03:31:50.229 --> 03:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
that RFI time so since that time again
 
03:31:51.630 --> 03:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
covid and other things have taken
 
03:31:54.110 --> 03:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
priority we've been working on an RFP
 
03:31:57.950 --> 03:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
for on rail uses of the 21 miles I think
 
03:32:00.550 --> 03:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
the subject Amendment before you is only
 
03:32:03.030 --> 03:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
looking at a 15 mile segment of our 21
 
03:32:05.790 --> 03:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
miles of ownership so our RFP that we're
 
03:32:08.389 --> 03:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
working on and plan to release is for 21
 
03:32:11.910 --> 03:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
miles of on rail uses and that allows us
 
03:32:13.269 --> 03:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
to go through the Continuum of
 
03:32:17.030 --> 03:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation uses that connect and we
 
03:32:18.150 --> 03:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
understand there would need to be some
 
03:32:19.950 --> 03:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
significant financial investment to
 
03:32:22.229 --> 03:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
bring those up to certain on-rail uses
 
03:32:24.429 --> 03:32:24.439 align:start position:0%
but we're going down that Continuum of
 
03:32:27.349 --> 03:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
Transportation uses um at the end of the
 
03:32:29.429 --> 03:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
day through our process we may get no
 
03:32:31.790 --> 03:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
responses or no feasible responses that
 
03:32:33.750 --> 03:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
could be financially solvent which may
 
03:32:37.510 --> 03:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
lead us to the next um conversation
 
03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
about recreational uses we've been
 
03:32:42.309 --> 03:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
engaged with d NCR throughout the
 
03:32:44.429 --> 03:32:44.439 align:start position:0%
process receiving their feedback on our
 
03:32:47.150 --> 03:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
RFP and on our timeline I've talked to
 
03:32:48.990 --> 03:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
several of the um the gentlemen who have
 
03:32:51.429 --> 03:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
already testified about the ability
 
03:32:54.150 --> 03:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps for two uses to coexist if rail
 
03:32:56.030 --> 03:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
biking or other on-rail uses that are
 
03:32:59.510 --> 03:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
low speed um were selected to bring
 
03:33:01.830 --> 03:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
revenue and economy and tourism our
 
03:33:03.150 --> 03:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
RightWay may still be able to
 
03:33:05.910 --> 03:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
accommodate an on rail use and a trail
 
03:33:08.110 --> 03:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
use we just don't know until we get to
 
03:33:10.389 --> 03:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
the end of that process so um we're
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
planning to to forge ahead with that 21
 
03:33:16.950 --> 03:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
Mile RFP for our whole ownership we have
 
03:33:18.990 --> 03:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
been staff and resource constraint the
 
03:33:21.269 --> 03:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
rail Bureau is a general funded Bureau
 
03:33:24.670 --> 03:33:24.680 align:start position:0%
of the department we have one engineer
 
03:33:26.590 --> 03:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
responsible for all railroad lines in
 
03:33:29.150 --> 03:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
the state one railroad planner we have
 
03:33:31.269 --> 03:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
about 500 miles between abandoned
 
03:33:32.830 --> 03:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
corridors and active corridors that
 
03:33:35.830 --> 03:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
we're responsible for um we've got a a
 
03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
bureau administrator who's only 50%
 
03:33:40.870 --> 03:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
oversight of rail that was vacant for 9
 
03:33:42.630 --> 03:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
months that was my position and it will
 
03:33:45.349 --> 03:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
become vacant again uh Friday so we've
 
03:33:46.590 --> 03:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
had some constraints it's still
 
03:33:48.870 --> 03:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
something we're working on and uh but
 
03:33:50.469 --> 03:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know about that as
 
03:33:52.990 --> 03:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
well as we just hired a consultant and
 
03:33:55.309 --> 03:33:55.319 align:start position:0%
we're doing an update to our 2012 State
 
03:33:57.750 --> 03:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
rail plan and uh we'll be going through
 
03:33:59.510 --> 03:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
that over the next year and a half and
 
03:34:01.990 --> 03:34:02.000 align:start position:0%
part of that process we'll be looking at
 
03:34:04.429 --> 03:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
all privately owned and publicly owned
 
03:34:06.269 --> 03:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
State railroad quarters agnostic of
 
03:34:07.750 --> 03:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
their current use and looking at it from
 
03:34:10.510 --> 03:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
a network perspective trying to uh look
 
03:34:11.790 --> 03:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
at into the future and look at the
 
03:34:14.550 --> 03:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
long-term use and connectivity so we're
 
03:34:16.429 --> 03:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
looking at a framework to try to
 
03:34:19.750 --> 03:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
evaluate any um segments of railroad
 
03:34:21.469 --> 03:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
quarters that are currently out of
 
03:34:23.510 --> 03:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
service such as the Conway Branch so
 
03:34:25.030 --> 03:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
there's a history to it there's a lot
 
03:34:27.110 --> 03:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
going on we think we can work in
 
03:34:29.150 --> 03:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
parallel with the amendment but we're
 
03:34:31.349 --> 03:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
still planning at this point in time to
 
03:34:33.830 --> 03:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
to continue um with our RFP and with
 
03:34:35.309 --> 03:34:35.319 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to answer any questions
 
03:34:37.349 --> 03:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
you may have okay thank you Miss wers
 
03:34:38.710 --> 03:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
questions on Miss wers from members of
 
03:34:41.070 --> 03:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
the committee okay representative Newton
 
03:34:42.950 --> 03:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
followed by representative fauler thank
 
03:34:44.510 --> 03:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
03:34:47.429 --> 03:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
my question uh very good testimony very
 
03:34:50.790 --> 03:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
informative um I have a little concern
 
03:34:52.830 --> 03:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
about the trestles can you tell me what
 
03:34:54.590 --> 03:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
bodies of water they're over and do you
 
03:34:57.189 --> 03:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
see the trestles as a big hurdle for
 
03:35:00.550 --> 03:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
this to make them safe for people to go
 
03:35:04.429 --> 03:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
over so I can provide a list out a I
 
03:35:05.670 --> 03:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
don't know them all off the top of my
 
03:35:08.429 --> 03:35:08.439 align:start position:0%
head we do have a inventory of all those
 
03:35:11.870 --> 03:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
right now because dncr is the one who is
 
03:35:14.950 --> 03:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
managing the recreational use it's um
 
03:35:18.630 --> 03:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
depart Do's position that dncr evaluate
 
03:35:20.429 --> 03:35:20.439 align:start position:0%
those prior to opening them up for the
 
03:35:22.189 --> 03:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
season certainly depending on the type
 
03:35:24.550 --> 03:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
of use that this line is ultimately used
 
03:35:26.790 --> 03:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
for whether it's rail service rail
 
03:35:29.070 --> 03:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
biking or a trail that would be a
 
03:35:30.510 --> 03:35:30.520 align:start position:0%
Paramount safety concern and
 
03:35:32.150 --> 03:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
consideration that what other entity is
 
03:35:33.990 --> 03:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
going to be ultimately responsible for
 
03:35:35.990 --> 03:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
constructing and maintaining would want
 
03:35:38.150 --> 03:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
to do those evaluations to make sure
 
03:35:40.030 --> 03:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
that it can handle the loads and is safe
 
03:35:42.550 --> 03:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
for those um use type so we have not
 
03:35:44.269 --> 03:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
done inspections as of late because we
 
03:35:47.349 --> 03:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
do not as do use those right now thank
 
03:35:49.870 --> 03:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you rep I'm fauler please
 
03:35:52.030 --> 03:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I think you explained that
 
03:35:55.670 --> 03:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
dncr manages the recreational Trails uh
 
03:35:57.269 --> 03:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
can you describe what the relationship
 
03:36:00.510 --> 03:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
between dncr and the municipalities
 
03:36:03.309 --> 03:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
where current rail trails are and and
 
03:36:06.189 --> 03:36:06.199 align:start position:0%
even with private uh volunteer groups
 
03:36:09.150 --> 03:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
who help uh help maintain those
 
03:36:12.630 --> 03:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
Trails sure I believe and uh Craig reny
 
03:36:14.309 --> 03:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
from the trails bureau chief would
 
03:36:17.189 --> 03:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
probably be able to uh more eloquently
 
03:36:18.710 --> 03:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
state it but I I believe it's different
 
03:36:20.910 --> 03:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
quarter to quarter based on whether
 
03:36:23.269 --> 03:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
there's a year round use or it's a
 
03:36:25.229 --> 03:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
winter recreational use only in some
 
03:36:27.309 --> 03:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
instances they partner with the
 
03:36:29.070 --> 03:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
communities through which the trails
 
03:36:31.189 --> 03:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
they manage go through I know they
 
03:36:33.790 --> 03:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
establish agreements with many of those
 
03:36:35.630 --> 03:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities they have agreements with
 
03:36:38.150 --> 03:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
snowmobile clubs and and other
 
03:36:40.030 --> 03:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
recreational Trails clubs to assist them
 
03:36:42.389 --> 03:36:42.399 align:start position:0%
with maintenance so there are some um
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
responsibilities incumbent upon through
 
03:36:46.830 --> 03:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
those contracts I don't know uh in the
 
03:36:48.229 --> 03:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
Conway area what they have for
 
03:36:50.670 --> 03:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
formalized relationships I know if we
 
03:36:53.389 --> 03:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
get calls about an issue on the Conway
 
03:36:55.550 --> 03:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
branch in Winter use we do refer the
 
03:36:58.429 --> 03:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
caller or we ourselves reach out to dncr
 
03:37:00.189 --> 03:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
and they have a field staff person who's
 
03:37:02.670 --> 03:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for that Conway
 
03:37:05.550 --> 03:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
area okay thank you uh further questions
 
03:37:07.269 --> 03:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
on Miss Winters from members of the
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
committee are there any further
 
03:37:11.590 --> 03:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you very much M oh
 
03:37:12.630 --> 03:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
you do have
 
03:37:14.990 --> 03:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
something goad Mr chairman thanks for
 
03:37:17.750 --> 03:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
the question uh taking my question so on
 
03:37:19.550 --> 03:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
this Branch you're exploring every
 
03:37:22.469 --> 03:37:22.479 align:start position:0%
option the rail division is
 
03:37:26.070 --> 03:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
exploring every option through that
 
03:37:28.469 --> 03:37:28.479 align:start position:0%
segment through the RFP we're going to
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
be soliciting on rail uses only and then
 
03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
see if those on rail uses if they're
 
03:37:37.950 --> 03:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
viable do they also support um a trail
 
03:37:40.110 --> 03:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
option within our right of way because
 
03:37:43.710 --> 03:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
we a wi of right way through there but
 
03:37:46.349 --> 03:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank Youk okay thank you again any
 
03:37:47.990 --> 03:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
further questions yes go ahead referent
 
03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:50.590 align:start position:0%
further questions yes go ahead referent
Boger

03:37:50.590 --> 03:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:53.550 --> 03:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
please I'm from the uh Lakes Region and
 
03:37:56.349 --> 03:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
we have a trail we call it the wild
 
03:37:58.590 --> 03:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
trail that goes alongside the railroad
 
03:38:01.110 --> 03:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
tracks and a lot of places we're
 
03:38:04.750 --> 03:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
required to put fence lines and stuff in
 
03:38:08.070 --> 03:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
so that we can partner with it and the
 
03:38:12.309 --> 03:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
question I have is in this situation
 
03:38:14.469 --> 03:38:14.479 align:start position:0%
where it's
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
not an active rail line but you want to
 
03:38:21.070 --> 03:38:21.080 align:start position:0%
keep the rails in place would the
 
03:38:23.830 --> 03:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
similar situation be required to put a
 
03:38:30.790 --> 03:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
fence line in between the non-rain used
 
03:38:35.150 --> 03:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
railroad tracks in the trail beside it
 
03:38:38.590 --> 03:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
if that's the one of the options that is
 
03:38:41.150 --> 03:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
made I think until we know what the on
 
03:38:43.429 --> 03:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
rail uses are and which ones if any are
 
03:38:44.950 --> 03:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
viable that we would enter into a
 
03:38:46.510 --> 03:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
contract that would go through Governor
 
03:38:48.550 --> 03:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
Council it's hard to tell if if it were
 
03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
certainly if it were a freight railroad
 
03:38:49.840 --> 03:38:50.790 align:start position:0%
certainly if it were a freight railroad
coming

03:38:50.790 --> 03:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
coming
 
03:38:53.550 --> 03:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
through the offsets would be much more
 
03:38:55.710 --> 03:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
stringent and how far off the center
 
03:38:58.429 --> 03:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
line and the fening if through the RFP
 
03:39:00.670 --> 03:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
process let's just say for conversation
 
03:39:02.349 --> 03:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
sake it was a rail biking which we know
 
03:39:05.950 --> 03:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
is a is very low speed and and low risk
 
03:39:07.990 --> 03:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's likely that we may just require a
 
03:39:09.830 --> 03:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
certain physical offset without having
 
03:39:11.550 --> 03:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
to have fence between it it really
 
03:39:14.269 --> 03:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
depends on if any on rail uses are
 
03:39:16.790 --> 03:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
selected and what is selected what is
 
03:39:18.830 --> 03:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
the speed and what is the potential for
 
03:39:21.110 --> 03:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
that on rail use to come off the the
 
03:39:23.670 --> 03:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
tracks and have any kind of interaction
 
03:39:27.750 --> 03:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
with with the trail so um follow up okay
 
03:39:29.550 --> 03:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up please continue represent
 
03:39:32.349 --> 03:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
now the uh bridges that are transverse
 
03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
into waterways and stuff um are they
 
03:39:41.550 --> 03:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
able to to handle a train currently
 
03:39:43.070 --> 03:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
so certainly they would all need to be
 
03:39:45.150 --> 03:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
expected they'd all need to be inspected
 
03:39:46.910 --> 03:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
again they'd all need to be um load
 
03:39:49.030 --> 03:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
rated when the department acquired that
 
03:39:50.870 --> 03:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
quarter I don't believe they we got a
 
03:39:53.349 --> 03:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
full set of the load rating and the
 
03:39:55.630 --> 03:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
bridge information so that is certainly
 
03:39:57.389 --> 03:39:57.399 align:start position:0%
something that a respondent would need
 
03:39:59.269 --> 03:39:59.279 align:start position:0%
to take into mind if they respond to the
 
03:40:02.070 --> 03:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
on rail RFP so go out and and look at
 
03:40:04.269 --> 03:40:04.279 align:start position:0%
that and figure that into their cost
 
03:40:06.429 --> 03:40:06.439 align:start position:0%
calculations and we wouldn't sign off on
 
03:40:08.510 --> 03:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
the operation of any on rail service
 
03:40:10.910 --> 03:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
until uh the department was satisfied
 
03:40:12.830 --> 03:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
that that was going to be done safely so
 
03:40:14.150 --> 03:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
it would need to be done in the future
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
by an by an entity if they wanted to
 
03:40:18.150 --> 03:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
start rail service further question
 
03:40:22.910 --> 03:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
please continue now based on the the
 
03:40:25.990 --> 03:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
bill with the amendment and stuff before
 
03:40:31.229 --> 03:40:31.239 align:start position:0%
us um these same bridges are usually not
 
03:40:33.389 --> 03:40:33.399 align:start position:0%
designed for foot
 
03:40:37.710 --> 03:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
traffic but an on rail bike system would
 
03:40:40.670 --> 03:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
would wouldn't hamper the bridge
 
03:40:45.469 --> 03:40:45.479 align:start position:0%
use uh I don't I don't see it but so my
 
03:40:48.910 --> 03:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
question would be is if it's allowed to
 
03:40:55.070 --> 03:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
Bridges who would be the plan or what is
 
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
the plan to pay for such changes to
 
03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
these bridges that would have to take
 
03:41:07.070 --> 03:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
place in order for foot traffic to
 
03:41:09.630 --> 03:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
happen yeah pun intend but we'd have to
 
03:41:11.229 --> 03:41:11.239 align:start position:0%
cross that bridge when we get there
 
03:41:15.070 --> 03:41:15.080 align:start position:0%
again and until we know um where these
 
03:41:16.830 --> 03:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
theoretical rail bikes would want to go
 
03:41:18.670 --> 03:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
I think many of them may try to avoid
 
03:41:20.429 --> 03:41:20.439 align:start position:0%
atg grade Crossings and as many bridges
 
03:41:22.550 --> 03:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
as they can to minimize their their cost
 
03:41:25.469 --> 03:41:25.479 align:start position:0%
certainly if we could have two uses
 
03:41:27.309 --> 03:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
theoretical rail bike and a trail
 
03:41:29.429 --> 03:41:29.439 align:start position:0%
coexist um we'd have to look at that
 
03:41:31.510 --> 03:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
bridge and we'd have to look at the the
 
03:41:34.750 --> 03:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
use um how many days a week and and when
 
03:41:36.950 --> 03:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
the rail bikes would be used to see if
 
03:41:38.149 --> 03:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
there could be a way that the trail
 
03:41:40.189 --> 03:41:40.199 align:start position:0%
comes back onto that bridge and and
 
03:41:41.990 --> 03:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
obviously Trail users would have to
 
03:41:44.070 --> 03:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
yield to the through traffic or whether
 
03:41:46.429 --> 03:41:46.439 align:start position:0%
or not the bridges themselves could have
 
03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
let's call a a small Trail can levered
 
03:41:50.269 --> 03:41:50.279 align:start position:0%
off the side of there or build a small
 
03:41:51.830 --> 03:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
Bridge some of these are you know
 
03:41:54.550 --> 03:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
streams and lower volume waterways but
 
03:41:56.149 --> 03:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
again until we know what the uses are
 
03:41:58.269 --> 03:41:58.279 align:start position:0%
and we know the speed and the frequency
 
03:42:00.189 --> 03:42:00.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's hard to to come up with that I
 
03:42:02.990 --> 03:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
will say overall um the department does
 
03:42:04.469 --> 03:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
not directly through the Bureau of rail
 
03:42:06.189 --> 03:42:06.199 align:start position:0%
and Transit fund any of the trail
 
03:42:08.670 --> 03:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
construction it's usually incumbent upon
 
03:42:10.510 --> 03:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
um the trail advocates so the
 
03:42:14.189 --> 03:42:14.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities or dncr to um find Grant
 
03:42:16.950 --> 03:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
funds and and local match funds to help
 
03:42:19.630 --> 03:42:19.640 align:start position:0%
with the construction and the Perpetual
 
03:42:22.030 --> 03:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance of those corridors okay
 
03:42:23.590 --> 03:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions thank you
 
03:42:25.670 --> 03:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
represent bogar further any oh yes
 
03:42:28.229 --> 03:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
represent Adar please oh thank you Mr
 
03:42:30.510 --> 03:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my
 
03:42:32.790 --> 03:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
question I was wondering and I might
 
03:42:34.469 --> 03:42:34.479 align:start position:0%
have been looking at all this paperwork
 
03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh so hopefully haven't already answered
 
03:42:39.750 --> 03:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
this question but uh relative to your
 
03:42:41.590 --> 03:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
your saying you don't have an RFP out
 
03:42:43.229 --> 03:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
you there other studies or whatever that
 
03:42:47.229 --> 03:42:47.239 align:start position:0%
are being done um and also knowing that
 
03:42:49.309 --> 03:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
some of the trails I've been on is that
 
03:42:51.070 --> 03:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
there is just the rail bed there's just
 
03:42:53.149 --> 03:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
the rails and there's not like roads
 
03:42:55.309 --> 03:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
next to them some have a service road
 
03:42:59.229 --> 03:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
some don't but um when would you know
 
03:43:01.590 --> 03:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
from this review that's being done if in
 
03:43:03.710 --> 03:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
fact it would be acceptable to take
 
03:43:05.710 --> 03:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
right at this time to take out the the
 
03:43:07.189 --> 03:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
rails and the
 
03:43:10.389 --> 03:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
ties so I and it's a lot of predicated
 
03:43:11.750 --> 03:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question R Edgar I
 
03:43:13.750 --> 03:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
think it's predicated on when we put the
 
03:43:16.189 --> 03:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
RFP out um one of the things that we
 
03:43:17.429 --> 03:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
think is very important for any
 
03:43:19.389 --> 03:43:19.399 align:start position:0%
potential respondent because this has
 
03:43:21.349 --> 03:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
been dormant or just winter use for some
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
time is letting the snow melt and
 
03:43:25.269 --> 03:43:25.279 align:start position:0%
letting potential respondents see the
 
03:43:26.269 --> 03:43:26.279 align:start position:0%
condition so they can look at the
 
03:43:27.750 --> 03:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
bridges they can look at the drainage
 
03:43:29.670 --> 03:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
and they can try to
 
03:43:32.510 --> 03:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
um better estimate what their
 
03:43:34.269 --> 03:43:34.279 align:start position:0%
construction their all-in cost would be
 
03:43:35.830 --> 03:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
so I think we're hoping we've got it
 
03:43:37.630 --> 03:43:37.640 align:start position:0%
pretty much ready ready to go out but we
 
03:43:39.870 --> 03:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
need to hold it to allow a twoe period
 
03:43:41.630 --> 03:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
so that respondents can go look at the
 
03:43:43.189 --> 03:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
quarter to come up with their financial
 
03:43:45.229 --> 03:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
plan and then submit to us so I'm
 
03:43:46.590 --> 03:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
thinking sometime by the end of this
 
03:43:48.630 --> 03:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year the department could
 
03:43:50.950 --> 03:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
be through the process where we've
 
03:43:54.269 --> 03:43:54.279 align:start position:0%
received um proposals and Whitted it
 
03:43:55.990 --> 03:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
down to whether you know whether there's
 
03:43:58.630 --> 03:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
any Financial viability and return on
 
03:44:01.149 --> 03:44:01.159 align:start position:0%
investment for the state so that's why I
 
03:44:02.950 --> 03:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
I kind of said I think in tandem these
 
03:44:04.750 --> 03:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
could work knowing the timing of when
 
03:44:07.830 --> 03:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
this may actually um be in place we as
 
03:44:10.269 --> 03:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
the department may be better able to
 
03:44:12.870 --> 03:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
come to the table with the results of
 
03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
our RFP or at least the early results
 
03:44:17.429 --> 03:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
that let us start the discussion of
 
03:44:19.710 --> 03:44:19.720 align:start position:0%
whether there's a coexistent of multiple
 
03:44:22.469 --> 03:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
uses or whether we have no viable uses
 
03:44:25.149 --> 03:44:25.159 align:start position:0%
and we now just start talking um pure
 
03:44:27.950 --> 03:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
recreational and and Trail based use
 
03:44:29.710 --> 03:44:29.720 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you further
 
03:44:31.189 --> 03:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
questions of Miss Winters from members
 
03:44:34.469 --> 03:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
of the committee further questions I see
 
03:44:35.910 --> 03:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much for answering
 
03:44:38.750 --> 03:44:38.760 align:start position:0%

representative Mark mccon in favor of
the

03:44:57.349 --> 03:44:57.359 align:start position:0%

um
 
03:45:13.389 --> 03:45:13.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment um and I'm also a
 
03:45:15.710 --> 03:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor um I would like
 
03:45:18.349 --> 03:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
to give a little more background of
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
where we are with this the the uh Conway
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
branch of the rail which is inactive is
 
03:45:32.389 --> 03:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
at least a 20 mile length all this all
 
03:45:34.710 --> 03:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
this that that we're proposing to use
 
03:45:38.189 --> 03:45:38.199 align:start position:0%
here is a 9 to a 10 Mile Stretch that
 
03:45:40.590 --> 03:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
stretch starts at an old Freight station
 
03:45:40.600 --> 03:45:41.510 align:start position:0%
stretch starts at an old Freight station
in

03:45:41.510 --> 03:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:45:45.269 --> 03:45:45.279 align:start position:0%
oy um and runs to the
 
03:45:47.990 --> 03:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
reconstructed uh train station at Silver
 
03:45:50.510 --> 03:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
Lake in Madison it's the only section
 
03:45:53.349 --> 03:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
that we're we're looking to deal with uh
 
03:45:56.269 --> 03:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
there there was a there still is a train
 
03:46:00.830 --> 03:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
station in Tam in U in West oopy and
 
03:46:03.429 --> 03:46:03.439 align:start position:0%
this is part of the famous ski train
 
03:46:05.830 --> 03:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
that ran a number of years and then
 
03:46:07.670 --> 03:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
there was some little bit of freight
 
03:46:09.309 --> 03:46:09.319 align:start position:0%
activity and then there's been nothing
 
03:46:12.630 --> 03:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
from that point on I uh resided and
 
03:46:14.790 --> 03:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
raised my family in the town of oy I
 
03:46:16.590 --> 03:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
should back up I represent the good
 
03:46:19.830 --> 03:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
people of uh District 8 in Carrol county
 
03:46:23.750 --> 03:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
oopy is not one of my uh my towns I did
 
03:46:26.830 --> 03:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
represent him early on in
 
03:46:29.590 --> 03:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
2000s uh I raised my family there my
 
03:46:31.269 --> 03:46:31.279 align:start position:0%
heart is in that
 
03:46:31.279 --> 03:46:33.110 align:start position:0%
heart is in that
town

03:46:33.110 --> 03:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
town
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
the so we're only talking about a 10
 
03:46:37.950 --> 03:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
Mile Stretch when the bill first came
 
03:46:41.990 --> 03:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
out and it went to uh OS to look at it
 
03:46:45.630 --> 03:46:45.640 align:start position:0%
it came back with a recommendation of a
 
03:46:47.950 --> 03:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
$200,000 master
 
03:46:50.189 --> 03:46:50.199 align:start position:0%
plan I know there are some members of
 
03:46:52.030 --> 03:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
this committee don't like to see numbers
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
like that in spent and it's a hindrance
 
03:46:58.670 --> 03:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
in the process this is real simple the
 
03:47:01.469 --> 03:47:01.479 align:start position:0%
town of oopy has been asking for five
 
03:47:05.189 --> 03:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
years or more to let the citizens walk
 
03:47:08.349 --> 03:47:08.359 align:start position:0%
on this section of rail and the
 
03:47:11.590 --> 03:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
department has said no you cannot we we
 
03:47:14.910 --> 03:47:14.920 align:start position:0%
will not permit that we will not avoid
 
03:47:17.750 --> 03:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
liability or provide liability for that
 
03:47:21.309 --> 03:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
section but don't worry folks we've got
 
03:47:25.149 --> 03:47:25.159 align:start position:0%
an RFP coming out and that RFP has been
 
03:47:28.269 --> 03:47:28.279 align:start position:0%
in the wind for over five years and that
 
03:47:32.309 --> 03:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
RFP is still being talked about
 
03:47:37.550 --> 03:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
today the we removed or Mr Smith
 
03:47:40.229 --> 03:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
removed um the original Bill and brought
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
it back to talking about uh instead of a
 
03:47:43.840 --> 03:47:44.910 align:start position:0%
it back to talking about uh instead of a
master

03:47:44.910 --> 03:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
master
 
03:47:48.309 --> 03:47:48.319 align:start position:0%

Transportation of rail the Bureau of

Northeast uh New Hampshire North Coast
 
03:48:08.670 --> 03:48:08.680 align:start position:0%
railroad to formulate a plan for the
 
03:48:12.189 --> 03:48:12.199 align:start position:0%
Public's best use of this section of
 
03:48:15.110 --> 03:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
rail the rail this the rail would
 
03:48:18.070 --> 03:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
explore the costs and income we will
 
03:48:20.710 --> 03:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
look at what it costs to remove the
 
03:48:24.229 --> 03:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
rails and take this down to a flat
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
surface there is no money being asked
 
03:48:28.950 --> 03:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
from the state of New Hampshire from
 
03:48:31.429 --> 03:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
this purpose there is no money being
 
03:48:33.990 --> 03:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
requested from the rails division it's
 
03:48:36.469 --> 03:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
just part of the study that what would
 
03:48:38.670 --> 03:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
it take to get this down to a flat
 
03:48:38.680 --> 03:48:40.189 align:start position:0%
it take to get this down to a flat
surface

03:48:40.189 --> 03:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
surface
 
03:48:42.309 --> 03:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
from my conversations with the rail
 
03:48:46.269 --> 03:48:46.279 align:start position:0%
Division and and many others that the
 
03:48:50.429 --> 03:48:50.439 align:start position:0%
the gauge of um or weight of this rail
 
03:48:52.469 --> 03:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
that's sitting there right now is not
 
03:48:55.469 --> 03:48:55.479 align:start position:0%
adequate enough even to carry Freight
 
03:48:58.710 --> 03:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
now there's no possibility that rail
 
03:49:01.149 --> 03:49:01.159 align:start position:0%
could ever come through excuse me
 
03:49:02.910 --> 03:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
passenger traffic could ever come
 
03:49:05.429 --> 03:49:05.439 align:start position:0%
through here because again of the of the
 
03:49:08.950 --> 03:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
degraded rail so whatever happens in the
 
03:49:08.960 --> 03:49:09.830 align:start position:0%
degraded rail so whatever happens in the
future

03:49:09.830 --> 03:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
future
 
03:49:13.990 --> 03:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
and this group knows full well as I know
 
03:49:17.469 --> 03:49:17.479 align:start position:0%
full well if 20 years from now that um
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
rail makes sense to come through there
 
03:49:22.750 --> 03:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
this trail goes away there'll be no
 
03:49:24.590 --> 03:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
commitment for the railroad to build a
 
03:49:27.590 --> 03:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
new Trail alongside it I don't think
 
03:49:29.830 --> 03:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to see this in my lifespan
 
03:49:32.269 --> 03:49:32.279 align:start position:0%
that that ever happens so why not let
 
03:49:36.389 --> 03:49:36.399 align:start position:0%
the residents use that section of rail
 
03:49:39.030 --> 03:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
um for whatever purpose it might be and
 
03:49:41.670 --> 03:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
they'll be in full conversation with the
 
03:49:44.510 --> 03:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
rail division the most active use of
 
03:49:47.630 --> 03:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
this property right now is snowmobiling
 
03:49:51.670 --> 03:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
Corridor 19 and it is a tremendous Boom
 
03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
for business owners on or anywhere
 
03:49:57.830 --> 03:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
near when there's plenty of snow and I
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
haven't seen that probably in 10 or 15
 
03:50:03.110 --> 03:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
years and it's stacked up over the rails
 
03:50:04.990 --> 03:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
it's easy to groom and there's not an
 
03:50:08.550 --> 03:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
issue we tend not to see snow now until
 
03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
February and by March things cool off or
 
03:50:14.349 --> 03:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
excuse me warm up and it's gone again so
 
03:50:16.189 --> 03:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
whatever limited time we had for
 
03:50:18.670 --> 03:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles is greatly hampered because
 
03:50:21.110 --> 03:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
as soon as you get your your I'm not a
 
03:50:23.389 --> 03:50:23.399 align:start position:0%
snowmobile but you get your Runners down
 
03:50:25.389 --> 03:50:25.399 align:start position:0%
into that and especially at the
 
03:50:28.070 --> 03:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
intersections and The Crossings uh it
 
03:50:30.750 --> 03:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
becomes extremely hazardous so I believe
 
03:50:32.990 --> 03:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
there there is a letter in your packet
 
03:50:35.870 --> 03:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
that talks about the rail division uh
 
03:50:38.149 --> 03:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
with great interest to wanting wanting
 
03:50:40.309 --> 03:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
to see this solution to
 
03:50:44.309 --> 03:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
happen um there is no continuous the
 
03:50:46.550 --> 03:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
when you leave molten bille Road in
 
03:50:48.309 --> 03:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
moltonville Road in
 
03:50:51.149 --> 03:50:51.159 align:start position:0%
Centos the the the rail is paved over
 
03:50:53.070 --> 03:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
there's no way to cross from one side to
 
03:50:56.070 --> 03:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
the other when they get down to Route 16
 
03:50:58.349 --> 03:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing again the rail is
 
03:51:01.469 --> 03:51:01.479 align:start position:0%
covered by there and when you get to 41
 
03:51:03.590 --> 03:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
why do we choose that section and only
 
03:51:08.110 --> 03:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
that section ahead of CER oopy the uh
 
03:51:10.229 --> 03:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for not saying the right
 
03:51:12.030 --> 03:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
name of the group out of wolfboro the
 
03:51:14.790 --> 03:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
putt putt group that travels and they
 
03:51:17.710 --> 03:51:17.720 align:start position:0%
have a successful Club they tend to only
 
03:51:21.309 --> 03:51:21.319 align:start position:0%
ride down to CER oopy we don't want to
 
03:51:23.429 --> 03:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
infringe with with their what they're
 
03:51:25.590 --> 03:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
doing it's very limited that they will
 
03:51:27.790 --> 03:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
ever cross over and go to the next
 
03:51:30.630 --> 03:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
section the U there's a gentleman I
 
03:51:32.990 --> 03:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
apologize for not knowing Hank's last
 
03:51:37.670 --> 03:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
name um he had he tried to get an RFP
 
03:51:39.469 --> 03:51:39.479 align:start position:0%
executive counselor Kenny which which is
 
03:51:41.670 --> 03:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
why he's on this tried to get the
 
03:51:44.110 --> 03:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
division to give them at least a
 
03:51:47.309 --> 03:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
one-year trial he wanted to go from
 
03:51:50.429 --> 03:51:50.439 align:start position:0%
where the pavement is in Silver Lake in
 
03:51:53.710 --> 03:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
front of the um train station and he
 
03:51:57.830 --> 03:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to go North to where um to where
 
03:52:01.110 --> 03:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
the the rail is blocked now in
 
03:52:04.030 --> 03:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
Madison and for well over a year whether
 
03:52:05.910 --> 03:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
he did it correct or
 
03:52:08.469 --> 03:52:08.479 align:start position:0%
incorrect an RFP couldn't be brought
 
03:52:08.479 --> 03:52:09.790 align:start position:0%
incorrect an RFP couldn't be brought
forward

03:52:09.790 --> 03:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:52:12.630 --> 03:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
and or a decision by the department that
 
03:52:15.269 --> 03:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
would allow him to run taking full
 
03:52:18.990 --> 03:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:22.149 --> 03:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
liability Freight moves
 
03:52:25.510 --> 03:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
slow the people of oy have no reason to
 
03:52:28.030 --> 03:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
have to wait for this repeatedly I I
 
03:52:30.670 --> 03:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
hear the story we've heard it today I
 
03:52:32.189 --> 03:52:32.199 align:start position:0%
don't have enough
 
03:52:34.910 --> 03:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
people uh we're going to get to it I
 
03:52:37.030 --> 03:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
think this is a nice
 
03:52:39.710 --> 03:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
solution uh no cost
 
03:52:42.990 --> 03:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
we pull this group together and we we
 
03:52:46.389 --> 03:52:46.399 align:start position:0%
explore all of those items the map for
 
03:52:50.189 --> 03:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
this 10 m section is shown here and I
 
03:52:52.510 --> 03:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
have a response to a few things
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
represent B ask for this an active Trail
 
03:52:58.389 --> 03:52:58.399 align:start position:0%
it is not uh kazinski represent kazinski
 
03:53:00.750 --> 03:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
had talked about how much money has been
 
03:53:04.670 --> 03:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
spent on um on this section of the rail
 
03:53:07.189 --> 03:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
the the my the best of my understanding
 
03:53:09.349 --> 03:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
the only the only division that spent
 
03:53:11.670 --> 03:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
money here is the trails
 
03:53:15.950 --> 03:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
Bureau uh Trails Bureau thank you sir um
 
03:53:17.870 --> 03:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
on their money for maintaining for the
 
03:53:19.790 --> 03:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles and the put putt group I
 
03:53:22.590 --> 03:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
will say has been a active participant
 
03:53:27.110 --> 03:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
in providing u u transportation for that
 
03:53:29.630 --> 03:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
for representative Newton the Trussel
 
03:53:33.309 --> 03:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
that are there they they uh have been
 
03:53:36.349 --> 03:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
upgraded and U for the purpose of
 
03:53:39.070 --> 03:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
snowmobile travel over them and the the
 
03:53:41.269 --> 03:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
two that I can think of the most have
 
03:53:44.389 --> 03:53:44.399 align:start position:0%
wooden railings provided on the side if
 
03:53:47.269 --> 03:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
it turned out the best use after this
 
03:53:50.189 --> 03:53:50.199 align:start position:0%
working group were to come was Rails to
 
03:53:53.309 --> 03:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
Trails I will not support the state
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
paying for that that'll be a private
 
03:53:58.389 --> 03:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
fundraising Venture and whatever they
 
03:54:01.229 --> 03:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
would need to make it safe for that for
 
03:54:03.870 --> 03:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
that purpose to happen uh they will be
 
03:54:06.550 --> 03:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
03:54:10.070 --> 03:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
that uh I finish up on on the U the
 
03:54:13.349 --> 03:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
bikee rail section Hank Hank's purpose
 
03:54:15.309 --> 03:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
was not to go
 
03:54:18.990 --> 03:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
forward um to the section of of rail
 
03:54:22.030 --> 03:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about it's a gorgeous
 
03:54:24.630 --> 03:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
walk it's in the woods it's along
 
03:54:27.149 --> 03:54:27.159 align:start position:0%
Wetlands uh there's not much chance at
 
03:54:29.750 --> 03:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
all of veering off very few places to
 
03:54:33.229 --> 03:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
put a side by-side Trail um the the
 
03:54:36.309 --> 03:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
choice is to be as inclusive as possible
 
03:54:38.990 --> 03:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
and unlike the representatives rail in
 
03:54:43.429 --> 03:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
Trail hugely successful program in lonia
 
03:54:45.229 --> 03:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
connecting with other Trails Tilton and
 
03:54:47.830 --> 03:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere else there is no active rail
 
03:54:49.269 --> 03:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
here and there won't be a need for
 
03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
someone to pay for uh to pay for fencing
 
03:54:57.030 --> 03:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
there I would be um I would be happy to
 
03:54:59.189 --> 03:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
take any questions okay thank you
 
03:55:00.630 --> 03:55:00.640 align:start position:0%

chairman and thank you for appearing uh
 
03:55:08.189 --> 03:55:08.199 align:start position:0%
is it your vision that the state would
 
03:55:11.590 --> 03:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
continue to own the ra the uh rway yes
 
03:55:11.600 --> 03:55:12.750 align:start position:0%
continue to own the ra the uh rway yes
they

03:55:12.750 --> 03:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:55:16.110 --> 03:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
will and and if if I could and only if
 
03:55:18.670 --> 03:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
rail were to return does the does the
 
03:55:21.309 --> 03:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
rail bed then go back for a rail
 
03:55:23.429 --> 03:55:23.439 align:start position:0%
purpose all right thank you further
 
03:55:26.030 --> 03:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative fauler
 
03:55:28.670 --> 03:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
please do we know whether the uh the
 
03:55:31.030 --> 03:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
rail and less likely the ties have
 
03:55:33.670 --> 03:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
salvage value which might decrease the
 
03:55:36.389 --> 03:55:36.399 align:start position:0%
cost of uh removing
 
03:55:38.670 --> 03:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
them thank thank you representative and
 
03:55:42.110 --> 03:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
I and I appreciate the uh the question
 
03:55:44.349 --> 03:55:44.359 align:start position:0%
uh part of part of the amendment talks
 
03:55:46.030 --> 03:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
about explore funding Any Trail
 
03:55:48.349 --> 03:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
improvements through private donations
 
03:55:51.830 --> 03:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
grants or the sale of the existing steel
 
03:55:54.309 --> 03:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
rails um I believe there'll be someone
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
speaking after we're of the opinion that
 
03:55:59.910 --> 03:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
of course there is a value for that um
 
03:56:02.469 --> 03:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
we're of the opinion that not every tie
 
03:56:04.630 --> 03:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
has to be removed to get to that level
 
03:56:06.910 --> 03:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
space because there's quite a few places
 
03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
here that the senders are gone and we're
 
03:56:11.189 --> 03:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
down to gr to grade already but yes it
 
03:56:12.630 --> 03:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
is a
 
03:56:14.389 --> 03:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you uh
 
03:56:16.110 --> 03:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
representative Newton Police Follow by
 
03:56:18.670 --> 03:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
RM jurors thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:56:21.550 --> 03:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I've
 
03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
got a I'm
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
wondering and you're from that area and
 
03:56:28.630 --> 03:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to figure out how to
 
03:56:32.110 --> 03:56:32.120 align:start position:0%
phrase it best is it better to have a
 
03:56:33.870 --> 03:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
trail system through there where people
 
03:56:36.670 --> 03:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
can go through and kind of Steward it
 
03:56:39.269 --> 03:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
and keep an eye on what's going on
 
03:56:43.229 --> 03:56:43.239 align:start position:0%
or is it better to leave the train rails
 
03:56:45.630 --> 03:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
vacant and will that lead to
 
03:56:47.630 --> 03:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
deterioration and people going in and
 
03:56:50.110 --> 03:56:50.120 align:start position:0%
dumping things in those areas is it just
 
03:56:51.429 --> 03:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that it's more
 
03:56:53.309 --> 03:56:53.319 align:start position:0%
beneficial to have a trail through that
 
03:56:55.670 --> 03:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
system am I correct with that I I would
 
03:56:58.429 --> 03:56:58.439 align:start position:0%
agree with the representative's position
 
03:57:00.149 --> 03:57:00.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you represent jurist
 
03:57:02.710 --> 03:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman the
 
03:57:05.469 --> 03:57:05.479 align:start position:0%
representative has the group come up
 
03:57:06.710 --> 03:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
with an estimate of what it would take
 
03:57:09.389 --> 03:57:09.399 align:start position:0%
to remove the rails in the time
 
03:57:12.309 --> 03:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
and any other environmental
 
03:57:15.830 --> 03:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh mitigation that could be possible
 
03:57:18.910 --> 03:57:18.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question um
 
03:57:21.429 --> 03:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
the uh working group uh excuse me I'm
 
03:57:24.990 --> 03:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
not the the group um that spoke earlier
 
03:57:27.670 --> 03:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
has not come to that has done that
 
03:57:29.590 --> 03:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
exploration I know there has been
 
03:57:32.389 --> 03:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
conversation with the Rails to Trails
 
03:57:35.429 --> 03:57:35.439 align:start position:0%
group National Group on on estimated
 
03:57:38.990 --> 03:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
cost but the problem is it's it's hard
 
03:57:41.110 --> 03:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
to generate that interest to come up
 
03:57:44.189 --> 03:57:44.199 align:start position:0%
with those numbers if you if you don't
 
03:57:46.189 --> 03:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
know if you're going to get the right to
 
03:57:49.389 --> 03:57:49.399 align:start position:0%
use it and the rails division piece has
 
03:57:51.389 --> 03:57:51.399 align:start position:0%
been or what they've been saying is we
 
03:57:54.910 --> 03:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
need to consider everything and anything
 
03:57:54.920 --> 03:57:56.229 align:start position:0%
need to consider everything and anything
and

03:57:56.229 --> 03:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:57:59.550 --> 03:57:59.560 align:start position:0%
um so that has not been done but that
 
03:58:01.630 --> 03:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
that will be after the after this
 
03:58:04.189 --> 03:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
working group is formed and reports by
 
03:58:06.910 --> 03:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
the end of next year uh then it will be
 
03:58:09.030 --> 03:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of that group that
 
03:58:11.910 --> 03:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
wants to come forward thank you okay
 
03:58:13.309 --> 03:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions of
 
03:58:14.790 --> 03:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative makoni from members of
 
03:58:16.309 --> 03:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
the committee all right yes
 
03:58:18.189 --> 03:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
representative mils yes just one uh
 
03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and question for Mr
 
03:58:23.309 --> 03:58:23.319 align:start position:0%
chair I understand your your group is
 
03:58:26.469 --> 03:58:26.479 align:start position:0%
just mainly interested in this 10
 
03:58:29.550 --> 03:58:29.560 align:start position:0%
certain mile area would it would they be
 
03:58:31.070 --> 03:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
interested or would it be any
 
03:58:33.510 --> 03:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
feasibility to it for them to be
 
03:58:37.269 --> 03:58:37.279 align:start position:0%
involved in this entire RFP project or
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
would there be no interest in that for
 
03:58:42.950 --> 03:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
your group thank you for the question um
 
03:58:45.030 --> 03:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
I have I have always found that it's
 
03:58:47.710 --> 03:58:47.720 align:start position:0%
better to start with small bites and you
 
03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
know get something working and then move
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
from there the conversation gets very
 
03:58:56.229 --> 03:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
complicated when you take this all the
 
03:58:58.149 --> 03:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
way to Conway because there's a diverse
 
03:59:00.469 --> 03:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
a different group of uh people and
 
03:59:03.630 --> 03:59:03.640 align:start position:0%
business owners and so forth and to date
 
03:59:05.309 --> 03:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
we've heard that no one's had any
 
03:59:07.710 --> 03:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
responses so I would think if this
 
03:59:10.189 --> 03:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
becomes a success uccessful model my
 
03:59:12.309 --> 03:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
hope is that it can grow further and I
 
03:59:13.710 --> 03:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
believe one of the gentleman talked
 
03:59:16.269 --> 03:59:16.279 align:start position:0%
about possibly even being a connection
 
03:59:19.429 --> 03:59:19.439 align:start position:0%
on the Conway fryberg Loop in someday
 
03:59:22.309 --> 03:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
future thank you thank you thank you ref
 
03:59:24.910 --> 03:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
Mills further questions yes ref B
 
03:59:30.630 --> 03:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:33.990 --> 03:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
um the one thought is everybody keeps
 
03:59:37.189 --> 03:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
thinking about removing the rails and
 
03:59:38.990 --> 03:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
everything and
 
03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
which is going to create with especially
 
03:59:43.229 --> 03:59:43.239 align:start position:0%
with the Creo tides and stuff like that
 
03:59:45.389 --> 03:59:45.399 align:start position:0%
it's going to create other issues has
 
03:59:48.510 --> 03:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
there been any thoughts of just doing a
 
03:59:51.149 --> 03:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
overlay leaving the tracks and stuff in
 
03:59:55.030 --> 03:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
place and and overlaying on top of them
 
03:59:57.389 --> 03:59:57.399 align:start position:0%
and that way if something happens down
 
04:00:00.110 --> 04:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
the road if it needs to be reactivated
 
04:00:02.389 --> 04:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
just the overlay is done and you still
 
04:00:04.710 --> 04:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
got your track bed thank you thank you
 
04:00:07.469 --> 04:00:07.479 align:start position:0%
for the question um I have been involved
 
04:00:10.030 --> 04:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
in trails I've I have
 
04:00:13.670 --> 04:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh I have started the asby lake uh bike
 
04:00:15.990 --> 04:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
path and and many other ventures in my
 
04:00:17.630 --> 04:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
work through Lakes Region Planning
 
04:00:21.189 --> 04:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
Commission for nearly 30 years the what
 
04:00:22.950 --> 04:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
I have seen out there when they have
 
04:00:25.750 --> 04:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
filled between the rail beds whether it
 
04:00:27.910 --> 04:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
be Cinders or some other surface it
 
04:00:31.030 --> 04:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
becomes a very big maintenance item and
 
04:00:33.790 --> 04:00:33.800 align:start position:0%
who's who's going to take care of that
 
04:00:36.830 --> 04:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
these rails have no use going
 
04:00:39.389 --> 04:00:39.399 align:start position:0%
forward um are there cre assault in
 
04:00:41.950 --> 04:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
these but I I I'm hearing that if they
 
04:00:44.790 --> 04:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
were to take up the roaded and put new
 
04:00:47.429 --> 04:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
rails in in that 10 Mile section that
 
04:00:51.229 --> 04:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
would be in excess of $20
 
04:00:54.309 --> 04:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
million the um I believe North Coast
 
04:00:55.870 --> 04:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
will talk about their sections that
 
04:00:58.429 --> 04:00:58.439 align:start position:0%
they're going to rehab um and they're
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
finding that U taking the steel away
 
04:01:06.030 --> 04:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
leaving what has to be there um you know
 
04:01:08.550 --> 04:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
and will you know how much of that will
 
04:01:10.149 --> 04:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
that will be a cost number they'll look
 
04:01:14.429 --> 04:01:14.439 align:start position:0%
at as much as I love Rail and I do love
 
04:01:17.790 --> 04:01:17.800 align:start position:0%
Freight rail I don't I don't see that
 
04:01:19.710 --> 04:01:19.720 align:start position:0%
this is coming
 
04:01:22.630 --> 04:01:22.640 align:start position:0%

04:01:50.429 --> 04:01:50.439 align:start position:0%
and vice chair of the of the committee
 
04:01:51.630 --> 04:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:01:53.309 --> 04:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
committee always nice to be back in
 
04:01:55.910 --> 04:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
public works I understand you would know
 
04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
the name if the calendars didn't get
 
04:01:59.790 --> 04:01:59.800 align:start position:0%
flooded I understand yeah I I I I did
 
04:02:01.269 --> 04:02:01.279 align:start position:0%
yeah and I was one of the ones that got
 
04:02:03.790 --> 04:02:03.800 align:start position:0%
my calendar before the that's all right
 
04:02:06.910 --> 04:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
so uh I appeared before you today uh in
 
04:02:09.070 --> 04:02:09.080 align:start position:0%
favor of the the amended the amendment
 
04:02:11.189 --> 04:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire North Coast is included
 
04:02:12.790 --> 04:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
in it we appreciate that being in the
 
04:02:14.309 --> 04:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
loop I mean we are the connecting
 
04:02:16.229 --> 04:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
railroad uh and we like to know what's
 
04:02:18.990 --> 04:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
going on uh you know to to our immediate
 
04:02:22.229 --> 04:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
north um I also have the ability right
 
04:02:24.189 --> 04:02:24.199 align:start position:0%
now because we are in the middle of some
 
04:02:27.429 --> 04:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation some new rail to give you
 
04:02:31.309 --> 04:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
realtime numbers some real numbers not
 
04:02:33.510 --> 04:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
what estimates are but we've got numbers
 
04:02:36.750 --> 04:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
for taking a piece of old spur which is
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
very similar to this taking the old
 
04:02:42.750 --> 04:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
track being a spur and we can
 
04:02:44.910 --> 04:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
extrapolate how much it would cost to
 
04:02:47.510 --> 04:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
take the 70 pound rail that's to the
 
04:02:50.469 --> 04:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
north and put new ties and new Ballance
 
04:02:51.750 --> 04:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
to make it a working
 
04:02:54.630 --> 04:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
railroad um I want you hear people talk
 
04:02:57.429 --> 04:02:57.439 align:start position:0%
about pounds rail 70 pound rail 85 pound
 
04:02:59.510 --> 04:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
rail 110 pound rail 136 pound rail which
 
04:03:00.950 --> 04:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
is like the big
 
04:03:03.790 --> 04:03:03.800 align:start position:0%
stuff that that is a every three feet of
 
04:03:08.149 --> 04:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
rail that's that's how many pounds a
 
04:03:10.870 --> 04:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
pounds of rail is in three feet so it's
 
04:03:13.950 --> 04:03:13.960 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's a 75 PB rail three feet
 
04:03:16.790 --> 04:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
of that rail will weigh 75 PBS if it's
 
04:03:18.790 --> 04:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
eight if it's 115 pound 3 feet of that
 
04:03:20.830 --> 04:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
rail Will C that's how they gauge it if
 
04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
course you put them next to each other
 
04:03:25.790 --> 04:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
you'll see their different sizes um
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
so just looking at some of these numbers
 
04:03:30.590 --> 04:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
and it's why I'm happy to share these
 
04:03:31.790 --> 04:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
with the working committee because I
 
04:03:33.309 --> 04:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
think it'll be helpful but here's some
 
04:03:35.469 --> 04:03:35.479 align:start position:0%
of the things I like to share with you
 
04:03:38.070 --> 04:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
today um if you just wanted to make that
 
04:03:41.790 --> 04:03:41.800 align:start position:0%
at a working railroad I mean first off
 
04:03:43.590 --> 04:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
we understand the state law we
 
04:03:46.110 --> 04:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate and want the state law all
 
04:03:48.149 --> 04:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
quarters have to be if rail comes back
 
04:03:50.830 --> 04:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
it becomes a rail quarter and that's why
 
04:03:50.840 --> 04:03:51.510 align:start position:0%
it becomes a rail quarter and that's why
we

04:03:51.510 --> 04:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:03:54.910 --> 04:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
support know this amendment however
 
04:03:57.309 --> 04:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
let's temper that with realism uh the
 
04:03:59.910 --> 04:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
realistic part is I don't believe the
 
04:04:01.269 --> 04:04:01.279 align:start position:0%
costs are such that it'll never be
 
04:04:03.830 --> 04:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
afraid railroad just to bring it back up
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
to 70 pound which couldn't handle
 
04:04:09.189 --> 04:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
today's 100 ton per car fr
 
04:04:13.550 --> 04:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
would cost $1.6 million a mile just to
 
04:04:15.990 --> 04:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
do the tracks ballast
 
04:04:18.910 --> 04:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
ties um that doesn't
 
04:04:21.830 --> 04:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
include uh
 
04:04:25.110 --> 04:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
bridges trestles yeah I mean culverts
 
04:04:27.389 --> 04:04:27.399 align:start position:0%
underneath the rail for drainage uh
 
04:04:29.950 --> 04:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
grade Crossings and signalization that's
 
04:04:32.750 --> 04:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
going to boost that by a minimum of 25%
 
04:04:36.349 --> 04:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
as much as almost doubling it but say
 
04:04:39.910 --> 04:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
1.6 million that's go turns into two
 
04:04:42.189 --> 04:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
conservatively and that's based on our
 
04:04:45.389 --> 04:04:45.399 align:start position:0%
low bid this year in
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
2024 um that's 20 $24 going forward
 
04:04:52.990 --> 04:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
inflation is going to kick that and our
 
04:04:54.790 --> 04:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
low bid by the way that that was our low
 
04:04:58.149 --> 04:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
bid we had bids that were double that so
 
04:05:01.189 --> 04:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
it's very volatile it's very expensive
 
04:05:03.790 --> 04:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
so it is not an exaggeration I think
 
04:05:05.950 --> 04:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
it's conservative to say it would be a
 
04:05:09.189 --> 04:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
minimum of you know to do 10 miles would
 
04:05:12.309 --> 04:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
be $20 million a bare minimum and then
 
04:05:14.750 --> 04:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
what are you left with 70 pound rail
 
04:05:16.469 --> 04:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
which you really can't use you want to
 
04:05:17.830 --> 04:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
upgrade to something that's useful like
 
04:05:22.269 --> 04:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
115 pound probably cost you maybe 25 to
 
04:05:22.279 --> 04:05:23.630 align:start position:0%
115 pound probably cost you maybe 25 to
30

04:05:23.630 --> 04:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
30
 
04:05:26.990 --> 04:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
million again this is just wild because
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
you don't know how bad the bridges are
 
04:05:29.990 --> 04:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
the trestles are the culverts are you
 
04:05:32.590 --> 04:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
just have no idea but these are minimum
 
04:05:35.870 --> 04:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
I think uh costs now you look at that
 
04:05:37.550 --> 04:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
what economic engine is going to drive
 
04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
that where is there going to be enough
 
04:05:43.349 --> 04:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
volume of freight to justify that it it
 
04:05:45.070 --> 04:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
isn't going to happen and not just in
 
04:05:46.870 --> 04:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
our lifetime in anybody's lifetime
 
04:05:48.990 --> 04:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
because there there'll be some other
 
04:05:51.429 --> 04:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
need in some other urban area that has
 
04:05:53.429 --> 04:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
that draws on these funds it's just very
 
04:05:56.950 --> 04:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
very difficult so and and we fight it on
 
04:05:58.790 --> 04:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
our little railroad where we go where we
 
04:06:01.950 --> 04:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
do have active customers
 
04:06:04.229 --> 04:06:04.239 align:start position:0%
so I think one other thing I can share
 
04:06:05.870 --> 04:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
with you is the cost of taking out oh or
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
the salvage value if you wanted to get
 
04:06:10.389 --> 04:06:10.399 align:start position:0%
rid of the rail and pull it out to make
 
04:06:12.070 --> 04:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
a level surface there is salvage value
 
04:06:14.950 --> 04:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
there but again that market is all over
 
04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
the place it was really high during
 
04:06:19.149 --> 04:06:19.159 align:start position:0%
covid now it's down about 150 a ton I
 
04:06:23.910 --> 04:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
think for for Salvage steel um I think
 
04:06:26.309 --> 04:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
there may be a better value in relay
 
04:06:28.750 --> 04:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
rail you know some small railroads
 
04:06:31.429 --> 04:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
Excursion railroads want the SE go slow
 
04:06:33.269 --> 04:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
like the 70 lb relay maybe the state
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
could barter that you know the state
 
04:06:38.429 --> 04:06:38.439 align:start position:0%
could could either Salvage or so but
 
04:06:39.870 --> 04:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
there's some money that can come back in
 
04:06:42.550 --> 04:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
to pay for this the other thing is
 
04:06:44.429 --> 04:06:44.439 align:start position:0%
removing the the ties as representative
 
04:06:45.830 --> 04:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
mcon said you wouldn't want to remove
 
04:06:47.389 --> 04:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
all the ties just the ones that were
 
04:06:49.309 --> 04:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
trip hazards and the other ones you keep
 
04:06:50.590 --> 04:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
right in place because believe you take
 
04:06:52.469 --> 04:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
it out of the ground they do have Creos
 
04:06:55.590 --> 04:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
Sal they have to be disposed of our cost
 
04:06:58.269 --> 04:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
to take a disposed tie out of the rail
 
04:07:00.750 --> 04:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
right now old ties is
 
04:07:04.189 --> 04:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
$34 so it's $34 a tie and that's again
 
04:07:08.790 --> 04:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
20 $24 real bid low bid $34 a tie
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
so if you got 10,000 ties do the math
 
04:07:15.990 --> 04:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's a lot of money 340,000
 
04:07:16.000 --> 04:07:17.630 align:start position:0%
you know it's a lot of money 340,000
right

04:07:17.630 --> 04:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
so these are all considerations um that
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to share the numbers
 
04:07:25.670 --> 04:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
because we're right in the middle of it
 
04:07:27.790 --> 04:07:27.800 align:start position:0%
where we've got the bids in contractors
 
04:07:29.429 --> 04:07:29.439 align:start position:0%
been contracts have been awarded and
 
04:07:31.229 --> 04:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
we're doing construction this summer so
 
04:07:33.790 --> 04:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
we can help this working committee with
 
04:07:36.229 --> 04:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
some numbers but there may be a way to
 
04:07:38.429 --> 04:07:38.439 align:start position:0%
do it the the steel is the most is where
 
04:07:40.790 --> 04:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
there's value and the ties
 
04:07:42.830 --> 04:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
obviously the less you take out the
 
04:07:44.309 --> 04:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
better because of the great cost of
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
disposing of them I'd be happy to answer
 
04:07:48.630 --> 04:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you Mr Campbell
 
04:07:50.990 --> 04:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
questions of Mr Campell members of the
 
04:07:53.510 --> 04:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee any questions seeing none
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Campbell
 
04:07:58.750 --> 04:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I will now call upon Mr
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
Daniel I believe day from Durham New
 
04:08:03.750 --> 04:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in opposition to the bill and
 
04:08:05.389 --> 04:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
I just want to say we have a hearing
 
04:08:07.030 --> 04:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
coming up in a few minutes so if we
 
04:08:08.790 --> 04:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
could try to keep Our Testimony to what
 
04:08:12.189 --> 04:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
you wrote if not a little shorter and
 
04:08:13.830 --> 04:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
just keep that in mind because we have
 
04:08:15.269 --> 04:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
another hearing scheduled for and I
 
04:08:16.990 --> 04:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to go over too much thank you
 
04:08:18.910 --> 04:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
Mr day yeah know I understand I'll keep
 
04:08:21.950 --> 04:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
this brief and yes my name is Daniel day
 
04:08:24.149 --> 04:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
um last name spelled DIY I am from
 
04:08:27.349 --> 04:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
Durham and I am the Visionary of a
 
04:08:29.830 --> 04:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
startup company that actually has an
 
04:08:32.469 --> 04:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
immediate on rail commercial interest in
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
a portion of the Conway branch and I am
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
also aware of at least two other people
 
04:08:40.870 --> 04:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
who have expressed commercial interest
 
04:08:45.870 --> 04:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
in the line as well so we all know that
 
04:08:48.510 --> 04:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
there is actual commercial potential for
 
04:08:50.830 --> 04:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
at least a portion of this line um the
 
04:08:54.750 --> 04:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
exact portion is yet to be determined I
 
04:08:57.070 --> 04:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
have read previous reports of the line
 
04:08:59.309 --> 04:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
and believe my plan would go well within
 
04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
the parameters of what is best for the
 
04:09:03.990 --> 04:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
region and I am working with a team of
 
04:09:07.309 --> 04:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
experts and Industry professionals with
 
04:09:09.670 --> 04:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
to and have been in talks with the
 
04:09:14.590 --> 04:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
do as well as um a neighboring property
 
04:09:16.710 --> 04:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
and all the talks have been very
 
04:09:19.030 --> 04:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
positive and I am confident that my
 
04:09:20.590 --> 04:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
proposal would be an economic
 
04:09:23.630 --> 04:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
development driver to the area an
 
04:09:26.189 --> 04:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
exciting Revenue opportunity for the
 
04:09:28.670 --> 04:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
state and just an overall great
 
04:09:30.469 --> 04:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the people of New
 
04:09:34.030 --> 04:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I believe we should keep
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
our options open with the RFP and and
 
04:09:41.309 --> 04:09:41.319 align:start position:0%
give people a chance to submit their
 
04:09:43.670 --> 04:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
proposals okay thank you questions of
 
04:09:45.309 --> 04:09:45.319 align:start position:0%

04:09:47.670 --> 04:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
committee question the gentleman okay
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%

04:09:56.670 --> 04:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
very much okay thank you very much for
 
04:09:59.670 --> 04:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
your testimony I will now call upon Mr
 
04:10:01.990 --> 04:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
Mike Lacy of Conway New Hampshire
 
04:10:04.469 --> 04:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
representing the I believe it's
 
04:10:10.950 --> 04:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:12.229 --> 04:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
okay welcome to Public Works and
 
04:10:14.790 --> 04:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
highways Mr Lacy okay there's two of you
 
04:10:16.830 --> 04:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
yeah there's there's two of us uh so
 
04:10:18.510 --> 04:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
okay could you the only thing is could
 
04:10:20.389 --> 04:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
the other one s out a pink card too
 
04:10:22.469 --> 04:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
please that's our rules absolutely okay
 
04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
all right and you're Mr Lacy right no
 
04:10:27.910 --> 04:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
actually this is Mike okay so uh I I
 
04:10:29.630 --> 04:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
asked Mike to go ahead and drive down
 
04:10:31.790 --> 04:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
here because I actually flew from a
 
04:10:34.510 --> 04:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
meeting in North Carolina this morning
 
04:10:36.870 --> 04:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
to attend this okay and your name sir
 
04:10:39.590 --> 04:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
David and I'm the owner of the Conway
 
04:10:41.269 --> 04:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
Scenic okay and I appreciate you filling
 
04:10:43.510 --> 04:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
a pink card afterwards so absolutely
 
04:10:47.790 --> 04:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
well so um I guess I I just wanted to uh
 
04:10:51.990 --> 04:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
express my interest in always having the
 
04:10:54.950 --> 04:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
ability to bring new equipment into the
 
04:10:56.710 --> 04:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
Conway cic Railroad and currently we
 
04:10:59.670 --> 04:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
have a connection to the north very long
 
04:11:01.109 --> 04:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
and what's problematic with that
 
04:11:04.229 --> 04:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
connection is it's seasonal so every
 
04:11:06.469 --> 04:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
time the snow comes there's snow slides
 
04:11:08.590 --> 04:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
there all kinds of diff difficulties so
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's not really a practical system to
 
04:11:14.149 --> 04:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
get new equipment to the railroad now we
 
04:11:16.590 --> 04:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
purchased Conway Scenic five years ago
 
04:11:18.550 --> 04:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
we've effectively doubled the size of
 
04:11:20.950 --> 04:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
the company so there's tremendous
 
04:11:23.790 --> 04:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
economic benefit to our railroad right
 
04:11:26.269 --> 04:11:26.279 align:start position:0%
now in the last five years it we've
 
04:11:30.389 --> 04:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
contributed approximately $154 million
 
04:11:32.910 --> 04:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
to the state economy so lots of good
 
04:11:35.469 --> 04:11:35.479 align:start position:0%
stuff so my primary thing is we'd like
 
04:11:37.349 --> 04:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and have a reliable con
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
connection if the North Coast Road want
 
04:11:41.670 --> 04:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
to work with us perhaps that's an
 
04:11:44.710 --> 04:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity going south of here um when
 
04:11:47.590 --> 04:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
you look at these Rail lines one thing I
 
04:11:50.309 --> 04:11:50.319 align:start position:0%
would suggest is you know the department
 
04:11:53.630 --> 04:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
of rail Transit has really done a lot of
 
04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
work to go ahead and try to develop what
 
04:11:59.109 --> 04:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
we should do with these Rail lines for
 
04:12:00.790 --> 04:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
the future it's not just about today
 
04:12:02.910 --> 04:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
it's the future I would definitely
 
04:12:05.189 --> 04:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
suggest that we go through that process
 
04:12:08.109 --> 04:12:08.119 align:start position:0%
see what the RFP turns up because maybe
 
04:12:09.790 --> 04:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
it's something that Conway Scenic works
 
04:12:11.630 --> 04:12:11.640 align:start position:0%
with the North Coast and you have an
 
04:12:14.070 --> 04:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go ahead and do something
 
04:12:17.429 --> 04:12:17.439 align:start position:0%
else so from that standpoint I really
 
04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time today and uh and
 
04:12:23.149 --> 04:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you Mr s uh Mr Lacy
 
04:12:25.109 --> 04:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
you all set you don't have anything okay
 
04:12:27.990 --> 04:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
good and questions of Mr s or Mr Lacy
 
04:12:29.429 --> 04:12:29.439 align:start position:0%
from members of the
 
04:12:31.990 --> 04:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee are there any questions yes
 
04:12:35.710 --> 04:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
represent bogert please so you
 
04:12:38.990 --> 04:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
support what they're trying to do or do
 
04:12:41.229 --> 04:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
you support what they're trying to do
 
04:12:44.710 --> 04:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
with the caveat of the continuance of
 
04:12:49.070 --> 04:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
the RFP uh with the caveat of the RFP
 
04:12:50.830 --> 04:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
because I I think it's very important to
 
04:12:53.189 --> 04:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
go and fulfill and go through that
 
04:12:54.790 --> 04:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
process because it was a well thought
 
04:12:58.950 --> 04:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
out process and that can root out and
 
04:13:02.070 --> 04:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
quantify you know what reality is here
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
because uh just us sitting here it's not
 
04:13:07.309 --> 04:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
something that you know we're painting
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
accurate picture so I think that we had
 
04:13:10.870 --> 04:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
to go through that
 
04:13:12.830 --> 04:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
process thank you a representative
 
04:13:15.149 --> 04:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
jurist please follow by represent you Mr
 
04:13:18.309 --> 04:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr s i when you talk about
 
04:13:20.309 --> 04:13:20.319 align:start position:0%
making a connection you mean making a
 
04:13:23.030 --> 04:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
connection on the on the Conway Scenic
 
04:13:26.429 --> 04:13:26.439 align:start position:0%
in in every direction including this
 
04:13:30.510 --> 04:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
this possible right away or or uh did I
 
04:13:32.910 --> 04:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstand well current so current
 
04:13:35.950 --> 04:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
yes what I'm trying to say here is that
 
04:13:38.109 --> 04:13:38.119 align:start position:0%
currently the
 
04:13:40.910 --> 04:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
the dot is studying the different Rail
 
04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
lines in the state and they're trying to
 
04:13:45.830 --> 04:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
see what the best moves going forward
 
04:13:48.790 --> 04:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
are if you look at uh a connection
 
04:13:50.550 --> 04:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
providing a connection to the outside
 
04:13:52.910 --> 04:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
world for Conway Scenic which is really
 
04:13:55.510 --> 04:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
important for future growth of that
 
04:13:59.109 --> 04:13:59.119 align:start position:0%
company of our company uh South seems to
 
04:14:03.670 --> 04:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
be a very reasonable way of doing it so
 
04:14:06.349 --> 04:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
until we bet this process out we can't
 
04:14:10.349 --> 04:14:10.359 align:start position:0%
really decide what to do thank you
 
04:14:12.109 --> 04:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you uh represent
 
04:14:14.670 --> 04:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
Newton please thank you Mr chairman
 
04:14:17.269 --> 04:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so if you
 
04:14:20.389 --> 04:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
had a chance to review the amendment and
 
04:14:22.830 --> 04:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
would you say that this would be helpful
 
04:14:24.590 --> 04:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
in what you're trying to do or would it
 
04:14:26.229 --> 04:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
be restrictive in what you're trying to
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
do so unfortunately we haven't had a
 
04:14:30.389 --> 04:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
chance to review the amendment we were
 
04:14:32.429 --> 04:14:32.439 align:start position:0%
just invited to this meeting without
 
04:14:36.070 --> 04:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:36.080 --> 04:14:38.269 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:14:38.269 --> 04:14:38.279 align:start position:0%

from various businesses in support of
 
04:15:42.950 --> 04:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
the bill and I'm hoping that they'll be
 
04:15:45.469 --> 04:15:45.479 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the public record yeah
 
04:15:47.469 --> 04:15:47.479 align:start position:0%

27 and the house bill 1510 establishing
 
04:18:30.349 --> 04:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
a commission to identify barriers to and
 
04:18:33.910 --> 04:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
solutions for electric vehicles sales
 
04:18:37.950 --> 04:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
and use and I believe I have the prime
 
04:18:42.750 --> 04:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh representative Rebecca
 
04:18:46.030 --> 04:18:46.040 align:start position:0%

uh House Bill thank you very much chair
 
04:18:53.630 --> 04:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee it's a pleasure
 
04:18:55.469 --> 04:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
to be here for the record my name is
 
04:18:57.870 --> 04:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
representative Rebecca McWilliams I'm
 
04:18:59.189 --> 04:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
from South conquered you're sitting in
 
04:19:00.670 --> 04:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
one of my districts it's a pleasure to
 
04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
host you um and so I'm I'm here to talk
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit about EVS I've passed out
 
04:19:09.469 --> 04:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
both an amendment to the bill that I'm
 
04:19:11.590 --> 04:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
presenting as well as an article that
 
04:19:13.269 --> 04:19:13.279 align:start position:0%
some of you already saw the last time I
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
was here for very brief appearance um
 
04:19:17.990 --> 04:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
and I know that this committee has heard
 
04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
some other bills about EVs and the
 
04:19:21.910 --> 04:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
status of EVS so I don't want to spend a
 
04:19:24.269 --> 04:19:24.279 align:start position:0%
ton of time talking about history or
 
04:19:26.550 --> 04:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
technology or anything like that happy
 
04:19:28.349 --> 04:19:28.359 align:start position:0%
to have a sidebar with individuals about
 
04:19:30.189 --> 04:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
those topics because I'm very passionate
 
04:19:32.630 --> 04:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
about them uh but big picture I think
 
04:19:35.830 --> 04:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's uh fair to say that EVS are
 
04:19:38.590 --> 04:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
definitely a hot topic right now in uh
 
04:19:41.229 --> 04:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
political circles and the legislature uh
 
04:19:43.109 --> 04:19:43.119 align:start position:0%
and therefore I think it is appropriate
 
04:19:44.910 --> 04:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
for us to take some time and actually
 
04:19:47.269 --> 04:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
look into where are we and what should
 
04:19:49.229 --> 04:19:49.239 align:start position:0%
we be doing in terms of public health
 
04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
safety and Welfare um and as well as
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
industry adoption and changes in
 
04:19:56.870 --> 04:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
transportation um that being said there
 
04:19:59.269 --> 04:19:59.279 align:start position:0%
is a sister bill I would describe it as
 
04:20:02.710 --> 04:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
a sister bill um in the Senate right now
 
04:20:05.790 --> 04:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
uh how Senate Bill 430 um which is
 
04:20:08.870 --> 04:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
similar but not quite the same um the
 
04:20:11.630 --> 04:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
title of that bill is a council to study
 
04:20:13.349 --> 04:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
the impacts of electric vehicles
 
04:20:15.309 --> 04:20:15.319 align:start position:0%
e-mobility devices and Associated
 
04:20:17.950 --> 04:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
lithium ion batteries on first responder
 
04:20:19.870 --> 04:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
response the environment building and
 
04:20:21.750 --> 04:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
fire codes life safety and property
 
04:20:23.830 --> 04:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
protection all things that we're charged
 
04:20:25.429 --> 04:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
with taking care of as elected
 
04:20:26.990 --> 04:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
representatives we care about the health
 
04:20:29.790 --> 04:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
and safety of our constituents um so
 
04:20:31.550 --> 04:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
this bill that I've presenting on the
 
04:20:35.109 --> 04:20:35.119 align:start position:0%
house side um is similar in that uh the
 
04:20:37.030 --> 04:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
the charge of this goal is to identify
 
04:20:39.070 --> 04:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
barriers and solutions to Electric
 
04:20:41.590 --> 04:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
Vehicle sales and use and I would
 
04:20:43.750 --> 04:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
certainly say use is sort of a big
 
04:20:46.229 --> 04:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
picture which includes First Responders
 
04:20:48.710 --> 04:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
the environment building and fire codes
 
04:20:50.189 --> 04:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
um so I think there's probably a way for
 
04:20:51.990 --> 04:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
us to figure this out and I imagine that
 
04:20:53.349 --> 04:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
there may be a committee of conference
 
04:20:55.429 --> 04:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
to reconcile the goals of both of these
 
04:20:59.710 --> 04:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
two bills um that being said uh between
 
04:21:01.030 --> 04:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
the last time I was here at this
 
04:21:03.630 --> 04:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
committee and uh today I had a great
 
04:21:05.109 --> 04:21:05.119 align:start position:0%
conversation with the folks at the
 
04:21:07.070 --> 04:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services
 
04:21:09.030 --> 04:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
in regards to how commissions must be
 
04:21:11.870 --> 04:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
structured um and I didn't realize until
 
04:21:14.510 --> 04:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
I sent out this amendment that we needed
 
04:21:16.870 --> 04:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
to have one more elected official than
 
04:21:18.830 --> 04:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
we do members of the public on a
 
04:21:20.750 --> 04:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
commission so the amendment that I
 
04:21:23.670 --> 04:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
passed out today includes seven elected
 
04:21:27.070 --> 04:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
officials and six of the other people
 
04:21:29.590 --> 04:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
who are not electeds to meet our
 
04:21:31.550 --> 04:21:31.560 align:start position:0%
criteria that you need to have one more
 
04:21:35.469 --> 04:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
legislator on the commission um and uh
 
04:21:37.149 --> 04:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
and so that that was sort of a scrier
 
04:21:39.389 --> 04:21:39.399 align:start position:0%
error on my part I apologize but also I
 
04:21:41.429 --> 04:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
hope this makes it right in terms of the
 
04:21:43.790 --> 04:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
makeup of the commission um I think
 
04:21:45.510 --> 04:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
you've probably already heard a lot in
 
04:21:47.189 --> 04:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
the news and possibly even another
 
04:21:49.469 --> 04:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
testimony on this committee about um
 
04:21:52.710 --> 04:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
safety and concerns with ev's uh
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
spontaneously combusting right we've
 
04:21:56.109 --> 04:21:56.119 align:start position:0%
we've certainly heard some of this on
 
04:21:58.790 --> 04:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
the news about um certain EVS not being
 
04:22:00.830 --> 04:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
safe for public use or at least having
 
04:22:03.189 --> 04:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
some concerns about that as well as
 
04:22:05.429 --> 04:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
charger fires um wherever the Chargers
 
04:22:08.429 --> 04:22:08.439 align:start position:0%
are located um poor installation or
 
04:22:11.710 --> 04:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
faulty uh mechanics and I do think that
 
04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
that's something that as a commission we
 
04:22:14.950 --> 04:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
should be looking into because this has
 
04:22:16.830 --> 04:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
to do with Public Safety and the health
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
of our constituents um big picture I
 
04:22:21.469 --> 04:22:21.479 align:start position:0%
know that the automotive Dealers
 
04:22:25.309 --> 04:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
Association in New Hampshire has been uh
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
interested in figuring out what what
 
04:22:29.269 --> 04:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
needs to happen for the market to shift
 
04:22:31.269 --> 04:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um I know that in
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
states around New Hampshire there have
 
04:22:35.710 --> 04:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
been some programs for cash on the hoods
 
04:22:37.790 --> 04:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
or some kind kind of rebate program for
 
04:22:40.950 --> 04:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
purchasing EVS as the market shifts New
 
04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has not adopted such a program
 
04:22:44.710 --> 04:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
but it be could be something to look
 
04:22:47.349 --> 04:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
into and really it's at the discretion
 
04:22:49.309 --> 04:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
of this commission to decide how things
 
04:22:50.910 --> 04:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
are handled and what the recommendations
 
04:22:53.830 --> 04:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
are in the report to come um so for all
 
04:22:56.030 --> 04:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that I've outlined this
 
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
is really a goal to get something
 
04:22:59.990 --> 04:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
together to talk about it and see what
 
04:23:01.750 --> 04:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
we can do as a
 
04:23:04.550 --> 04:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
legislature um also I do want to note
 
04:23:07.710 --> 04:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
that there was um in
 
04:23:10.590 --> 04:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
2018 this is a very thick report so I've
 
04:23:12.109 --> 04:23:12.119 align:start position:0%
emailed it to everyone instead of
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
printing it and send and giving it to
 
04:23:16.790 --> 04:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
you on paper copy um but in 2018 there
 
04:23:18.590 --> 04:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
was a study
 
04:23:21.309 --> 04:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
commission um under Senate Bill
 
04:23:24.910 --> 04:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
517 chapter 1541 laws of
 
04:23:27.910 --> 04:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
2018 it was a electric vehicle charging
 
04:23:31.030 --> 04:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
stations infrastructure commission which
 
04:23:32.910 --> 04:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
also looked at some of the things that
 
04:23:34.269 --> 04:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
we're now seeing becoming more
 
04:23:36.990 --> 04:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
mainstream with EVs and so this would be
 
04:23:40.910 --> 04:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
a follow-up commission to look at again
 
04:23:42.630 --> 04:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
some of the health and safety concerns
 
04:23:45.109 --> 04:23:45.119 align:start position:0%
that came out of the report I've emailed
 
04:23:46.510 --> 04:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
it to everyone if you want to spend some
 
04:23:48.910 --> 04:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
time reading it at another date so with
 
04:23:51.149 --> 04:23:51.159 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:58.349 --> 04:23:58.359 align:start position:0%
representative yes I'm sorry uh
 
04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative fauler please thank you
 
04:24:04.670 --> 04:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
for the question um first uh I'm a EV
 
04:24:07.630 --> 04:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
owner just to point of view learned a
 
04:24:10.109 --> 04:24:10.119 align:start position:0%
lot about them the course of buying them
 
04:24:11.429 --> 04:24:11.439 align:start position:0%
it seems like we have a lot of
 
04:24:13.309 --> 04:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
experience and a lot of knowledge
 
04:24:14.590 --> 04:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
especially if we go to other states
 
04:24:17.710 --> 04:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
other countries in terms of how how to
 
04:24:19.510 --> 04:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
deal with these somebody's El figured
 
04:24:21.670 --> 04:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
out this problem how do we keep this
 
04:24:23.870 --> 04:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
commission from basically kind of
 
04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
falling into a debate on climate change
 
04:24:29.910 --> 04:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
or other sort of
 
04:24:33.670 --> 04:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
political U Hot Topic items instead of
 
04:24:35.750 --> 04:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
and and and perhaps make it focus on
 
04:24:38.510 --> 04:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
what it is that we need to do to solve
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
whatever problems we
 
04:24:43.510 --> 04:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
identify uh is this
 
04:24:46.870 --> 04:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
a I'm just concerned that the subject
 
04:24:48.710 --> 04:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
matter is too wide open and we'll kind
 
04:24:51.790 --> 04:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
of fall into General things as there
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
language that could could make that more
 
04:24:56.990 --> 04:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
focused um thank you very much for the
 
04:25:00.269 --> 04:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
question uh I would say that uh the
 
04:25:03.550 --> 04:25:03.560 align:start position:0%
charge is specific on this bill and
 
04:25:04.910 --> 04:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
again this may be reconciled with the
 
04:25:06.790 --> 04:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
Senate bill but the charge is specific
 
04:25:08.950 --> 04:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
on this bill to study identify barriers
 
04:25:10.910 --> 04:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
to and solutions for electric vehicle
 
04:25:13.710 --> 04:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
sales and use so if there's a way to
 
04:25:15.469 --> 04:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
sort of tailor that to be a little bit
 
04:25:19.389 --> 04:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
more specific to the economics of said
 
04:25:22.910 --> 04:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
topic um nowhere in this does it say
 
04:25:25.149 --> 04:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
climate change and I know those can be
 
04:25:28.429 --> 04:25:28.439 align:start position:0%
very incendiary terms so this is really
 
04:25:32.469 --> 04:25:32.479 align:start position:0%
more about a changing Market um and what
 
04:25:34.389 --> 04:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
we are doing in response to a changing
 
04:25:37.149 --> 04:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
Market as opposed to things that can be
 
04:25:39.910 --> 04:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
hot topics I would say that uh because
 
04:25:42.950 --> 04:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
we have seven elected officials on the
 
04:25:45.710 --> 04:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
commission the select the selection of
 
04:25:47.550 --> 04:25:47.560 align:start position:0%
those seven elected officials makes a
 
04:25:49.389 --> 04:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
big deal about what's discussed at each
 
04:25:52.870 --> 04:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
of their meetings obviously and so um
 
04:25:55.109 --> 04:25:55.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not responsible for appointing those
 
04:25:57.030 --> 04:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
seven people but if there are
 
04:25:59.309 --> 04:25:59.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations for those seven people
 
04:26:02.149 --> 04:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
who could stay away from hot button
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
topic discussions that's probably a path
 
04:26:08.389 --> 04:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
towards finding some answers and so I
 
04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
would leave that to the speaker and the
 
04:26:12.349 --> 04:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
minority leader if this bill moves
 
04:26:14.309 --> 04:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
forward because we really do want to get
 
04:26:15.349 --> 04:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
some good
 
04:26:18.109 --> 04:26:18.119 align:start position:0%
answers thank you further questions
 
04:26:20.830 --> 04:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
representative mcams uh representative
 
04:26:22.710 --> 04:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
cludia hey thank you representative MC
 
04:26:25.469 --> 04:26:25.479 align:start position:0%
Williams I noticed on Roman numeral five
 
04:26:28.149 --> 04:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
of the bill it says the commission shall
 
04:26:29.710 --> 04:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
report its findings and any
 
04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations for proposed legislation
 
04:26:33.710 --> 04:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
to the Speaker of the House of
 
04:26:35.149 --> 04:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
Representatives the president of the
 
04:26:37.510 --> 04:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
Senate and the house clerk Senate clerk
 
04:26:40.229 --> 04:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
governor and State library on or before
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
December 31st of 2026 I was just curious
 
04:26:45.670 --> 04:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
why you pick that particular date which
 
04:26:49.229 --> 04:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
is a little far out you know for some
 
04:26:53.349 --> 04:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
people uh sure I think that
 
04:26:55.990 --> 04:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
um it's the sort of topic that deserves
 
04:26:58.950 --> 04:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
good uh significant amount of study um
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
and imagining that probably there won't
 
04:27:03.389 --> 04:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
be much work performed this year
 
04:27:07.590 --> 04:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
2024 so it would really be a 20 25 and
 
04:27:10.710 --> 04:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
2026 duration that that was my intent
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
I'm open to an amendment on that date
 
04:27:14.590 --> 04:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative mck
 
04:27:17.510 --> 04:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
Williams further questions for the
 
04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative I have a question for you
 
04:27:24.109 --> 04:27:24.119 align:start position:0%
representative um thank you for this
 
04:27:27.630 --> 04:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
um I've had the pleasure of as several
 
04:27:28.910 --> 04:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
of the members of this committee have
 
04:27:31.109 --> 04:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
had the pleasure of being on another
 
04:27:34.269 --> 04:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
commission and finding as you just said
 
04:27:35.950 --> 04:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
time in the first year runs out very
 
04:27:37.670 --> 04:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
very quickly so you need to be out at
 
04:27:39.030 --> 04:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
least two or three
 
04:27:43.510 --> 04:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
years I do could you tell me I know it
 
04:27:46.830 --> 04:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
will be the commission's job but can you
 
04:27:49.710 --> 04:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
identify a few barriers as you see them
 
04:27:51.750 --> 04:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
right now in this
 
04:27:55.830 --> 04:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
process uh sure this is highly technical
 
04:27:58.710 --> 04:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
uh but keep it simple for Mark okay
 
04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
technical all right um so at the federal
 
04:28:05.910 --> 04:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
level um we have an air emissions
 
04:28:08.710 --> 04:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
standard that has been adopted by most
 
04:28:10.790 --> 04:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
of the states in the Northeast New
 
04:28:12.309 --> 04:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has not adopted that air
 
04:28:15.030 --> 04:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
emission standard uh the manufacturers
 
04:28:17.710 --> 04:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
of vehicles the big ones at least but
 
04:28:20.710 --> 04:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
pretty much every manufacturer 4gm Etc
 
04:28:24.830 --> 04:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
um have prioritized delivering EVS to
 
04:28:27.309 --> 04:28:27.319 align:start position:0%
dealers in States who have adopted the
 
04:28:29.469 --> 04:28:29.479 align:start position:0%
federal air emission standard which
 
04:28:31.990 --> 04:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
means that when they're loading up their
 
04:28:34.030 --> 04:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
18wheeler and they're putting all the
 
04:28:35.750 --> 04:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
EVS on there to deliver them to deal
 
04:28:37.429 --> 04:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
dealers in different states New
 
04:28:39.229 --> 04:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is dead last in the Northeast
 
04:28:41.469 --> 04:28:41.479 align:start position:0%
for priority of delivery of EVS because
 
04:28:46.510 --> 04:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:46.520 --> 04:28:48.149 align:start position:0%
 
standard

04:28:48.149 --> 04:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
standard
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that sure uh any
 
04:28:53.510 --> 04:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
other further questions at this
 
04:28:55.550 --> 04:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
point thank you for your testimony
 
04:28:57.189 --> 04:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
you'll have an opportunity at the end if
 
04:28:59.389 --> 04:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
there's something else you'd like to say
 
04:29:04.030 --> 04:29:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:06.870 --> 04:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
second uh second
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:15.750 --> 04:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
Marshall welcome sir welcome to public
 
04:29:18.109 --> 04:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
works good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
04:29:21.269 --> 04:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
having me today uh representative MC
 
04:29:23.389 --> 04:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
Williams at a a great job doing an intro
 
04:29:24.910 --> 04:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
and I think it sounds like you've had a
 
04:29:26.590 --> 04:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
fair amount of information on this so
 
04:29:29.070 --> 04:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
far so I did send some written testimony
 
04:29:30.269 --> 04:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
hopefully I made it through the portal I
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
don't know we made it there but um the
 
04:29:36.990 --> 04:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
in regards to sen Bill uh 4:30 uh the
 
04:29:38.790 --> 04:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
department of safety has kind of helped
 
04:29:41.309 --> 04:29:41.319 align:start position:0%
initiate that bill over the summer uh
 
04:29:42.950 --> 04:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
the Fire Marshal's Office brought a
 
04:29:45.510 --> 04:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
group together stakeholders um to try to
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
start talking about this mostly from the
 
04:29:49.269 --> 04:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
public safety perspective police and
 
04:29:52.910 --> 04:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
fire response um it included a lot of
 
04:29:54.469 --> 04:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
people it included the Fire Marshal's
 
04:29:56.269 --> 04:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
Office the New Hampshire Fire Chiefs New
 
04:29:58.189 --> 04:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police Chiefs uh Department of
 
04:30:01.710 --> 04:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation d uh DMV DS uh auto
 
04:30:04.070 --> 04:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
dealers tow Association and there's
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
probably up to 20 people that we've been
 
04:30:08.349 --> 04:30:08.359 align:start position:0%
meeting we've had three meetings so far
 
04:30:10.510 --> 04:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
and the thought we had is just really to
 
04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
take a moment to take some time and
 
04:30:14.189 --> 04:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
understand the issue and put some
 
04:30:16.109 --> 04:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
thought into it rather than just the
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
shotgun approach that we've seen so far
 
04:30:20.790 --> 04:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
I think this session where uh outright
 
04:30:22.750 --> 04:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
bans and
 
04:30:25.590 --> 04:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
um uh prohibit proh prohibiting them
 
04:30:27.070 --> 04:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
from parking garages for instance and
 
04:30:30.349 --> 04:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
things like that so our goal um that
 
04:30:31.550 --> 04:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
we've been working on in the fire
 
04:30:33.070 --> 04:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
Marshall's office is really to try to
 
04:30:36.189 --> 04:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
gather data um there's about 400 car
 
04:30:38.910 --> 04:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
fires uh reported in the state a year
 
04:30:41.950 --> 04:30:41.960 align:start position:0%
and um we think only about two of those
 
04:30:45.510 --> 04:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
fires were electric vehicle fires um The
 
04:30:46.750 --> 04:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
Challenge from the fire service
 
04:30:49.070 --> 04:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
perspective is when when a electric
 
04:30:52.189 --> 04:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
vehicle fire happens they're more severe
 
04:30:54.149 --> 04:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
and the tactics to put them out is much
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
different much more demanding on
 
04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
resources especially from the water spy
 
04:31:02.149 --> 04:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
perspective um versus an internal
 
04:31:05.750 --> 04:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
combustion uh vehicle so uh we we just
 
04:31:08.070 --> 04:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
the the lithium ion batteries in general
 
04:31:09.910 --> 04:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
they they they're subject to Thermal
 
04:31:11.910 --> 04:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
runaway and they're a little bit less
 
04:31:14.910 --> 04:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
predictable so we want time to kind of
 
04:31:16.429 --> 04:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
look at what the national work's going
 
04:31:18.030 --> 04:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
on there's a ton of national work going
 
04:31:21.469 --> 04:31:21.479 align:start position:0%
on uh from the code perspective um the
 
04:31:23.670 --> 04:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
International Code Council has stood up
 
04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc committee to look at batteries
 
04:31:27.670 --> 04:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
um NFPA which is the National Fire
 
04:31:30.269 --> 04:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
Protection Association uh has a A
 
04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
Research Foundation they stood up a
 
04:31:33.950 --> 04:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
group to look at batteries and car
 
04:31:36.510 --> 04:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
related fires and then UL Underwriters
 
04:31:38.590 --> 04:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
lab uh their Fire Safety Research
 
04:31:41.309 --> 04:31:41.319 align:start position:0%
Institute set up a um a program to look
 
04:31:43.830 --> 04:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
at car fires they they're going to go so
 
04:31:46.229 --> 04:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
far as to look at the differences a lot
 
04:31:48.349 --> 04:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
of the studies that we saw from cars are
 
04:31:50.710 --> 04:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
from vehicles in the 70s and 80s and as
 
04:31:51.990 --> 04:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
we know vehicles have a lot more
 
04:31:53.710 --> 04:31:53.720 align:start position:0%
Plastics in them now so you know really
 
04:31:54.950 --> 04:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
taking a hard look at what's the
 
04:31:56.790 --> 04:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
difference between the cars that we know
 
04:31:58.670 --> 04:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
of the 70s and 80s which more more steel
 
04:32:00.590 --> 04:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
and steel and you know metal Parts
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
versus what the Plastics and then
 
04:32:04.750 --> 04:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the EV stuff so I think in
 
04:32:06.550 --> 04:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
general uh the department of safety and
 
04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
and the fire marshal office supports
 
04:32:09.910 --> 04:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
bringing a group of stakeholders
 
04:32:11.590 --> 04:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
together to really take a look at this
 
04:32:13.229 --> 04:32:13.239 align:start position:0%
look at the national information that's
 
04:32:14.710 --> 04:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
available look at the national studies
 
04:32:16.429 --> 04:32:16.439 align:start position:0%
that are happening really take a look at
 
04:32:18.670 --> 04:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
what's happening in our state from a um
 
04:32:20.590 --> 04:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
from a data perspective and make good
 
04:32:23.790 --> 04:32:23.800 align:start position:0%
decisions um rather than just blanketly
 
04:32:26.349 --> 04:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
you know uh getting into situations
 
04:32:27.510 --> 04:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
where we're prohibiting outrate
 
04:32:29.189 --> 04:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the vehicles or things like
 
04:32:31.870 --> 04:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
that without really a thoughtful process
 
04:32:35.229 --> 04:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
so um again we're supportive of that um
 
04:32:36.990 --> 04:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
you you know and happy to answer any
 
04:32:39.309 --> 04:32:39.319 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you any
 
04:32:41.269 --> 04:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
questions for the fire marshal yes
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
rebner I really want to commend that uh
 
04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
that point of view I think that that's
 
04:32:47.590 --> 04:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
very helpful and I'm wondering if there
 
04:32:50.550 --> 04:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
any parallels I know at one
 
04:32:53.630 --> 04:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
time fire departments weren't U equipped
 
04:32:55.830 --> 04:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
to deal with with gasoline powered
 
04:32:57.630 --> 04:32:57.640 align:start position:0%
vehicles and over the last 100 years or
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
so we've developed equipment are there
 
04:33:02.910 --> 04:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
any parallels that you see between the
 
04:33:07.150 --> 04:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
adoption of Motor Vehicles 100 years 125
 
04:33:10.269 --> 04:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
years ago versus where we're facing it
 
04:33:12.269 --> 04:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
now and and how was how different fire
 
04:33:14.670 --> 04:33:14.680 align:start position:0%
departments responded to that yeah thank
 
04:33:16.470 --> 04:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
you I I I think that in general what
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
we've said is that technology has
 
04:33:20.109 --> 04:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
outpaced us in a lot of these areas and
 
04:33:21.910 --> 04:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's just taking some time to come up so
 
04:33:23.390 --> 04:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
there's there's different things that
 
04:33:24.789 --> 04:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
are coming out there's blankets to put
 
04:33:26.551 --> 04:33:26.561 align:start position:0%
over vehic electric vehicles which
 
04:33:28.310 --> 04:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
probably could translate to a regular
 
04:33:30.750 --> 04:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle as well but um there's there's
 
04:33:32.390 --> 04:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
special nozzles to try to get up under
 
04:33:34.189 --> 04:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
the batteries so right now everyone's
 
04:33:36.230 --> 04:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
just trying to learn at this point Point
 
04:33:38.189 --> 04:33:38.199 align:start position:0%
um so I I think we're we're really in
 
04:33:40.551 --> 04:33:40.561 align:start position:0%
that learning phase but because of the
 
04:33:42.349 --> 04:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
intensity of it and the time it takes to
 
04:33:43.869 --> 04:33:43.879 align:start position:0%
put the fires out everything's kind of
 
04:33:46.029 --> 04:33:46.039 align:start position:0%
in a sort of a you know a little bit of
 
04:33:47.789 --> 04:33:47.799 align:start position:0%
a pause and it's a concern right if we
 
04:33:50.310 --> 04:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
shut down for here at home shut down 93
 
04:33:52.429 --> 04:33:52.439 align:start position:0%
on a Friday afternoon in the summer or
 
04:33:54.590 --> 04:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
ski season in the winter because we're
 
04:33:55.949 --> 04:33:55.959 align:start position:0%
we're three four hours trying to put
 
04:33:58.349 --> 04:33:58.359 align:start position:0%
this vehicle fire out um it's very
 
04:34:00.390 --> 04:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
different than conquer fire going out
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
and putting a car fire out in a few
 
04:34:05.670 --> 04:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
minutes uh right now so um I think it's
 
04:34:06.830 --> 04:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
going to take a little bit time to
 
04:34:09.109 --> 04:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
evolve um there's there's a little bit
 
04:34:10.949 --> 04:34:10.959 align:start position:0%
of a growing mindset of that vehicle
 
04:34:13.551 --> 04:34:13.561 align:start position:0%
fire say go back to the 93 example is
 
04:34:16.109 --> 04:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
just knock it down get it on a recer and
 
04:34:17.910 --> 04:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
get it off the highway and then get it
 
04:34:20.269 --> 04:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
to a safe spot and probably let it burn
 
04:34:22.070 --> 04:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
but then you know it gets into some of
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
the climate decisions of is it what's
 
04:34:25.869 --> 04:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
better is the water runoff going to be
 
04:34:27.070 --> 04:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
an issue when we put thousands of
 
04:34:28.869 --> 04:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
gallons of water on it or is just to let
 
04:34:30.390 --> 04:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
it burn and what's the air quality issue
 
04:34:33.150 --> 04:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
so I think some of that's just grappling
 
04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
um I think the biggest thing from the
 
04:34:36.910 --> 04:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
fire safety perspective I hear other
 
04:34:38.750 --> 04:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
than the time and the the resources it
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
takes is the when you put it in a you
 
04:34:43.390 --> 04:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
know in a parking garage that has an
 
04:34:46.230 --> 04:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
apartment building above it um and you
 
04:34:48.150 --> 04:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
know that where go back to it takes a
 
04:34:49.910 --> 04:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
few minutes to put a regular internal
 
04:34:52.189 --> 04:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
combustion engine vehicle out where this
 
04:34:54.070 --> 04:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
go back to you know potentially IA put
 
04:34:56.551 --> 04:34:56.561 align:start position:0%
an EV fire out is the structural
 
04:34:57.910 --> 04:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
protection between the residential and
 
04:35:00.150 --> 04:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
the commercial space okay um is the
 
04:35:01.830 --> 04:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
sprinkler system capable of doing it
 
04:35:03.349 --> 04:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
there's some research now saying if you
 
04:35:05.869 --> 04:35:05.879 align:start position:0%
bump the design capacity of the of the
 
04:35:07.789 --> 04:35:07.799 align:start position:0%
sprinkler system for that residential up
 
04:35:10.629 --> 04:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
one category above what it is now that's
 
04:35:12.029 --> 04:35:12.039 align:start position:0%
going to help protect the structure and
 
04:35:13.990 --> 04:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
help protect the cars around it so I
 
04:35:16.230 --> 04:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
really think we're in a research mode um
 
04:35:18.830 --> 04:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
you know but I I think that uh you know
 
04:35:20.670 --> 04:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
I go back to let's focus on the study
 
04:35:23.830 --> 04:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
and not just say no right um it's going
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
to take a little bit of time to figure
 
04:35:27.789 --> 04:35:27.799 align:start position:0%
out that uh transition from horse and
 
04:35:30.029 --> 04:35:30.039 align:start position:0%
buggy to internal combustion and now to
 
04:35:32.189 --> 04:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
these EVS but uh they're making fire
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
engines that are EVS right now so I mean
 
04:35:36.910 --> 04:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
it's you know uh concern we heard
 
04:35:38.470 --> 04:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
recently is that you know that the
 
04:35:40.189 --> 04:35:40.199 align:start position:0%
propane delivery trucks for our homes if
 
04:35:41.869 --> 04:35:41.879 align:start position:0%
we have Propane fuel they're making
 
04:35:43.990 --> 04:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
those EVs and the people are kind of
 
04:35:45.390 --> 04:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
very concerned about that you know if
 
04:35:47.709 --> 04:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
you put a propane tank sitting above a
 
04:35:49.230 --> 04:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
some electric batteries well there's got
 
04:35:50.349 --> 04:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
to if they're making them there's got to
 
04:35:51.709 --> 04:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
be some protection we got we got to
 
04:35:52.990 --> 04:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
figure this out so we just need some
 
04:35:57.150 --> 04:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
time thank you represent ffi
 
04:36:00.230 --> 04:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
please yes just pull that your mic a
 
04:36:01.629 --> 04:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
little closer to you
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
sir there hello yeah
 
04:36:08.869 --> 04:36:08.879 align:start position:0%
on TV about three weeks ago there was
 
04:36:08.879 --> 04:36:10.830 align:start position:0%
on TV about three weeks ago there was
some

04:36:10.830 --> 04:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:36:13.910 --> 04:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
agency I don't remember the name they
 
04:36:17.150 --> 04:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
said it takes 3600 gallons of water to
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
put out a fire on an
 
04:36:21.910 --> 04:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
EV have you heard anything about that
 
04:36:23.830 --> 04:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
there's all over the place there's that
 
04:36:25.869 --> 04:36:25.879 align:start position:0%
amount to tens of thousands of gallons
 
04:36:29.910 --> 04:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
of water um you know so it is it's all
 
04:36:31.349 --> 04:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
over the place there's stories of people
 
04:36:32.910 --> 04:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
getting trapped in the back seats of EVs
 
04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
and dying and but we we can't find that
 
04:36:36.789 --> 04:36:36.799 align:start position:0%
data and that that's I think my biggest
 
04:36:38.029 --> 04:36:38.039 align:start position:0%
concern is that if we're going to make
 
04:36:40.189 --> 04:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
decisions on on these things we need to
 
04:36:41.910 --> 04:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
have good factual data that can be
 
04:36:44.949 --> 04:36:44.959 align:start position:0%
verified um and not just make sort of
 
04:36:48.949 --> 04:36:48.959 align:start position:0%
knee-jerk reactions to to uh to rules
 
04:36:52.029 --> 04:36:52.039 align:start position:0%
and regulations around on stuff thank
 
04:36:55.070 --> 04:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
you further yes representative
 
04:36:57.670 --> 04:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
Boger uh thank you for taking my
 
04:36:57.680 --> 04:36:59.629 align:start position:0%
Boger uh thank you for taking my
question

04:36:59.629 --> 04:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:37:03.269 --> 04:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
um in your statement you mentioned that
 
04:37:07.470 --> 04:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
when you put an EV in a parking garage
 
04:37:08.590 --> 04:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
that has
 
04:37:13.470 --> 04:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
residential uh housing above it that you
 
04:37:15.830 --> 04:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
might have to add to the cost of the
 
04:37:20.510 --> 04:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
construction of this units in order to
 
04:37:25.390 --> 04:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
incorporate the use of EV EVs and I'm
 
04:37:28.310 --> 04:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
just curious in a climate of where we're
 
04:37:32.551 --> 04:37:32.561 align:start position:0%
trying to lower the price of housing but
 
04:37:36.349 --> 04:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
yet to accommodate an electric vehicle
 
04:37:36.359 --> 04:37:37.150 align:start position:0%
yet to accommodate an electric vehicle
we

04:37:37.150 --> 04:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:37:40.189 --> 04:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
find everywhere we turn we're increasing
 
04:37:43.349 --> 04:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
the price of everything else around it
 
04:37:46.830 --> 04:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
in order to accommodate an EV am am I
 
04:37:49.990 --> 04:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
going down the wrong track here or I I I
 
04:37:51.230 --> 04:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
think that's something we're trying to
 
04:37:52.869 --> 04:37:52.879 align:start position:0%
look at and I think the other thing is
 
04:37:54.709 --> 04:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
you know go back to that UL study that I
 
04:37:56.830 --> 04:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned they're they're looking at did
 
04:37:58.750 --> 04:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
was there a change from metal components
 
04:38:00.910 --> 04:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
to plastic components and like so what's
 
04:38:02.349 --> 04:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
different what's the differential
 
04:38:05.629 --> 04:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
between those two so I don't
 
04:38:07.109 --> 04:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
personally I want to wait for the the
 
04:38:08.869 --> 04:38:08.879 align:start position:0%
studies to come out before I make that
 
04:38:13.230 --> 04:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
hard and fast decision um but um we know
 
04:38:15.189 --> 04:38:15.199 align:start position:0%
that a metal all metal vehicle is very
 
04:38:16.590 --> 04:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
different than a plastic vehicle and we
 
04:38:18.349 --> 04:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
know it's different if a battery get if
 
04:38:20.551 --> 04:38:20.561 align:start position:0%
if and when a battery gets involved so
 
04:38:21.949 --> 04:38:21.959 align:start position:0%
there's there's different risk and that
 
04:38:24.429 --> 04:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
may imply there's a cost
 
04:38:27.670 --> 04:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
difference thank you uh representative
 
04:38:27.680 --> 04:38:28.869 align:start position:0%
difference thank you uh representative
Connor

04:38:28.869 --> 04:38:28.879 align:start position:0%
Connor
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
please excuse me represent melin thank
 
04:38:36.470 --> 04:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you for let me thank you for
 
04:38:38.869 --> 04:38:38.879 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh have you talked to
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
the Automobile Association the toen
 
04:38:44.070 --> 04:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
association about when these cars get in
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
an accident and they haven't caught fire
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
yet but you put it on the back of your
 
04:38:52.789 --> 04:38:52.799 align:start position:0%
flatbed and it catches on fire have you
 
04:38:55.390 --> 04:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
had any discussion about that yes sir
 
04:38:56.910 --> 04:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
they they were part of the discussion we
 
04:38:58.109 --> 04:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
brought together this summer and they've
 
04:38:59.750 --> 04:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
been part of the three meetings that
 
04:39:03.390 --> 04:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
we've had so far um some of them are are
 
04:39:04.590 --> 04:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
recommending just putting them in a
 
04:39:06.789 --> 04:39:06.799 align:start position:0%
different spot in their yards or put in
 
04:39:08.709 --> 04:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
like Jersey barriers or something like
 
04:39:10.429 --> 04:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
that block the block big concrete blocks
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
to help protect them and segregate them
 
04:39:14.349 --> 04:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
for 30 to 90 days and that's still
 
04:39:15.429 --> 04:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
something they're trying to figure out
 
04:39:17.390 --> 04:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
the time frame for but yes they they
 
04:39:19.390 --> 04:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
both have been included dealers Auto
 
04:39:22.189 --> 04:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
automo deal automobile dealers sorry and
 
04:39:22.199 --> 04:39:23.230 align:start position:0%
automo deal automobile dealers sorry and
the

04:39:23.230 --> 04:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:26.910 --> 04:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
toe uh but have they has any one of them
 
04:39:29.869 --> 04:39:29.879 align:start position:0%
turned around and said I won't tell that
 
04:39:31.990 --> 04:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is yes but I can't I
 
04:39:34.869 --> 04:39:34.879 align:start position:0%
can't give you an example um and
 
04:39:37.109 --> 04:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
thoroughly we've heard that happen but I
 
04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
can't tell you today in a specific
 
04:39:41.550 --> 04:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
example of that okay thank you further
 
04:39:43.830 --> 04:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
questions yes
 
04:39:46.230 --> 04:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:39:50.510 --> 04:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question Pon I AP Peterson I
 
04:39:53.310 --> 04:39:53.320 align:start position:0%
apologize are you aware of
 
04:39:56.110 --> 04:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
um alternative batteries to lithium
 
04:39:57.708 --> 04:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
batteries such as the solid state
 
04:39:59.510 --> 04:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
batteries and sodium batteries do they
 
04:40:02.430 --> 04:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
have the same intense fire hazards that
 
04:40:04.510 --> 04:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
the lithium batteries have we're being
 
04:40:07.510 --> 04:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
told no um and we're being told there's
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
some stuff coming out on the lithium ion
 
04:40:11.270 --> 04:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
batteries to change the science of those
 
04:40:13.708 --> 04:40:13.718 align:start position:0%
to make them less of a uh risk for
 
04:40:14.990 --> 04:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
thermal runaway but they're not
 
04:40:17.110 --> 04:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
available is my understanding that part
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
of it yet but it's coming thank you
 
04:40:21.910 --> 04:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
04:40:26.230 --> 04:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes Mr CH uh yes uh thank
 
04:40:29.030 --> 04:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
you uh do you have any records or is
 
04:40:31.070 --> 04:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
your office now or encouraging
 
04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities to keep records on carire
 
04:40:36.550 --> 04:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
vehicle fires and whether they're
 
04:40:39.030 --> 04:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles versus non-electrical
 
04:40:40.948 --> 04:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
Vehicles any sort of Statistics that you
 
04:40:43.910 --> 04:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
started collecting uh yes sir we uh this
 
04:40:45.830 --> 04:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
summer we started asking the fire chiefs
 
04:40:47.430 --> 04:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
Through the Fire Chiefs Association some
 
04:40:49.070 --> 04:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
email blasts that we've had we stood up
 
04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
a small little quick survey for battery
 
04:40:54.470 --> 04:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
fires car and car fires uh we've only
 
04:40:56.550 --> 04:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
gotten one response so far and that was
 
04:40:58.470 --> 04:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
a the lithium am battery it wasn't a
 
04:41:00.750 --> 04:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
vehical related one uh but yes we are
 
04:41:03.788 --> 04:41:03.798 align:start position:0%
the in the the US fire Administration is
 
04:41:05.750 --> 04:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
undertaking a a major change in the
 
04:41:07.230 --> 04:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
collection of fire data across the
 
04:41:09.750 --> 04:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
country right now and I I suspect that
 
04:41:11.030 --> 04:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
um they're working on the framework of
 
04:41:13.470 --> 04:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
that at the moment but uh at the our our
 
04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
current incident reporting system at the
 
04:41:17.590 --> 04:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
state isn't sufficient to dive into that
 
04:41:20.390 --> 04:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
level um so that's why we stood up that
 
04:41:22.990 --> 04:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
that uh separate survey tool follow up
 
04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh do you know of any other
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
states that are keeping in statistics
 
04:41:30.310 --> 04:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
especially our neighbors or other states
 
04:41:32.510 --> 04:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
where if you wanted to compare we or we
 
04:41:35.708 --> 04:41:35.718 align:start position:0%
could compare uh so so far the probably
 
04:41:37.350 --> 04:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
the best one that's looking at data is
 
04:41:39.350 --> 04:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
New York um and they're looking more at
 
04:41:42.788 --> 04:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
the e-mobility type devices um is my
 
04:41:44.470 --> 04:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
understanding Maryland I believe started
 
04:41:46.470 --> 04:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
doing a study I haven't checked with
 
04:41:50.230 --> 04:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
others but is um it is it's been part of
 
04:41:51.830 --> 04:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
a conversation to try to collect the
 
04:41:54.868 --> 04:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
data I think the the hold outs we being
 
04:41:56.990 --> 04:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
told is the new nearest system which is
 
04:41:59.230 --> 04:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
part of the emergency Reporting System
 
04:42:00.350 --> 04:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
that's coming out from us fire
 
04:42:02.270 --> 04:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
Administration should hopefully be sted
 
04:42:03.788 --> 04:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
up by the end of this year we're hoping
 
04:42:05.590 --> 04:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
that it will capture data so I think
 
04:42:08.430 --> 04:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
some people kind of holding back without
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
having to create whole separate Data
 
04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
Systems um since there's a new one in
 
04:42:16.868 --> 04:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
the in the Works near near pretty close
 
04:42:18.788 --> 04:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any further
 
04:42:21.350 --> 04:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
questions I have I have a question
 
04:42:23.430 --> 04:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
number one I applaud you and every
 
04:42:25.788 --> 04:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
fireman throughout our state throughout
 
04:42:27.628 --> 04:42:27.638 align:start position:0%
the country wonderful
 
04:42:33.390 --> 04:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
job my my question is um what's before
 
04:42:36.310 --> 04:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
us 1510 is establish a commission
 
04:42:39.390 --> 04:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
identify barriers to and solutions for
 
04:42:41.030 --> 04:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
sales it would appear to me as you being
 
04:42:46.590 --> 04:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
a member or someone being appointed to
 
04:42:46.600 --> 04:42:47.628 align:start position:0%
a member or someone being appointed to
that

04:42:47.628 --> 04:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:51.788 --> 04:42:51.798 align:start position:0%
commission the the barrier to uh sales
 
04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
is the battery that runs the vehicle we
 
04:42:59.990 --> 04:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
we know that where where do you see do
 
04:43:01.868 --> 04:43:01.878 align:start position:0%
you see other
 
04:43:05.550 --> 04:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
barriers um that would be help ful in in
 
04:43:08.510 --> 04:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
a commission I I thank you and I I think
 
04:43:10.230 --> 04:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
the the focus for us at the fire
 
04:43:11.948 --> 04:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
Marshall's office is the fire safety
 
04:43:13.868 --> 04:43:13.878 align:start position:0%
concerns I know there's other a bunch of
 
04:43:15.830 --> 04:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
others that you know as representative
 
04:43:16.948 --> 04:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
MC Williams talked about some of the
 
04:43:18.948 --> 04:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
climate stuff and some of the things
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
that I I'm not I haven't studied that
 
04:43:22.628 --> 04:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
side of it I really focused on the fire
 
04:43:25.550 --> 04:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
side um and I think that we want to
 
04:43:28.110 --> 04:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
focus on you know looking at other
 
04:43:31.628 --> 04:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
battery uh Technologies um and trying to
 
04:43:33.670 --> 04:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
help you know like the tow Association
 
04:43:36.110 --> 04:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
how do you you know those those sorts of
 
04:43:38.910 --> 04:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
things to understand you know if if it's
 
04:43:40.670 --> 04:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
towed how do you protect it if it's in a
 
04:43:42.150 --> 04:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
garage how do you protect it if it's on
 
04:43:43.510 --> 04:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
the side of one of our Interstate
 
04:43:45.868 --> 04:43:45.878 align:start position:0%
systems or you know something like that
 
04:43:47.868 --> 04:43:47.878 align:start position:0%
like how does a fire department respond
 
04:43:49.190 --> 04:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
to it so we want I think we want to
 
04:43:50.750 --> 04:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
approach it from an educational
 
04:43:52.590 --> 04:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
perspective okay um and just get that

Wilcox to testify once again before our
 
04:44:05.708 --> 04:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
committee welcome to Public Works and
 
04:44:08.350 --> 04:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
highways thank you very much chair and
 
04:44:10.230 --> 04:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:44:12.550 --> 04:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
I'm Jessica Wilcox I'm the mobile
 
04:44:14.110 --> 04:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
sources supervisor over at the New
 
04:44:15.390 --> 04:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
04:44:18.070 --> 04:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
Services and our team is is overseeing
 
04:44:20.310 --> 04:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
the Volkswagen settlement funding um
 
04:44:22.390 --> 04:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
which we're spending uh a big portion on
 
04:44:24.030 --> 04:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
the buildout of electric vehicle
 
04:44:26.230 --> 04:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
charging infrastructure in the state and
 
04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
we were also um a participant in the
 
04:44:30.510 --> 04:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
round table that the fire chief has
 
04:44:33.628 --> 04:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
referred to we take no position on this
 
04:44:35.390 --> 04:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
bill but we wanted to bring to your
 
04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
attention that there were several EV or
 
04:44:40.190 --> 04:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle related bills being
 
04:44:43.390 --> 04:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
proposed in the house this session two
 
04:44:45.030 --> 04:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
of them were in transportation and two
 
04:44:47.470 --> 04:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
of them in the executive departments in
 
04:44:49.868 --> 04:44:49.878 align:start position:0%
administration so far one of those bills
 
04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
has been referred to interim study two
 
04:44:55.230 --> 04:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
of those bills were voted inexpedient to
 
04:44:57.470 --> 04:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
legislate and for the bill that has not
 
04:45:00.190 --> 04:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
yet been voted on which addresses Pro
 
04:45:01.628 --> 04:45:01.638 align:start position:0%
prohibiting electric vehicles and
 
04:45:04.590 --> 04:45:04.600 align:start position:0%
parking garages we did testify and
 
04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
recommend that the committee consider
 
04:45:08.390 --> 04:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
referring it to interim study as
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
well um there's a lot that needs to be
 
04:45:14.150 --> 04:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
researched as uh the Fire Marshall
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned having factual data and real
 
04:45:19.628 --> 04:45:19.638 align:start position:0%
world data to clarify you know what are
 
04:45:22.750 --> 04:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
the concerns what are the barriers um
 
04:45:24.750 --> 04:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
definitions operations procedures these
 
04:45:26.550 --> 04:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
are all things that need to be discussed
 
04:45:29.350 --> 04:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
and and dealt with um through more time
 
04:45:33.190 --> 04:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
and more um and more attention now there
 
04:45:34.390 --> 04:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
are actually two bills that would would
 
04:45:35.788 --> 04:45:35.798 align:start position:0%
create study committees which the
 
04:45:38.070 --> 04:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor did reference this bill and then
 
04:45:40.628 --> 04:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 430 um which the Senate
 
04:45:42.910 --> 04:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation committee voted ought to
 
04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
pass and both of these bills would could
 
04:45:47.350 --> 04:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
be potential we see them as potential
 
04:45:49.310 --> 04:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
vehicles for addressing a lot of these
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
concerns and issues that are being
 
04:45:53.150 --> 04:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
raised so uh we like the idea that if
 
04:45:54.750 --> 04:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
those bills could be matched together
 
04:45:57.030 --> 04:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
through that reconciliation process that
 
04:46:00.430 --> 04:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
seems to be a good a good path forward
 
04:46:02.430 --> 04:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
both of those bills also list several of
 
04:46:04.430 --> 04:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
the same members including the New
 
04:46:05.590 --> 04:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Environmental
 
04:46:07.628 --> 04:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
Services and as we have been
 
04:46:09.550 --> 04:46:09.560 align:start position:0%
participating in discussions up till now
 
04:46:12.590 --> 04:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
we are happy and pleased to continue
 
04:46:14.430 --> 04:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
those discussions and to serve as a
 
04:46:16.670 --> 04:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
resource to you all because we have been
 
04:46:18.750 --> 04:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
uh working on this for for a long time
 
04:46:21.470 --> 04:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
and recent DMV data is showing that so
 
04:46:23.350 --> 04:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
far in New Hampshire we're seeing 10,000
 
04:46:25.390 --> 04:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles on the road so we're
 
04:46:28.030 --> 04:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
seeing that growth these are coming so
 
04:46:29.590 --> 04:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
lot a lot of work to be done that's all
 
04:46:30.910 --> 04:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
I have thank you so much for your time
 
04:46:32.350 --> 04:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions from ad
 
04:46:35.628 --> 04:46:35.638 align:start position:0%
will Cox represent CL uh yes you said
 
04:46:37.990 --> 04:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
there are now 10,000 electric vehicles
 
04:46:40.190 --> 04:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
on the road in our state registered
 
04:46:43.030 --> 04:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
registered okay do you have like and
 
04:46:44.910 --> 04:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
what what was it let's say two or three
 
04:46:46.990 --> 04:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
years ago do you have any data on that
 
04:46:49.230 --> 04:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
if memory serves I think a few years
 
04:46:51.510 --> 04:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
back we were at about 6,000 we're seeing
 
04:46:53.990 --> 04:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
like a 15% growth on average
 
04:46:56.788 --> 04:46:56.798 align:start position:0%
year-over-year okay so you expect follow
 
04:47:00.590 --> 04:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
up CL a 15% growth let's say next year
 
04:47:02.070 --> 04:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
and the year after is that what you're
 
04:47:03.750 --> 04:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
saying so that was kind of how we were
 
04:47:05.150 --> 04:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
looking at initially when we looked at
 
04:47:08.110 --> 04:47:08.120 align:start position:0%
that data but um ISO New England who
 
04:47:10.190 --> 04:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
operates the regional electric grid in
 
04:47:11.510 --> 04:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
the area has actually done some
 
04:47:14.788 --> 04:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
forecasts and per their forecast they
 
04:47:17.110 --> 04:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
are projecting that by
 
04:47:20.590 --> 04:47:20.600 align:start position:0%
2031 we should see 140,000 electric
 
04:47:22.470 --> 04:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles on the road and that is broken
 
04:47:25.990 --> 04:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
down by year I think by 2025 they pro
 
04:47:27.990 --> 04:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
project 30,000 electric vehicles on the
 
04:47:31.548 --> 04:47:31.558 align:start position:0%
road in New Hampshire all okay thank you
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you further
 
04:47:33.480 --> 04:47:35.788 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you further
questions

04:47:35.788 --> 04:47:35.798 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:47:37.708 --> 04:47:37.718 align:start position:0%
yes please thank you Mr chairman thank
 
04:47:39.390 --> 04:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question it in that
 
04:47:41.590 --> 04:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
10,000 number does that include hybrids
 
04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
and plug-in hybrids that's correct
 
04:47:45.270 --> 04:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
that's not all battery electric that
 
04:47:46.750 --> 04:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
includes the plug-in Hy electric
 
04:47:49.548 --> 04:47:49.558 align:start position:0%
vehicles not the standard hybrids that
 
04:47:54.430 --> 04:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
don't plug into charge thank you further
 
04:47:59.868 --> 04:47:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
testimony um that is that concludes that
 
04:48:05.110 --> 04:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
concludes what I have for pin cards was
 
04:48:06.788 --> 04:48:06.798 align:start position:0%
there anything else the sponsor wanted
 
04:48:09.868 --> 04:48:09.878 align:start position:0%
to mention or anyone that has spoken
 
04:48:12.030 --> 04:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
previous or would you like to come
 
04:48:15.310 --> 04:48:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:17.110 --> 04:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much for the
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity um I understand you're going
 
04:48:21.750 --> 04:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
to be executing this bill today we may
 
04:48:23.070 --> 04:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
okay you may be executing this bill
 
04:48:25.708 --> 04:48:25.718 align:start position:0%
today um in the to the extent that there
 
04:48:27.390 --> 04:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
may need to be an amendment I would be
 
04:48:29.190 --> 04:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
happy to do an amendment if you need to
 
04:48:31.548 --> 04:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
bump the exec I'm flexible I I think
 
04:48:34.070 --> 04:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
that this is worth studying um also I do
 
04:48:36.470 --> 04:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
want to mention I know my colleague from
 
04:48:38.350 --> 04:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
Dees didn't mention that there was one
 
04:48:42.110 --> 04:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
more EV V bill at st&amp; which uh was exec
 
04:48:44.670 --> 04:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday it was a tie 1010 so I don't
 
04:48:45.948 --> 04:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
expect we're going to see much more
 
04:48:48.590 --> 04:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
traction on that bill but um that was a
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
cash on the hoods uh it's not 10,000 or
 
04:48:54.350 --> 04:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
20 sorry $1,000 or $2,000 cash on the
 
04:48:56.548 --> 04:48:56.558 align:start position:0%
hoods um using Reggie funds for a
 
04:48:58.590 --> 04:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
two-year pilot we'll see if that goes
 
04:49:00.830 --> 04:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
anywhere but that bill uh was exact
 
04:49:03.670 --> 04:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday at St um so I'm happy to
 
04:49:04.910 --> 04:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
answer other questions that may have
 
04:49:06.590 --> 04:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
come up since the last time I spoke it's
 
04:49:08.708 --> 04:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
a pleasure to be in front of you would
 
04:49:10.948 --> 04:49:10.958 align:start position:0%
you take a question from the chair of
 
04:49:15.868 --> 04:49:15.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:19.470 --> 04:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
you commissions are are are a hard thing
 
04:49:21.070 --> 04:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
to pull together right now in the
 
04:49:23.070 --> 04:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
climate especially a three-year
 
04:49:24.590 --> 04:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
commission and the cost of
 
04:49:26.548 --> 04:49:26.558 align:start position:0%
Representatives seem to like to be paid
 
04:49:28.868 --> 04:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
when they show up to come to a
 
04:49:33.150 --> 04:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
commission would do do you foresee you'd
 
04:49:35.628 --> 04:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
mentioned and if I'm out of line you
 
04:49:38.708 --> 04:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
please tell me you mentioned that one of
 
04:49:42.390 --> 04:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
your concerns is a federal issue uh that
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
is tied to the State issue because we
 
04:49:48.350 --> 04:49:48.360 align:start position:0%
won't come to that uh particulate amount
 
04:49:51.910 --> 04:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
that triggers getting more units in here
 
04:49:55.230 --> 04:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
would you consider somehow making this a
 
04:49:58.070 --> 04:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
committee do you foresee that as opposed
 
04:50:01.110 --> 04:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
to being a commission a working group or
 
04:50:02.628 --> 04:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
some other
 
04:50:05.310 --> 04:50:05.320 align:start position:0%
form or are you looking to have the
 
04:50:07.670 --> 04:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
weight of the commission I'm just asking
 
04:50:10.430 --> 04:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
you to think about that as you as you go
 
04:50:10.440 --> 04:50:12.350 align:start position:0%
you to think about that as you as you go
forward

04:50:12.350 --> 04:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:50:14.910 --> 04:50:14.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question chair I
 
04:50:17.070 --> 04:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
hadn't really considered that until this
 
04:50:21.390 --> 04:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
moment um so I'm digesting it I think
 
04:50:23.750 --> 04:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
that if it were a committee it would
 
04:50:26.350 --> 04:50:26.360 align:start position:0%
still need some time to actually come to
 
04:50:29.350 --> 04:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
to a data driven conclusion and I think
 
04:50:30.830 --> 04:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
the committee would want to be able to
 
04:50:33.270 --> 04:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
call upon the members of the commission
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
that were list Ed in the amendment in
 
04:50:39.670 --> 04:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
order to get testimony and data um so
 
04:50:42.310 --> 04:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
whether the members of the commission as
 
04:50:44.910 --> 04:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
written right now were truly
 
04:50:47.948 --> 04:50:47.958 align:start position:0%
participants or simply attendees who
 
04:50:50.990 --> 04:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
could speak up I think we would probably
 
04:50:53.788 --> 04:50:53.798 align:start position:0%
come to the same conclusions eventually
 
04:50:56.350 --> 04:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
so thinking this through I do not
 
04:50:57.708 --> 04:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
believe that the makeup between
 
04:51:00.510 --> 04:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
committee or commission is really that
 
04:51:02.868 --> 04:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
important and I'm certainly not wedded
 
04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
to it I think the goal is to come up
 
04:51:08.070 --> 04:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
with answers and data so that we can
 
04:51:09.868 --> 04:51:09.878 align:start position:0%
move forward as a state one more
 
04:51:11.830 --> 04:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
question and I apologize for not knowing
 
04:51:13.310 --> 04:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
your background what committee do you
 
04:51:15.230 --> 04:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
are you a member of I'm on science
 
04:51:17.190 --> 04:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
technology and energy I'm an architect
 
04:51:20.030 --> 04:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
and attorney and of course the State Rep
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
so you're busy I'm busy thank you you're
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
welome any further questions yes
 
04:51:28.750 --> 04:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
please Peterson thank you Mr chair I
 
04:51:31.628 --> 04:51:31.638 align:start position:0%
have one more technical question for you
 
04:51:34.788 --> 04:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
concerning the EVS uh with the extreme
 
04:51:36.830 --> 04:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
heavy weight of the batteries has there
 
04:51:39.270 --> 04:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
been much talk about the
 
04:51:42.430 --> 04:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
uh wear and tear on the tires and wear
 
04:51:44.510 --> 04:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
and tear on the roads especially in hot
 
04:51:46.230 --> 04:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
climates where the tires wear out
 
04:51:48.150 --> 04:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
quickly and the roads get torn up
 
04:51:51.030 --> 04:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
because uh the asphalt is soft and the
 
04:51:53.110 --> 04:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
cars are extremely
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
heavy um I'm not privy to that specific
 
04:51:59.430 --> 04:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
discussion in terms of hot climate
 
04:52:03.230 --> 04:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
asphalt and tires um but I will tell you
 
04:52:05.750 --> 04:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
that everything old is new again and
 
04:52:07.230 --> 04:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
certainly we were having the same
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
conversations Generations back when we
 
04:52:11.350 --> 04:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
were converting from horse and buggy to
 
04:52:13.590 --> 04:52:13.600 align:start position:0%
internal combustion engine in terms of
 
04:52:16.350 --> 04:52:16.360 align:start position:0%
deciding to pave our roads and do
 
04:52:18.830 --> 04:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
highways across the country and so we're
 
04:52:20.548 --> 04:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
we're probably there again in terms of
 
04:52:22.750 --> 04:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
changes with Tire makeup and potentially
 
04:52:24.830 --> 04:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
Road surfaces as well we'll see time
 
04:52:26.830 --> 04:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
will tell but everything old is new
 
04:52:29.310 --> 04:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
again thank you you're welcome um and if
 
04:52:31.470 --> 04:52:31.480 align:start position:0%
I could just mention chair I would be
 
04:52:32.990 --> 04:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
willing to serve on a committee or a
 
04:52:34.590 --> 04:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
commission this is really important to
 
04:52:37.470 --> 04:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
me okay thank you thank I I thank you I
 
04:52:39.948 --> 04:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate yours and and all that have
 
04:52:43.670 --> 04:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
attended thank you we will uh if there's
 
04:52:45.788 --> 04:52:45.798 align:start position:0%
no other no one else wishing to testify
 
04:52:49.230 --> 04:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
at this point in time we will call to a
 
04:52:51.948 --> 04:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
close uh House Bill
 
04:52:54.670 --> 04:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
1510 and with the included Amendment
 
04:52:54.680 --> 04:52:57.750 align:start position:0%
1510 and with the included Amendment
thank

04:52:57.750 --> 04:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:02.548 --> 04:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:02.558 --> 04:53:32.110 align:start position:0%
 
sheet

04:53:32.110 --> 04:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:34.590 --> 04:53:34.600 align:start position:0%
point of order Mr chairman yes would it
 
04:53:38.110 --> 04:53:38.120 align:start position:0%
be possible to have a very brief recess
 
04:53:40.590 --> 04:53:40.600 align:start position:0%
before reconvening and I'm presuming
 
04:53:41.830 --> 04:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
that you're going to suggest that we go
 
04:53:49.430 --> 04:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:52.350 --> 04:53:52.360 align:start position:0%
you our committee will be in recess for
 
04:53:54.990 --> 04:53:55.000 align:start position:0%
the next 20 minutes at which time we
 
04:53:58.910 --> 04:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
will come back together and we have a
 
04:54:00.708 --> 04:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
list of bills whether we get through
 
04:54:02.868 --> 04:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
that or not but that's where we're going
 
04:54:05.990 --> 04:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
to go I would ask the
 
04:54:09.470 --> 04:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
Republicans uh to move to our empty
 
04:54:12.070 --> 04:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
Ballroom which used to be our office
 
04:54:13.548 --> 04:54:13.558 align:start position:0%
okay so it's all right we caucus it
 
04:54:13.558 --> 04:54:32.470 align:start position:0%
okay so it's all right we caucus it

04:54:32.470 --> 04:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:32.480 --> 05:27:20.350 align:start position:0%
 
is

05:27:20.350 --> 05:27:20.360 align:start position:0%

05:30:56.750 --> 05:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the motion I can speak
 
05:30:58.350 --> 05:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
briefly yes please I would like to thank
 
05:31:02.110 --> 05:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
you uh we passed RSA 20 31 81a in
 
05:31:04.750 --> 05:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
2019 uh to handle private roads the
 
05:31:06.708 --> 05:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
problem being you couldn't get certain
 
05:31:08.830 --> 05:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
types of federally guaranteed mortgages
 
05:31:13.548 --> 05:31:13.558 align:start position:0%
on private roads and uh it was a it was
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
a compromise bill it took about three
 
05:31:18.190 --> 05:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
years to pass every word of it is
 
05:31:20.788 --> 05:31:20.798 align:start position:0%
carefully crafted to satisfy all the
 
05:31:23.628 --> 05:31:23.638 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um this bill would have
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
extended those same protections to class
 
05:31:28.110 --> 05:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
six roads which are unmaintained public
 
05:31:31.670 --> 05:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
roads uh and but we learn that there is
 
05:31:33.990 --> 05:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
no problem getting mortgages on class 6
 
05:31:37.310 --> 05:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
roads so the original uh problem doesn't
 
05:31:40.628 --> 05:31:40.638 align:start position:0%
come up and uh we only had testimony in
 
05:31:43.390 --> 05:31:43.400 align:start position:0%
favor of it from one citizen uh some
 
05:31:46.548 --> 05:31:46.558 align:start position:0%
stakeholders were opposed because uh
 
05:31:49.948 --> 05:31:49.958 align:start position:0%
without the mortgage incentive uh they
 
05:31:52.670 --> 05:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
were unhappy with the tension between
 
05:31:55.548 --> 05:31:55.558 align:start position:0%
what does what does what what does
 
05:31:58.270 --> 05:31:58.280 align:start position:0%
equitably mean in terms of funding the
 
05:32:00.270 --> 05:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
maintenance depending on how you are
 
05:32:02.230 --> 05:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
using the property and where your
 
05:32:04.708 --> 05:32:04.718 align:start position:0%
Frontage is and whether you're using it
 
05:32:08.670 --> 05:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
seasonally or year round so uh and it
 
05:32:10.430 --> 05:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
was pointed out that one possibility
 
05:32:12.230 --> 05:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
would be to convince the town to
 
05:32:13.990 --> 05:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
discontinue the road then it would be a
 
05:32:16.670 --> 05:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
private road and and this wouldn't come
 
05:32:19.868 --> 05:32:19.878 align:start position:0%
up so um I would also point out I have
 
05:32:22.110 --> 05:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this the problem the
 
05:32:24.548 --> 05:32:24.558 align:start position:0%
there's a severe drafting error in the
 
05:32:27.948 --> 05:32:27.958 align:start position:0%
in the as introduced version of the bill
 
05:32:30.310 --> 05:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
so if we should get to a split split
 
05:32:34.628 --> 05:32:34.638 align:start position:0%
vote uh where we where there's an OTP
 
05:32:36.910 --> 05:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
possibility we have to make sure that
 
05:32:39.430 --> 05:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
this bill does not come out with a bare
 
05:32:43.628 --> 05:32:43.638 align:start position:0%
OTP so if if we should get a split vote
 
05:32:46.590 --> 05:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh we will need a a Minority Report with
 
05:32:49.670 --> 05:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
that as a as an amendment thank you
 
05:32:52.628 --> 05:32:52.638 align:start position:0%
representative Jack yes that amendment's
 
05:32:56.510 --> 05:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
already been drafted correct okay we
 
05:32:58.708 --> 05:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
don't need it so right if if we get to
 
05:33:00.350 --> 05:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
the floor you have something that to
 
05:33:01.590 --> 05:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
offer I
 
05:33:06.750 --> 05:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
guess could be yep thank you any further
 
05:33:11.070 --> 05:33:11.080 align:start position:0%

traffic signal at the intersection of
 
05:35:07.350 --> 05:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
Route 111 and Elmer Road in

move itl on House Bill
 
05:35:20.470 --> 05:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
1262 motion's been made SEC seconded by
 
05:35:23.788 --> 05:35:23.798 align:start position:0%
Mills um
 
05:35:26.910 --> 05:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
discussion u i will F I'll first go to
 
05:35:29.750 --> 05:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
um to represent clud I tried to listen
 
05:35:31.868 --> 05:35:31.878 align:start position:0%
take notes during the testimony and just
 
05:35:35.030 --> 05:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
that do is recommending a
 
05:35:37.708 --> 05:35:37.718 align:start position:0%
roundabout uh and I mean the the
 
05:35:39.750 --> 05:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
signalized according to the testimony
 
05:35:45.110 --> 05:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
isn't in the 10-year plan so it I I I if
 
05:35:46.830 --> 05:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
they want to signalize I don't know
 
05:35:48.708 --> 05:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
maybe you ought to come and ask for
 
05:35:50.230 --> 05:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the 10year plan but I don't
 
05:35:52.910 --> 05:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
think this bill is the way to go because
 
05:35:56.590 --> 05:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
we try as much as we can to to respect
 
05:35:59.150 --> 05:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
the process of the 10-year plan and so
 
05:36:02.670 --> 05:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
that's why urge itl on House Bill 1262
 
05:36:04.470 --> 05:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
represent Mills do you have a
 
05:36:07.030 --> 05:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
comment yeah if I could just oh yeah
 
05:36:09.110 --> 05:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
represent back yeah we also learned that
 
05:36:10.628 --> 05:36:10.638 align:start position:0%
the this particular intersection does
 
05:36:12.590 --> 05:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
not satisfy the signal warrants for a
 
05:36:15.390 --> 05:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
traffic signal so one cannot be built at
 
05:36:15.400 --> 05:36:17.110 align:start position:0%
traffic signal so one cannot be built at
that

05:36:17.110 --> 05:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:36:20.310 --> 05:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
intersection thank you further and
 
05:36:22.110 --> 05:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
representative Mills agrees with the
 
05:36:25.948 --> 05:36:25.958 align:start position:0%
previous two Representatives thank
 
05:36:28.948 --> 05:36:28.958 align:start position:0%
you R boy thank you Mr chairman Mr
 
05:36:30.548 --> 05:36:30.558 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm going to be opposing itl
 
05:36:33.110 --> 05:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
for the simple fact that it's the it's
 
05:36:36.830 --> 05:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
desirous of the town of s to have a
 
05:36:39.430 --> 05:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
signalized um structure at that
 
05:36:42.230 --> 05:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
particular intersection it was not clear
 
05:36:44.948 --> 05:36:44.958 align:start position:0%
to me that an analysis had been done
 
05:36:47.430 --> 05:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
whether to justify a signal at that
 
05:36:49.548 --> 05:36:49.558 align:start position:0%
intersection or not I would have
 
05:36:51.150 --> 05:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
preferred to have seen interim studying
 
05:36:53.948 --> 05:36:53.958 align:start position:0%
if anything to you know as uh to amplify
 
05:36:56.470 --> 05:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
ruia's comments so that a further cons
 
05:36:58.670 --> 05:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
discussion may be had as to what would
 
05:37:01.110 --> 05:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
be the appropriate project to be placing
 
05:37:03.230 --> 05:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
into the 10-year plan so with that being
 
05:37:06.430 --> 05:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
said uh I will be voting in the negative
 
05:37:06.440 --> 05:37:07.390 align:start position:0%
said uh I will be voting in the negative
thank

05:37:07.390 --> 05:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:37:10.390 --> 05:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
05:37:13.948 --> 05:37:13.958 align:start position:0%
p i uh I'm in favor of itl and I think
 
05:37:16.270 --> 05:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
that the reason is that we rely on the
 
05:37:19.270 --> 05:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
10-year plan process the project in the
 
05:37:21.628 --> 05:37:21.638 align:start position:0%
10-year plan doesn't specify exactly
 
05:37:24.230 --> 05:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
what the design is it's a project that's
 
05:37:26.628 --> 05:37:26.638 align:start position:0%
funded it's gone through the
 
05:37:29.070 --> 05:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
process you know we can't get involved
 
05:37:30.150 --> 05:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
with the uh
 
05:37:32.230 --> 05:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
integr design decisions of every project
 
05:37:34.628 --> 05:37:34.638 align:start position:0%
in the state nor should we in my opinion
 
05:37:36.830 --> 05:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm in favor of
 
05:37:40.670 --> 05:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
it thank you please representative well
 
05:37:43.070 --> 05:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
well I I agreed that we should it on
 
05:37:44.670 --> 05:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
this bill because you look where they
 
05:37:46.390 --> 05:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
are in the process and the timing of
 
05:37:50.270 --> 05:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
this it I think um given the history of
 
05:37:52.868 --> 05:37:52.878 align:start position:0%
the the recent uh automobile accidents
 
05:37:55.270 --> 05:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
that have taken place I think this isn't
 
05:37:57.350 --> 05:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
going to speed up the process of
 
05:37:59.708 --> 05:37:59.718 align:start position:0%
resolving preventing another death I
 
05:38:02.310 --> 05:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
mean I think the 10-year plan contains
 
05:38:03.990 --> 05:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
is moving along and probably will
 
05:38:06.510 --> 05:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
resolve come up with a resolution in
 
05:38:08.190 --> 05:38:08.200 align:start position:0%
just about the same time so I don't
 
05:38:10.628 --> 05:38:10.638 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary to try to rush this
 
05:38:13.670 --> 05:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
project I nor do I think it will thank
 
05:38:15.868 --> 05:38:15.878 align:start position:0%
you representative any further
 
05:38:17.708 --> 05:38:17.718 align:start position:0%

commission charge the same as the charge
 
05:43:18.030 --> 05:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
in this bill so that the commission can

study both the road toll and the
 
05:43:23.110 --> 05:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
registration fee and that makes this
 
05:43:25.030 --> 05:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
redundant and not as good because it's
 
05:43:27.030 --> 05:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
not as long lasting and it doesn't have
 
05:43:28.030 --> 05:43:28.040 align:start position:0%

other Bill the amendment modifies the
 
05:51:28.628 --> 05:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
charge of the commission to be equal to
 
05:51:31.350 --> 05:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
the charge of the study committee that
 
05:51:34.468 --> 05:51:34.478 align:start position:0%
we just ited so that the commission can
 
05:51:36.190 --> 05:51:36.200 align:start position:0%
study both the rotol and the
 
05:51:38.708 --> 05:51:38.718 align:start position:0%
registration fee that's the only effect
 
05:51:41.030 --> 05:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:43.590 --> 05:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
amendment is there a
 
05:51:47.430 --> 05:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
discussion yes please represent yeah I I
 
05:51:51.750 --> 05:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
just got a question um on this
 
05:51:57.270 --> 05:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
um line 24 to 26 says all Motor
 
05:51:59.628 --> 05:51:59.638 align:start position:0%
Vehicles contribute proportionately
 
05:52:02.190 --> 05:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
including Vehicles registered out of
 
05:52:04.990 --> 05:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
state that may no longer be subject to
 
05:52:07.590 --> 05:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
the road toll what what does that refer
 
05:52:07.600 --> 05:52:08.830 align:start position:0%
the road toll what what does that refer
to

05:52:08.830 --> 05:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:52:11.708 --> 05:52:11.718 align:start position:0%
anyway Jack well I would refer that
 
05:52:17.510 --> 05:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:22.430 --> 05:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:26.110 --> 05:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
we the excuse me representative Jack are
 
05:52:30.590 --> 05:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
you referring to the previous uh or to
 
05:52:35.390 --> 05:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:38.190 --> 05:52:38.200 align:start position:0%
commission that that would be
 
05:52:42.628 --> 05:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:44.468 --> 05:52:44.478 align:start position:0%
representative I think I remember the
 
05:52:47.150 --> 05:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
answer that we to discuss beforehand
 
05:52:49.230 --> 05:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
that thank you please if we
 
05:52:53.110 --> 05:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
don't have the uh road to gas
 
05:52:56.070 --> 05:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
tax and collect through registration
 
05:52:58.910 --> 05:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
fees then there's a missing element
 
05:53:00.468 --> 05:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
people from other states who drive on
 
05:53:03.070 --> 05:53:03.080 align:start position:0%
our roads aren't paying so they want to
 
05:53:05.788 --> 05:53:05.798 align:start position:0%
look at ways that that we might recover
 
05:53:05.798 --> 05:53:06.510 align:start position:0%
look at ways that that we might recover
from

05:53:06.510 --> 05:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:53:10.868 --> 05:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
that that loss if we don't have
 
05:53:14.548 --> 05:53:14.558 align:start position:0%
the kazinski does that satisfy
 
05:53:17.190 --> 05:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
your would that be like say electric
 
05:53:19.150 --> 05:53:19.160 align:start position:0%
vehicles or something is that what
 
05:53:22.190 --> 05:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
that's referring to be know some other
 
05:53:24.350 --> 05:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
states driving through the
 
05:53:28.310 --> 05:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
state or in the state wouldn't be paying
 
05:53:30.750 --> 05:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
registration fees
 
05:53:34.030 --> 05:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
so uh is there a way to have them pay a
 
05:53:34.040 --> 05:53:35.110 align:start position:0%
so uh is there a way to have them pay a
fair

05:53:35.110 --> 05:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
fair
 
05:53:38.190 --> 05:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
share uh it could be any type of
 
05:53:41.310 --> 05:53:41.320 align:start position:0%
vehicle um again they're looking at
 
05:53:44.468 --> 05:53:44.478 align:start position:0%
alternatives to the gas tax so maybe
 
05:53:47.150 --> 05:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
replacing it or replacing it in part or
 
05:53:48.468 --> 05:53:48.478 align:start position:0%
recognizing the fact that we're not
 
05:53:51.430 --> 05:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
collecting as much from from the gas tax
 
05:53:51.440 --> 05:53:52.548 align:start position:0%
collecting as much from from the gas tax
because

05:53:52.548 --> 05:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:53:55.110 --> 05:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
of increased
 
05:53:59.390 --> 05:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
U vehicle you know efficiency so if if
 
05:54:02.190 --> 05:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
the road toll the commission has already
 
05:54:04.070 --> 05:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
been looking at other states that are
 
05:54:08.548 --> 05:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
doing a charge by the mile and they um
 
05:54:10.390 --> 05:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
because the problem problem always comes
 
05:54:12.190 --> 05:54:12.200 align:start position:0%
up with where so many people are coming
 
05:54:16.548 --> 05:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
through here um we're losing Revenue but
 
05:54:19.150 --> 05:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
how do we capture if we're not if we
 
05:54:21.510 --> 05:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the registration fee how
 
05:54:23.230 --> 05:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to capture that and that's
 
05:54:24.868 --> 05:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
part of the whole issue with the
 
05:54:27.310 --> 05:54:27.320 align:start position:0%
commission is there a model out there
 
05:54:28.910 --> 05:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
that'll make up that difference and one
 
05:54:32.670 --> 05:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
of those models is a miles
 
05:54:35.350 --> 05:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
traveled uh there's some technology
 
05:54:37.270 --> 05:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
heading that way some of the states are
 
05:54:40.190 --> 05:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
doing self-reporting some of the states
 
05:54:44.070 --> 05:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
are um are collecting that from uh every
 
05:54:46.310 --> 05:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
time you register your vehicle but then
 
05:54:49.270 --> 05:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
how does our state get that portion it's
 
05:54:50.868 --> 05:54:50.878 align:start position:0%
a huge dilemma and that's what we're
 
05:54:54.150 --> 05:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
looking at okay I don't think clouds it
 
05:54:55.830 --> 05:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
represent Jack do you see I don't see
 
05:55:00.270 --> 05:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:03.548 --> 05:55:03.558 align:start position:0%
okay further questions yes yeah and this
 
05:55:05.910 --> 05:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
this the bill where this will only make
 
05:55:09.110 --> 05:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
it go till the end of this year no this
 
05:55:12.350 --> 05:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
commission extends out to 2026 okay did
 
05:55:14.030 --> 05:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
that have to say that in this amendment
 
05:55:17.230 --> 05:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
anywhere because it doesn't I I believe
 
05:55:19.628 --> 05:55:19.638 align:start position:0%
it's Incorporated this would incorporate
 
05:55:22.548 --> 05:55:22.558 align:start position:0%
into the bill for the commission and the
 
05:55:25.788 --> 05:55:25.798 align:start position:0%
commission speaks of going to
 
05:55:29.430 --> 05:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
2026 and then once if if we get um if I
 
05:55:32.430 --> 05:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
give you some background so so this this
 
05:55:34.030 --> 05:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
again is going to take the governor
 
05:55:35.948 --> 05:55:35.958 align:start position:0%
months before it makes it to the bill if
 
05:55:37.948 --> 05:55:37.958 align:start position:0%
we make it through the process again it
 
05:55:40.868 --> 05:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
usually has steam to do that we have
 
05:55:43.788 --> 05:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
talked about forming a subcommittee in
 
05:55:45.830 --> 05:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
public works once we know people are
 
05:55:48.270 --> 05:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
interested in this moving forward that
 
05:55:50.868 --> 05:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
we would then invite
 
05:55:54.190 --> 05:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
do um Environmental Services all the
 
05:55:56.670 --> 05:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
players to come in and we'll work on it
 
05:55:59.230 --> 05:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
during that inum period so by the time
 
05:56:02.468 --> 05:56:02.478 align:start position:0%
we pick this back up in September that
 
05:56:04.430 --> 05:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
you know we haven't lost the
 
05:56:10.070 --> 05:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:14.948 --> 05:56:14.958 align:start position:0%
intent okay so um motion is to accept
 
05:56:17.990 --> 05:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh as stated if you are is
 
05:56:19.590 --> 05:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion before we
 
05:56:23.110 --> 05:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
call a hand vote yes please I'm I'm just
 
05:56:25.310 --> 05:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
going to uh throw this out here in South
 
05:56:28.548 --> 05:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
NASA there are gas stations gas pumps
 
05:56:32.070 --> 05:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
at BJ's and at Sam's and there are a lot
 
05:56:35.190 --> 05:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
of outof State people that come up and I
 
05:56:38.190 --> 05:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
just want to comment that I can remember
 
05:56:40.868 --> 05:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
sometime in the last few
 
05:56:40.878 --> 05:56:43.070 align:start position:0%
sometime in the last few
years

05:56:43.070 --> 05:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
years
 
05:56:45.590 --> 05:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
do I'm pretty sure I heard it from
 
05:56:48.468 --> 05:56:48.478 align:start position:0%
through do they keep track of because
 
05:56:50.270 --> 05:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
you enter if if you're charging it
 
05:56:52.430 --> 05:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
you're putting in your zip code and they
 
05:56:55.110 --> 05:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
can keep track of out of state things
 
05:56:58.230 --> 05:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
would would Vehicles typically coming up
 
05:57:00.310 --> 05:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts buying gas up here
 
05:57:02.230 --> 05:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
but then racing back to Massachusetts
 
05:57:05.110 --> 05:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
would they get caught up in this also or
 
05:57:07.230 --> 05:57:07.240 align:start position:0%
the commission could look at that so
 
05:57:09.030 --> 05:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
commiss to look the commissions to look
 
05:57:11.750 --> 05:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
at that as far as the gas concerned if
 
05:57:13.510 --> 05:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
they if they come into our state and buy
 
05:57:15.390 --> 05:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
gas we're getting we're getting the
 
05:57:17.590 --> 05:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
revenue from that getting the revenue
 
05:57:19.868 --> 05:57:19.878 align:start position:0%
there there's a whole there's a whole
 
05:57:23.030 --> 05:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
issue with how for us to get paid for
 
05:57:26.708 --> 05:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
people that charge in our state and that
 
05:57:28.868 --> 05:57:28.878 align:start position:0%
that has just not been worked out yet
 
05:57:31.190 --> 05:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
because our state is is a different
 
05:57:34.670 --> 05:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
system of electric utilities and some
 
05:57:36.510 --> 05:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
states they've worked it out and we're
 
05:57:38.270 --> 05:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
hoping that part of the charge of the
 
05:57:41.110 --> 05:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
commission is to find a way for us to
 
05:57:44.230 --> 05:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
capture some of that money and then you
 
05:57:46.430 --> 05:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
know so that's that's where we're at
 
05:57:48.110 --> 05:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
it's complicated there are a lot of
 
05:57:50.350 --> 05:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
great Partners we've kept the same
 
05:57:53.030 --> 05:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
people together uh will involve the
 
05:57:54.948 --> 05:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
committee once this passes through the
 
05:57:56.990 --> 05:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
house and the senate or at least through
 
05:57:58.830 --> 05:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
the house will start meeting and then I
 
05:58:01.708 --> 05:58:01.718 align:start position:0%
would invite committee members then to
 
05:58:05.468 --> 05:58:05.478 align:start position:0%
join us as non- voting members but um it
 
05:58:07.548 --> 05:58:07.558 align:start position:0%

05:58:11.590 --> 05:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
that Public Works has major seats at

05:58:22.070 --> 05:58:22.080 align:start position:0%

05:58:25.628 --> 05:58:25.638 align:start position:0%

commission I've been working at the
 
05:59:33.628 --> 05:59:33.638 align:start position:0%
pleasure of working with you and other
 
05:59:35.070 --> 05:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
members of the commission I think we
 
05:59:36.990 --> 05:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
need to keep it up and hopefully we can
 
05:59:38.708 --> 05:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
get some work done in the next few
 
05:59:40.990 --> 05:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
months thank
 
05:59:43.910 --> 05:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
you any further comment yes represent
 
05:59:46.190 --> 05:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
just just the same basically the same
 
05:59:48.150 --> 05:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
comment this this commission is actually
 
05:59:52.070 --> 05:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
probably been going on for 10 years 12
 
05:59:53.350 --> 05:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
years but
 
05:59:55.468 --> 05:59:55.478 align:start position:0%
unfortunately every two years there's
 
05:59:57.230 --> 05:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
new players there's new people elected
 
06:00:00.230 --> 06:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
and it had to start all over again and
 
06:00:02.110 --> 06:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
this time we recognized we had some
 
06:00:05.110 --> 06:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
return members so this is our attempt to
 
06:00:07.310 --> 06:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
get this to become a permanent
 
06:00:11.948 --> 06:00:11.958 align:start position:0%
commission that reports to this Public
 
06:00:16.070 --> 06:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
Works committee and it just can go on as
 
06:00:19.548 --> 06:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
long as it takes to get to a solution to
 
06:00:22.590 --> 06:00:22.600 align:start position:0%

sessions um with different department
 
06:03:08.830 --> 06:03:08.840 align:start position:0%
heads of do providing a background of of
 
06:03:11.990 --> 06:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
their expertise my thought is we're
 
06:03:13.548 --> 06:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
going to be here
 
06:03:16.990 --> 06:03:17.000 align:start position:0%

going to have session afterwards so we
 
06:03:25.750 --> 06:03:25.760 align:start position:0%

we'll we'll take a long day on Wednesday
 
06:03:30.590 --> 06:03:30.600 align:start position:0%

06:05:16.390 --> 06:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
believe we haven't done the public input
 
06:05:17.948 --> 06:05:17.958 align:start position:0%
until we've been through the
 
06:05:21.150 --> 06:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
presentations Ty yeah I think vaguely Mr
 
06:05:23.708 --> 06:05:23.718 align:start position:0%
chair that we haven't done usually we've
 
06:05:25.830 --> 06:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
done a presentation then we may do a
 
06:05:28.350 --> 06:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
public hearing on the um on another day
 
06:05:31.030 --> 06:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
from but it can vary from year chair to
 
06:05:33.070 --> 06:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
chair but this is what we we've done it
 
06:05:36.948 --> 06:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
I think last term we did presentations
 
06:05:39.150 --> 06:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
and then a public hearing as I vaguely
 
06:05:42.070 --> 06:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
remember for a public notice it would
 
06:05:44.590 --> 06:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
appear that your records have been water
 
06:05:48.030 --> 06:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
damaged and no longer to be found okay
 
06:05:51.150 --> 06:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
so we're going to exclude yours okay um
 
06:05:52.990 --> 06:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
Chrissy you would you would spend some
 
06:05:54.628 --> 06:05:54.638 align:start position:0%
time on that do you want to comment on
 
06:06:08.190 --> 06:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:10.670 --> 06:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
yeah 20 because 2020 was Co we didn't
 
06:06:12.510 --> 06:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
have a
 
06:06:21.948 --> 06:06:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:25.468 --> 06:06:25.478 align:start position:0%
I well I I I think we've done that
 
06:06:28.350 --> 06:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
before I I remember Vegas once we had
 
06:06:31.670 --> 06:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
the uh the presentation because it was
 
06:06:33.990 --> 06:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
one of those years where there there
 
06:06:35.590 --> 06:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't any
 
06:06:38.830 --> 06:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
argumentative positions to be had so the
 
06:06:40.510 --> 06:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
and we held the public hearing
 
06:06:42.390 --> 06:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
afterwards like we took the presentation
 
06:06:44.708 --> 06:06:44.718 align:start position:0%
didn't take all day yeah we had rather
 
06:06:47.310 --> 06:06:47.320 align:start position:0%
than do it over two days we had the
 
06:06:49.430 --> 06:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
presentation in the morning let's just
 
06:06:51.708 --> 06:06:51.718 align:start position:0%
say and then the public Hearing in the
 
06:06:53.350 --> 06:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon and if we had nobody at the
 
06:06:55.390 --> 06:06:55.400 align:start position:0%

06:07:08.390 --> 06:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
