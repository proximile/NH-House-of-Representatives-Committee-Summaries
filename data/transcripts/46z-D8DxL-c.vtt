00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 align:start position:0%
seeing yes he just to the restroom we're
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
just thank you and welcome everybody to
 
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
the work session on House Bill 608 I
 
00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
will call it to this meeting to order um
 
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 608 was introduced by
 
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards um looking
 
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
at the potential challenges um and
 
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
potential shocks to the system of in the
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
um developmental disabilities Community
 
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
as it moved to a conflict free case
 
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 align:start position:0%
management and several other changes
 
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
that needed to be done in order to come
 
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
into compliance with uh CMS requirements
 
00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 align:start position:0%
um it it was a process where we had this
 
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
bill in order to include a pilot program
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
um and there have been some requests to
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
go through a waiver process um however
 
00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 align:start position:0%
we moved ahead with a July 1st
 
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
implementation date and we have some
 
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
people here in the audience who have had
 
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
firsthand experiences with what has
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
happened since July 1st and the process
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
before and um given that we missed the
 
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
window with this bill specifically for
 
00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
this Pro problem but there are multiple
 
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
other changes to the system coming um I
 
00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 align:start position:0%
think it would be good to see sort of
 
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
what happened get a bit of an after
 
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
action and see if the pilot project idea
 
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
may be something that helps us going
 
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
forward to um avoid some more
 
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
disruptions um so uh with that um let's
 
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
say actually Jess would you like to
 
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards would you like to
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
you I don't know that we're all at form
 
00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 align:start position:0%
but I'm representative Jess Edwards I
 
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
think I know you all um it's been about
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
9 months since I introduced 608 the
 
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
concept of 608 is represent on just said
 
00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
was to um encourage or actually mandate
 
00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 align:start position:0%
that the uh Department execute a pilot
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
project because we knew there was a
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
radical change to the building system
 
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 align:start position:0%
and that was causing a great deal of uh
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
concern and for whatever reason um
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
because I wasn't part of the minutia of
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
of what happened from the
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
introduction um neither did the bill get
 
00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
passed nor did the department choose to
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
implement a pilot project they did not
 
00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
require a law to do a pilot project
 
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
that's just good basic management it's
 
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
almost it's not 101 level management but
 
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
it's certainly you know 301 or 401 it's
 
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
not graduate level stuff if you're going
 
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
to do something very complex it affects
 
00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
a great number of stakeholders and a
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
very dramatic and systemic way uh you
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
want to do a pilot project roll it out
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
in a graceful way the department didn't
 
00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
do that and it was chaos they created
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
chaos they created unnecessary burdens
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
on the care providers to to deal in a
 
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 align:start position:0%
transition period where they were doing
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
without their regular uh battle rhythm
 
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
of reimbursements for the work that they
 
00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
were doing and that created um great
 
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 align:start position:0%
deal of anxiety and financial stress to
 
00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:34.919 align:start position:0%
where some unusual measures had to be
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
implemented to um essentially prepay
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
some money so that so some of the strong
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
area agencies could float some of the
 
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
less capable area agencies and so so we
 
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
ended up with this huge system of
 
00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
workarounds that are also now causing
 
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
secondary and tertiary problems as the
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
department tries to roll it back so my
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
bottom line is I just want to leave you
 
00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:03.639 align:start position:0%
with the idea that it 608 was a good
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
bill uh real life real history is
 
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that the department blew it
 
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
and the the department needs to um
 
00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:15.039 align:start position:0%
consider in the future doing pilot
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
projects for similar roll outs of major
 
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.149 align:start position:0%
projects for similar roll outs of major
systems

00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
changes um so so 608 is moot for the
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
issue in which it was intended but to
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
the chair's point of view there are two
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
other opportunities where the bill could
 
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
be repurposed to address other major
 
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
rollouts uh one of them uh and and um
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
there's people here in the crowd that
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
would be better to go into the detail
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
but to just give you the two highlights
 
00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
one is um the um electronic verification
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
system that Services uh ordered and
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
performed and has been taken care of
 
00:08:58.269 --> 00:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
properly and that's going to trigger all
 
00:08:59.710 --> 00:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
of the billing
 
00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
that's the one I think probably needs to
 
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
to be piloted still and then um and I
 
00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:07.959 align:start position:0%
forget the second one already because I
 
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
got obsessed with the with the first one
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
so um so I hope that I mean you you can
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead and recommend killing this bill
 
00:09:21.069 --> 00:09:21.079 align:start position:0%
you know because uh you know it's
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
overcome by
 
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
events but because of the lethargy in
 
00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
the department and their failure to do
 
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
the right thing with p
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
projects I don't know that I would
 
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
recommend doing away with 608 I think I
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
would recommend that you consider
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
repurposing 608 for another high
 
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
priority roll out to force the hand of a
 
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
department that seemed unwilling to do
 
00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:49.959 align:start position:0%
basic Common Sense management and I'm
 
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I was so harsh uh but this is why
 
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
I think they sent the lawyer instead of
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
the The
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
Operators so so that's it if you have
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
any questions I'd be happy to address
 
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
them but there are other people here
 
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.750 align:start position:0%
them but there are other people here
representative

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
Leber I just have a point of order um I
 
00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:10.590 align:start position:0%
Leber I just have a point of order um I
I

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
wonder I me I would take the position
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
that if the decision is to pursue
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
repurposing this to deal with completely
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
different programs that that would
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
require a minimum notice that we have
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
changed the purpose of the bill so that
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
people affected who might not have
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
decided to come to this hearing because
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
they didn't think it was going to affect
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
them would have notice um my my my
 
00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:42.519 align:start position:0%
preference would be to itl the bill and
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
then take up representative Edwards very
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
Salient points going forward thank you
 
00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:50.470 align:start position:0%
Salient points going forward thank you
representative

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you um following up on
 
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
represent who's sorry see you moment
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
I concur I think one of the things we
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
could do if we do decide to repurpose
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
something versus iing it that would
 
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
probably trigger a non- gerain Amendment
 
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
yeah that's to to your point right so
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
therefore if we do create a non-main
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
amendment that would actually create
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
another hearing which should continue to
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
go forward with it without having to
 
00:11:20.629 --> 00:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
reinduce an LSR is that right okay thank
 
00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
you that's so if I may comment on those
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
two things because they're really close
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
to each other I I think the way I wrote
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
608 it's uh flexible and non-specific
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
enough to where picking up one of the
 
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.350 align:start position:0%
enough to where picking up one of the
other

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
BDS projects wouldn't necessarily be
 
00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:43.079 align:start position:0%
nin's remain but because I listened to
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative Weber on on everything
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
she says about procedure and policy I I
 
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
think she's absolutely right that uh it
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
would it would take some more effort if
 
00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
you wanted to repurpose the bill we I've
 
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
missed the window for introducing ing
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
new legislation in January so so so I
 
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
sort of look at this 608 as maybe
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
something that's not dead that that we
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
could recast and continue to work on but
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
I I'll I'll defer to the experts on the
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
on the committee um representative
 
00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:19.839 align:start position:0%
Edwards um I know that there are the two
 
00:12:22.189 --> 00:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
upcoming changes the rate work and that
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
electronic billing issue um but I is
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
there an expectation that there's other
 
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
changes in the future because
 
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
um my choice would be that there's going
 
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.470 align:start position:0%
um my choice would be that there's going
to

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
be that we've already seen that this one
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
was fumbled um throughout the process
 
00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps um requiring that good business
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
project process of having a pilot
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
program Whenever there might be a
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
significant change to the system might
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
be the best Ultimate uh way to proceed
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
so that it's not just these programs but
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
um anything that's a major significant
 
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
change so so would you like feedback on
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
that yes please I I I would be reluctant
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
as a kind of a small government leaning
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
guy to legislate that the state shall
 
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
use good business
 
00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
practices this is an example of a good
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
business practice that anyone who's gone
 
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
and got an education and management
 
00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:21.079 align:start position:0%
would know about so so if if you were to
 
00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
legislate that they do pilot projects
 
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:25.720 align:start position:0%
for well-defined kinds of
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
scenarios then that would just sort of
 
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
open the question to what other Common
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
Sense business practice might we want to
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
legislate should should we legislate
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
that they learn that you know you debit
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
on the left credit on the right they I
 
00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
mean it's just I I I don't know how to U
 
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
Define it in a way in which we're not
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
setting up a precedent for over
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
management from A legislature but that's
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
my thought I thank you um representative
 
00:13:58.829 --> 00:13:58.839 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you um I'm I'm a little I
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
want to understand a lot better what
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
what went on with what's happening right
 
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
now because A&amp;M made five major
 
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
recommendations for a new
 
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
system um you know billing was just a
 
00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:11.959 align:start position:0%
small part of it you know you know
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
looking at tiered waiver systems
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates and I they one of
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
the biggest recommendations they made
 
00:14:21.069 --> 00:14:21.079 align:start position:0%
was a new it system that was really
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
expensive um how to deal with weight
 
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
lists and so on and so forth I mean what
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
what part of those five elements was
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
actually dealt with and and what was
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
done thank you for the question I in
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
effect none of them got dealt with one
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
of them has already kind of come and
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
gone its window of opportunity and that
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
was the pilot project of the direct
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
billing methodology what that meant is
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
that CMS changed their rules a few years
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
ago in the state bought some time
 
00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:55.639 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road a little
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
bit until they their backs got up
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
against the wall on this one July
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
deadline uh and what needed to happen
 
00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
was instead of having uh the department
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
reimbursing the area agencies and the
 
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
area agencies taking care of the
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
payments to the service providers they
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
were trying to get the middlemen out CMS
 
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
was trying to get the middlemen out and
 
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
and creating service providers doing
 
00:15:23.949 --> 00:15:23.959 align:start position:0%
direct billing so as you know as a a
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
practitioner a private practitioner if
 
00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:28.279 align:start position:0%
you if you're if in your Billing System
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
gets screwed up and you don't get
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursements for 3 months longer than
 
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:35.319 align:start position:0%
you expected or longer that's that
 
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
causes you a real problem you can't pay
 
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.430 align:start position:0%
causes you a real problem you can't pay
your

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
administrative administrator your
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
medical records people it's it's it's
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
the same sort of implication for the
 
00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
service providers through the um in in
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
in the DD community so there's still
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
like you said there are four other
 
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
possibilities two of them seem to be
 
00:15:59.550 --> 00:15:59.560 align:start position:0%
more ripe for pilot project
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
yes just a quick followup so in other
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
words we can still use this bill for
 
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:05.720 align:start position:0%
those four elements to create a pilot
 
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
project to look at the whole program I I
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
would defer to whatever representative
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
Weber says uh I I think you can but I'm
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
reckless so um I I I would I would defer
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
to her if I may yes there's nothing that
 
00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:24.759 align:start position:0%
prohibit prohibits that that I know
 
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
of what is required though and I would
 
00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
obviously defer to the house clerk on
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
this but what is required is when you
 
00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
exceed the scope of the original Bill
 
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
such that people who might be affected
 
00:16:43.389 --> 00:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
by it and need to have notice of what's
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
going to happen so they can come and
 
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
talk to us about it so what we would
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
actually be doing is restarting the
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
hearing process now and finishing it by
 
00:16:58.509 --> 00:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
November 17th which is not impossible
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
possible but
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
it's a stretch and it would require a
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
great deal of commitment and I certainly
 
00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:09.079 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sure we're going to hear from the
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
Department as well and and perhaps
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
anybody else who is affected on this
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
before making that determination that
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to put that effort
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
in um and then to CL sorry oh perfect
 
00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.390 align:start position:0%
in um and then to CL sorry oh perfect
represent

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
Merchant I'm going to rely upon
 
00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
represent Weber our knowledge parli
 
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.390 align:start position:0%
represent Weber our knowledge parli
attorney

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:35.799 align:start position:0%
wise if we do introduce an amendment
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
that's not in
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
gerain do that mean that we still have
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
to do something by November 17th we do
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you on Deadline yes um
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
and then I have a question for you
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards um is the um rate
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
work and the electronic billing system
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
both included within the Alvarez and uh
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
Marshall public sector Services
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.110 align:start position:0%
Marshall public sector Services
recommendations

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing a whisper in the back that
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
yes and I I actually would have said yes
 
00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.110 align:start position:0%
yes and I I actually would have said yes
too

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
so so then I think that well we would
 
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
need to see that if we do look to the
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
rest of the A&amp;M processes obviously the
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
deadline of starting it no later than
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
July 1st would be a problem um but there
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
but more of it may still stay applicable
 
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
since those are within their
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant again I'm going
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
to rely upon repesent
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
Weber my understanding if we want to
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
introduce an
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
LSR after the deadline that could be
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
approved by the rules committee so
 
00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:39.919 align:start position:0%
therefore we could make it motion to the
 
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
rules committee to introduce another LSR
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
late in this time to help address some
 
00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.039 align:start position:0%
of the issue versus going through a n
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
correct that that would also be a
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
possibility um you would have to um
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
arrange with the speaker
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
for um for a meeting of the rules
 
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
committee and I think there are other
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
ways to let me look them up while you
 
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
talk among yourselves so so the need for
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
another for legislation to require a
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
pilot project would be obviously
 
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
obviated if the department just said it
 
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
was going to do
 
00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200 align:start position:0%
one the
 
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:28.600 align:start position:0%
legislation makes them do it when they
 
00:19:31.149 --> 00:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to do it and I would think
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
after the disaster that they just
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
Unleashed upon the beneficiaries the DD
 
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
system uh that they have learned a
 
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:41.720 align:start position:0%
lesson and that they would want to come
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
and work on a pilot project outside of a
 
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.390 align:start position:0%
and work on a pilot project outside of a
legal

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:19:49.549 --> 00:19:49.559 align:start position:0%
requirement thank you merch
 
00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
requirement thank you merch

Merchant in regards
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
to the oversight committee for DHHS does
 
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
that that committee have a role here
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
where it could hold the department more
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
accountable to what's happening versus
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
trying to do it strictly through
 
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
legislation which is going to be
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
difficult at this point in
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
time look I've been on the oversight
 
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
committee I think a couple of terms I
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
think representative Weber's been on
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
there too and I've I've gotten lazy I
 
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
just defer to her whenever a question
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
like that comes up but I I I I I I don't
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
think the oversight committee has within
 
00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
its uh statutory Authority the ability
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
to hold somebody accountable or to hold
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
a department accountable what what what
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
we can do is is we can you know make a
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
motion and vote on it in the in the in
 
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee and um and maybe
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
publicize it I I we've never done that
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
in the two years I've been there though
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
so it would be uh an experience that
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
I've not had
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
yet and if I may my experience of the
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
oversight committee is it's not uh a
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
body that
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
can uh direct anybody to do anything in
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
the same way that we would have I mean a
 
00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:11.799 align:start position:0%
bill has to be done with Bill
 
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
formalities uh it's certainly a place
 
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
for discussion and um concern and often
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
resolution as as representative Edwards
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
says it's perfectly possible right now
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
for the Department to do a pilot program
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
uh so they don't need our bless for that
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
but uh the if if the desire is to compel
 
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
a particular action that can't happen
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
and I I will also say that the the um
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
oversight committee is pretty chocka
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
block with a lot of different things it
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
could have a subcommittee to work on
 
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
this but again the process there is
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
going to be very spread out and I'm
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not seeing the piece
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the rules that speaks to late
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
drafting so I'm I'm not going to address
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
point Thank um representative Nel thank
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome um I I'm still I I
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
assume we're going to hear the other
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
side of this today I I don't know if the
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
Department's prepared to defend
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
themselves against my beating them up in
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
public like this uh but they should just
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
accept that what I said is accurate what
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
I'm getting at is I I I'm struggling
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
with why we need to it this thing at all
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
I mean it seems to me that when I look
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
at what was supposed to be covered in
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
this pilot program much of it's still in
 
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
existence and still can go forward the
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
way it is there's only one thing here
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
that it seems that has been addressed
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
that's the billing there's four other
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
things here that haven't been addressed
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's why I didn't like the word non
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
German because I just don't sorry yeah
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um I I I think that
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps now I think we've had some good
 
00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:01.919 align:start position:0%
discussion about what we what path we
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
may be able to take I'd like to hear
 
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
some more about the actual
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
implementation of this and um how big of
 
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
an impact it's had on some of the area
 
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
agencies impation of the billing yes the
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
implementation of the billing
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.630 align:start position:0%

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
and after you come up if I could have
 
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.310 align:start position:0%

about what our direct experience has
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
been we do not represent um any other
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
area agencies I can talk to the
 
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
specifics of the conversations I've had
 
00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
with providers but I believe um we have
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
some documentation that we'd like to
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
share with you that shows our
 
00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
financials um and what's happened the

last 3 months um since the
 
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
implementation and then also talk about
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
some of the fixes that um need to occur
 
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
in an impact statement we're going to
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
try to keep it very brief and very high
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
level um but if you have questions feel
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%

sure is it okay if I bring up uh yes
 
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
please that help if we can read along
 
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
thank you the first uh handout that
 
00:24:59.070 --> 00:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking at is a high level
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
summary of our finances um actual
 
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
activity at one sky for the first
 
00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:05.559 align:start position:0%
quarter of FY
 
00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:18.149 align:start position:0%
quarter of FY
24

00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
sure so this will be the first one that
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
at okay
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to just briefly speak about
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
what led um to our current
 
00:25:38.909 --> 00:25:38.919 align:start position:0%
situation um over the past fiscal year
 
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
so January of 2022 through June of
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
2023 um we had been implementing some
 
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
changes to our system um in which case
 
00:25:56.909 --> 00:25:56.919 align:start position:0%
you know we supplied all um all
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
available data and an accurate and
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
compliant format um and during this
 
00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:06.350 align:start position:0%
compliant format um and during this
transition

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
transition
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
um the the changes somehow got into the
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
new system incorrectly which has caused
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
a significant um a significant problem
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
with our ability to bill um and receive
 
00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh appropriate funding for our service
 
00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:28.470 align:start position:0%
uh appropriate funding for our service
author

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
author
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
izations um we also had a um a blackout
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
period during this transition from um
 
00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:42.039 align:start position:0%
the third week in June through the third
 
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
week in
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
July um which again caused significant
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh cash flow um and financial impli
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
implications for um not only us but the
 
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
system as a whole um two questions you
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
provided that information to the
 
00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:02.799 align:start position:0%
department um all of that data the
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
systems data that you provided yes yes
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
sorry and the blackout period what was
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
the impact of a can you explain to us
 
00:27:11.549 --> 00:27:11.559 align:start position:0%
what a blackout period means so the the
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
blackout period would be um a stop of
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
any and all billing of services um
 
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
during that period of time um Services
 
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
may be rendered but they would not be we
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
would not be able to bill for those
 
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
Services until the blackout period ended
 
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
um which dipped into our uh our
 
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.750 align:start position:0%
um which dipped into our uh our
financial

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
financial
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
reserves okay thank
 
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
you uh the first item I'll look at is
 
00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:46.039 align:start position:0%
the um summarized financial statement
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
that has the the colored columns this is
 
00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:51.640 align:start position:0%
a snapshot of our activity for the first
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
quarter of
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
24 uh The Columns that you'll see that
 
00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:58.120 align:start position:0%
says monthly budget The Columns in in
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
purple they are uh an indication of what
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
we as an agency uh had projected that we
 
00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:09.559 align:start position:0%
would earn um and what we would incur as
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
expenses in a given month if the system
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
if all if there were no issues that we
 
00:28:17.149 --> 00:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
had encountered on the other side of
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
July 1st so on a monthly basis we would
 
00:28:23.269 --> 00:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
anticipate earning about $199,000 to the
 
00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:24.269 align:start position:0%
anticipate earning about $199,000 to the
bottom

00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
line however the next column over that
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
you see that's titled fy2 24 activity
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
within each given month is an actual
 
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
representation of what we actually
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
received as Revenue against actual
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
expenses that we incurred for that given
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
month so you'll see in the month of July
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
we actually only earned or received uh
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
just under $11,000 in revenue for that
 
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:52.200 align:start position:0%
month which left us with over a half
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
million dollar loss for the month of
 
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
July what you'll see next to it is a
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
column that's called
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
FY 2023 activity processed in each
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
specific month and what that means is
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's there's activity from FY 23
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
based on the timing that is spilled in
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
fy2 24 so when you see that column while
 
00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:15.080 align:start position:0%
we may have uh re receive some Revenue
 
00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
that's for prior fiscal year activity
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
and it's paying out expenses for the
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
prior fiscal year so it's against
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
obligations we've already incurred and
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
that that has a direct impact because
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
that draws down
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
our uh Financial reserves that we have
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
to draw on because we're not bringing in
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
additional revenue and that carries
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
forward each subsequent month to the
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
point that at this point in the fiscal
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
year at the end of September it was our
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
expectation that we would have incurred
 
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:45.640 align:start position:0%
about a
 
00:29:50.669 --> 00:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
$57,000 positive uh bottom line but
 
00:29:52.509 --> 00:29:52.519 align:start position:0%
year-to dat actually we're about
 
00:29:52.519 --> 00:29:54.389 align:start position:0%
year-to dat actually we're about
$900,000

00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
$900,000
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
um behind about $850,000 ,000 in the red
 
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
based on this inability to properly or
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
adequately build for the services that
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
have been rendered and we've been built
 
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519 align:start position:0%
for and have paid
 
00:30:07.519 --> 00:30:09.190 align:start position:0%
for and have paid
out

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
one one thing I'd like to add is that
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
about uh August 15th we met with the um
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
with BDS and dhj Leadership because
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
there was no uh billing that was
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
occurring for us and we met together as
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
a system and they brought in emergency
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
funding so that emergency funding equals
 
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:36.200 align:start position:0%
$1.6 million and that I would refer to
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
as a bridge loan getting us to the place
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
to where we're able to continue to bill
 
00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
the way BDS and dhss looks at that is
 
00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:48.519 align:start position:0%
that those funds are actually
 
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
prepayments and even though we're not
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
providing them with the detail that 1.6
 
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
million is money that they're paying us
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
for services rendered which which again
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
means that we're still short $900,000 to
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
the state now what is happening now is
 
00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
that CMS can't allow double billing to
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
occur so even though we're billing for
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
services now and we're only being paid
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
45 cents on the
 
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
dollar in order for BDS to come into
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
compliance with CMS Financial rules they
 
00:31:24.269 --> 00:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
have to collect that $1.6 million back
 
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
from us by December 31st
 
00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
so the people who aren't paying us we
 
00:31:32.509 --> 00:31:32.519 align:start position:0%
had to borrow money from them because
 
00:31:34.509 --> 00:31:34.519 align:start position:0%
they weren't paying us and now we have
 
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
to repay them back the money that they
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
didn't pay us to begin with and it's
 
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
essentially going to take any and all of
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
our cash flow plus some by the end of
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
the year now I I do want to recognize
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
that we had a meeting two days ago with
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
BDS and you know there are some very
 
00:31:57.629 --> 00:31:57.639 align:start position:0%
great people working there that are
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
solution focused and they're helping us
 
00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
to get through that um but this is the
 
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:06.440 align:start position:0%
operation and the environment we're
 
00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.029 align:start position:0%
operation and the environment we're
operating

00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
operating
 
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
Nagel thank you and I can appreciate the
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
depths of the
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
problem what I am wondering is we have a
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
bill in front of us and and now that I
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
have refreshed my memory we we only
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
spoke at the last hearing about one
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
phase of the five phases um but the bill
 
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
itself isn't limited to that
 
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to defer to the house clerk
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
about whatever we need to do next uh but
 
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
what I I'd love to hear from you is if
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
we were to take this bill as it is is
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
what which is what I'm hearing saying
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
said from various people and just now
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
start impose a mandate of a pilot
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
project upon the current chaos plus
 
00:33:12.269 --> 00:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
whatever anybody's doing right or wrong
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
to resolve the current chaos are we
 
00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.830 align:start position:0%
to resolve the current chaos are we
helping

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
helping
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
matters a th% yes I I mean I have a
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
couple asks of you and I'm going to get
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
out of okay if if you're getting to that
 
00:33:27.629 --> 00:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if I was Prett no no I I
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
I would like Chris to finish his I'm
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
sorry um but I do have a couple asks of
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
you and I will tell you that everything
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
we're talking about today the evv the
 
00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
rate committee uh work and
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
implementation of the rates is all under
 
00:33:45.389 --> 00:33:45.399 align:start position:0%
that original Marcel and Alvarez uh or
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
Alvarez and Marcel plan so we're we're
 
00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
not talking about different topics we're
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
talking about the same thing this is
 
00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
Phase One of a five act play and
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
we have had control as an area agency
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
system and and again I'm only speaking
 
00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
for one sky but in general we've had
 
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
control of the air agency system for 40
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
years and for 40 years this has worked
 
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
and it's worked well BDS has had control
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
of it for 90 some odd days and some of
 
00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:19.079 align:start position:0%
the impact statements that I've gotten
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
from providers are significant and I
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
know some of them had sent them in so I
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
won't you know read them off um
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
but the system in my humble opinion
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
can't take much more and we have vendors
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
that are into their line of credit they
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
are um only getting paid you know like
 
00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:47.320 align:start position:0%
we are pennies on the dollar um and that
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
and I will say to bds's credit they are
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
cash and fusing but we're still $900,000
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
short and they want their money back and
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
we're only getting 45 cents on the
 
00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
dollar so it it doesn't make a lot of
 
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
sense um and again there there are
 
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
actual people at BDS that have common
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
sense and they make sense but I don't
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
think they're in
 
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
charge um you know and I I'm not going
 
00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
to mention names even though I really
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
want to because I really like them a lot
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
and I think they're smart and I actually
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
think they're solution focused and
 
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
minded um and I'd love to mention their
 
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
names but I won't
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to point anyone out
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
for good or bad I don't want to find
 
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:33.640 align:start position:0%
fault in any one person I don't want to
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
pin this on anyone what what I'm asking
 
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
and I think through Jess's uh
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative Edward's bill
 
00:35:46.589 --> 00:35:46.599 align:start position:0%
is we need to stop we need to fix what
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
we've done at this point and stop
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
everything else it's a reasonable
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
request that doesn't mean that we stop
 
00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.829 align:start position:0%
request that doesn't mean that we stop
it

00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
indefinitely by any stretch of the in
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
ination some of this stuff is actually
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
good ideas but we need to stop we need
 
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
to fix the financial situation of the
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
system as a whole because I have
 
00:36:07.309 --> 00:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
providers that are on their line of
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
credit right now for
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
$750,000 $500,000
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
$250,000 that's just three people three
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
companies off the top of my head um get
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
them right sized get their budgets fixed
 
00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
um BDS has cut uh rman board budgets and
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
just so you understand that's based on
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
actual cost of living
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
so the state is required to provide
 
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
support and that support is housing food
 
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
electricity heat these are essential
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
functions this is what the state needs
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
to pay for uh aside from services to
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
keep people safe in the community and
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
they've cut people's room and board
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
budgets their companies by 130,000 in
 
00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
one case 140,000 is um so that means
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
that that provider has to absorb that
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
cost and to continue providing the
 
00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.230 align:start position:0%
cost and to continue providing the
services

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
now in talking to BDS they've said that
 
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:01.400 align:start position:0%
they just don't have money in that line
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
item so my thought process would be
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
continue to overspend the line item and
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
come to the legislature and say hey we
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
haven't touched this line item in 12
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
years we are now at 4 million 3 million
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
3 and A5 million 4 and a half million
 
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
whatever they're at this is what we need
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
to adequately adequately support people
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
versus causing additional cash flow uh
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
issues for people who aren't even
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
getting paid for the services they're
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
providing and the state has a
 
00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:33.079 align:start position:0%
contractual obligation to pay everyone
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
and they're out of contract and that's a
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
specific performance issue from a legal
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
side um and I think because we are all
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
on the Human Services side we're we're
 
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
not the kind of people that are going to
 
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
twist arms and break them to to get our
 
00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
money um because realistically the money
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
that we get like if you look at our
 
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
whopping profit of $50,000 for 3 months
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
work um um I mean that's just enough to
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
be able to keep our line of credit
 
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
because you have to have debt income
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
ratios at I mean just because we're a
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofit doesn't mean that we're you
 
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
know outside of the realm of what is
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
required to be financially stable so and
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
just so you're all aware we had an
 
00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
individual that was in the hospital for
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
two years that last year we made a
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
conscious decision to buy a house to
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
take that individual out of the hospital
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
and then we retrofitted that house the
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
cost of the home is
 
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
$530,000 we then had to put $600,000
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
into it and that is our money that's not
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
the state's money we didn't get any kind
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
of um anything for that we did that
 
00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
because it was the right thing to do
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
because that
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
individual was so medically needy that
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
even nursing homes wouldn't take the
 
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
person because they recognized them as
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
palet of care but rather than keeping
 
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
them sequestered in a hospital where
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
they're taking up three tertiary care
 
00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
beds for their care
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
um we decided to make that investment
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
and I am very lucky that I have a board
 
00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
that listens to my crazy ideas to do the
 
00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
right thing um and so had I
 
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
known what we were going to be going
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
through this year I would not have
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
bought that house no matter how much I
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to I wouldn't have done it
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking at tying off a
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
tourniquet plan to our business and I've
 
00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
been told we're the money we're going to
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
get the money no matter what and that's
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
great but if you're asking me to repay a
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
loan of $1.6 million so that you can
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
look good for CMS but it's going to
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
crush my company and we sat down last
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
week and we figured out how many people
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
we have to lay off we figured out what
 
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
business lines that cost us money that
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
we don't get money on because we're a
 
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit that we have to cut uh and
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
services that we have to dial back on
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
and again we're we're being told we're
 
00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:52.720 align:start position:0%
going to get the money and by the people
 
00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
who are telling me that I believe them
 
00:39:56.829 --> 00:39:56.839 align:start position:0%
but when we get it is going to make all
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
the difference in the world and if we're
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
being forced to repay $1.6
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
million and we're only getting 45 cents
 
00:40:05.309 --> 00:40:05.319 align:start position:0%
on the dollar and we only have a profit
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
margin of one and a quar per. yes okay
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
one and a quarter percent how do we do
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
that it's the math doesn't make
 
00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:17.870 align:start position:0%
that it's the math doesn't make
sense

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
so so my followup is that still hasn't
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
answered my question because I don't
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
see I see the gravity and enormity of
 
00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.150 align:start position:0%
see I see the gravity and enormity of
the

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
problem and it's a morass what I don't
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
see is how if we simply do something
 
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.069 align:start position:0%
see is how if we simply do something
like

00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
update what we have in front of us with
 
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
new start dates new end dates and say
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
Department you can't do
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
anything because I think it says that in
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
here somewhere and I I will say I have
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
to read it over again a little more
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
carefully because I was remembering it
 
00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
as being smaller than what the language
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
is if we say Department you can't do
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
anything until you've after you've done
 
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
these pilot projects I'm concerned that
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
that language may actually get in the
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
way of some of the workarounds for
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
payment uh I don't know and I also don't
 
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
see how it helps you in your current
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
morass I think it
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
might help with further implementations
 
00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
but I don't see how it addresses what
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
you're describing as a problem and and I
 
00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
will add to that Madam chair that I hope
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
somebody's here from the Department so
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
we can hear from the department at some
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
point but that's that's my question so I
 
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
can tell you that right now so evv is to
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
be implemented U which is the electronic
 
00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
visit verification and just so you all
 
00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
I'm going to give you a 10-second
 
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
overview we have a direct support staff
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
working with an individual let's say
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
they're working with me they will sign
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
on to their phone saying they started
 
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:09.640 align:start position:0%
services with me today take me wherever
 
00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
they take me it tracks their geolocation
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
their start time and their end time and
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
then enters it into our electronic
 
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
systems that's our um HR systems and our
 
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
billing systems and then it
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
automatically builds for us that's
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
supposed to be implemented November 18th
 
00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
I think is the day I might be wrong
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
specifically on the day but mid November
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
um the the because of everything the
 
00:42:36.549 --> 00:42:36.559 align:start position:0%
bureau has now pushed that to March now
 
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
we're still not getting paid if this
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
goes into
 
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
March you know will it be kicked down
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
the road again I don't know in the
 
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
meantime as well we're starting new rate
 
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
work and I sit on the rate work
 
00:42:51.390 --> 00:42:51.400 align:start position:0%
committee so that's figuring out how
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
much we're going to pay um for people
 
00:42:57.069 --> 00:42:57.079 align:start position:0%
like Matt so if I'm like physically
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
aggressive I might be tier whatever and
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
the rate goes off to that so we start
 
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
that work again tomorrow we picked that
 
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
up literally uh tomorrow's Friday right
 
00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
so we we picked that up tomorrow Friday
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
at 10: a.m. and so we're not even fixing
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
or focusing on fixing what's in front of
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
us right now and we're already starting
 
00:43:20.589 --> 00:43:20.599 align:start position:0%
to try to make more changes to
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
everything so how this bill will help is
 
00:43:26.829 --> 00:43:26.839 align:start position:0%
by forcing some common sense
 
00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
um I have sent some emails to some
 
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
people that have said that you are
 
00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
further dist stabilizing what currently
 
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
exists take a breath let's fix what we
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
have right now and I think it might take
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
us 6 months to fix what we have right
 
00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
now to get our providers set um I mean I
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
have I can only speak to our
 
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
organization I have people coming in my
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
office sobbing I have people quitting
 
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
because they mentally can't take the
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
stress anymore because families are
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
calling them now we're losing money hand
 
00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
over fist paying the families and we're
 
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
getting to a point to where we might not
 
00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
be able to do that now when I I say that
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
to the bureau I'm sure they'll Infuse us
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
with cash again
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
but why do we have to get to that point
 
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
and this Common Sense Bill and that's
 
00:44:20.549 --> 00:44:20.559 align:start position:0%
what it is in my opinion it's it it is
 
00:44:20.559 --> 00:44:21.589 align:start position:0%
what it is in my opinion it's it it is
is

00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
fundamentally Common Sense best
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
practices um to just implement the pilot
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
program uh it's a great example we
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
talked about uh rep Nel talked about the
 
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
system for billing right so when they
 
00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
put together New Hampshire easy our
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
interface looks very different or looked
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
they're fixing it right now than what
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
the bureau's interface looked like so if
 
00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
we need to create a plan to work with
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
Brian and for some reason there's an
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
issue with the service
 
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
authorization we go down to question 3
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
six and we say okay it's got to be
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
checked and changed to whatever it needs
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
to be changed to they look on their
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
screen and they're like that's question
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
three for
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
us why do they even have a different
 
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
interface it doesn't make sense and
 
00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
these are all things that if we had done
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
a pilot program and we have done
 
00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.670 align:start position:0%
a pilot program and we have done
responsible

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
implementation we wouldn't have had that
 
00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:20.200 align:start position:0%
issue and again we have people at the
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
bureau who are solution-minded that are
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
helping us work through these issues but
 
00:45:26.829 --> 00:45:26.839 align:start position:0%
we have a whole Confluence of issues
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
that are coming forward now with the
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
rate changes in evv those are the two uh
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
acts two next acts in this play and if
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
we don't stop and pause right now I I
 
00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
mean you have providers that are on
 
00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
their line of credit and you know every
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
dollar that they're borrowing to keep
 
00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
whole and it's affecting massively large
 
00:45:51.589 --> 00:45:51.599 align:start position:0%
companies they have to pay interest on
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
that which means that you know when
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
you're talking about companies that have
 
00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:56.829 align:start position:0%
you're talking about companies that have
2%

00:45:56.829 --> 00:45:56.839 align:start position:0%
2%
 
00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
margins um you know that might be their
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
profit for the year which ends up being
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
like so is a great example we were
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
talking about canceling our an annual um
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
Christmas event that we have and I'll
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
tell you how crazy my event is it cost
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
us $10,000 a year we have a Santa that
 
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:15.880 align:start position:0%
donates their time we have individuals
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
that drive through what takes the three
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
of us and five other people a week to
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
set up with
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
lights I mean and and we're talking
 
00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:25.400 align:start position:0%
about cancelling that and people are
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
calling us I'm saying where is it no I I
 
00:46:30.349 --> 00:46:30.359 align:start position:0%
get that part it's it's it's the what do
 
00:46:32.549 --> 00:46:32.559 align:start position:0%
we do about it part that I think we're
 
00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get to yeah and if I if I may
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes and then I will
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
stop uh what I'm hearing you say is from
 
00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:43.990 align:start position:0%
stop uh what I'm hearing you say is from
your

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
perspective um going forward with this
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
as applied to the other four
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
aspects of the program recommended by
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
A&amp;M would be a good thing
 
00:46:59.470 --> 00:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
is that boiled down to its very essence
 
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
what you're telling us yes I it's very
 
00:47:04.549 --> 00:47:04.559 align:start position:0%
good thank you thank you I appreciate
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
the interpretation thank you
 
00:47:06.839 --> 00:47:08.790 align:start position:0%
the interpretation thank you
representative

00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
kofel uh thank you and thank you for
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question so would it make
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
sense at this point to to delay
 
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
implementation of the so the the force
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
the 4 a.m steps because right now we
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
have a a billing crisis and that's an
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
acute crisis this and correct me if I'm
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
wrong but if you run out of money you
 
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:33.880 align:start position:0%
can't do at some point you can't deliver
 
00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
Services right right so does it make
 
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
sense I mean potentially legislatively
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
to just sort of say we've got a a
 
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
four-step process but right now we got
 
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
to stop the
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
bleeding and then you know the the
 
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:49.480 align:start position:0%
followup to that question would be you
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
know and if we if we were to do
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
something like that what would the next
 
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
what would you envision as the next step
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
out of those four steps in the in the
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
study so thank you very much for your
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
question so um first off yes we need to
 
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
just take a breath and we need to fix
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
the problems that we have in front of us
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
deal with the acute nature of of the
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
issues secondly we need to um work on
 
00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
some financing that's not direct CMS
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
dollars so that people don't have to pay
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
that back immediately by December 31st
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
um and maybe we can take some State
 
00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319 align:start position:0%
funds swap that money out and then once
 
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:30.680 align:start position:0%
billing is been restored in full have
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
everyone Implement a repayment plan for
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
that so that way we can stabilize the
 
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
system and we can keep people working
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
and and all that um so those are the
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
first two things I would be doing the
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
the the second aspect of your question
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
is I I I don't think the order is out of
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
line I think you know their next steps
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
into doing rates and doing
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
evv I it doesn't matter to me I don't I
 
00:48:58.470 --> 00:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
don't think that matters I think what
 
00:49:01.549 --> 00:49:01.559 align:start position:0%
matters is just addressing the elephant
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
in the room right now that seems to be
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
crushing everyone um and again BDS has
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
been infusing people with cash as they
 
00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
need it
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
but what determines need and how bad is
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
does it need to get before you get it um
 
00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:21.160 align:start position:0%
so we had three days left before we had
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
no more cash to pay bills before we got
 
00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:23.950 align:start position:0%
no more cash to pay bills before we got
an

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
infusion so is at the level of need and
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
if that's the case why are we creating
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
so much stress I mean honest to God if I
 
00:49:33.829 --> 00:49:33.839 align:start position:0%
had hair I would have lost it all in the
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
last three months um you know it it's
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's one of those scenarios where like
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
I've talked to other CEOs they're just
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
vibrating from stress literally watching
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
them vibrate from stress so to your your
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
question it it doesn't matter what order
 
00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
we go in next they could put evv forward
 
00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:52.839 align:start position:0%
first or or what not um they've talked
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
about that they're going to not pursue
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
the the tier changes which I think is
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
good because it artificially capitates
 
00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.150 align:start position:0%
good because it artificially capitates
people's

00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
people's
 
00:50:04.109 --> 00:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
needs um and just because the state says
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
we're not going to pay X Y and Z dollars
 
00:50:08.109 --> 00:50:08.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that your needs don't far
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
in way exceed that um I do think that
 
00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
personally is a bad idea but the rest of
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
matter representative Merchant
 
00:50:20.309 --> 00:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
second thank you madam chair this is
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
again for uh our esteemed colleague
 
00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:23.870 align:start position:0%
again for uh our esteemed colleague
representative

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
Weber okay
 
00:50:29.309 --> 00:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
I I hear the concern in the short term
 
00:50:31.789 --> 00:50:31.799 align:start position:0%
about the issue of funding it's critical
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
to any organization profit or oper
 
00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
profit is it possible if BDS is up
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
against the wall with CMS can someone go
 
00:50:45.069 --> 00:50:45.079 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee and then ask for
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee to release funds
 
00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:51.640 align:start position:0%
that could temporarily back fill BDS in
 
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
order for them to meet the target with
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
CMS at the same time allow for the
 
00:50:59.549 --> 00:50:59.559 align:start position:0%
agencies to get Ridge loans is that
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
something we can do through fiscal
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
committee versus going through
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
legislative that's question one and the
 
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
other one if I understand this correctly
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
I would say that we're looking at a
 
00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
five-step process run step one which is
 
00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:15.799 align:start position:0%
not going well that instead of a pilot
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
program we build into it a process
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
through the bill that they have to do a
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
pilot on each step of the way because
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
that it's going to take time and
 
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
depending upon step two you do a pilot
 
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
for step two and see how it works you do
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
a pilot for step three and see how it
 
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
works and a pilot for step four before
 
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:39.160 align:start position:0%
you make it broad is that kind of the
 
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
concept so it's two things one is R
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
whatever where can we find the money and
 
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
then number two can we possibly think
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
about this not so much a pilot per se
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
for everything but a pilot for each
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
stage yes please the answer to number
 
00:51:58.349 --> 00:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
one is I have no idea my guess is that
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal has a great deal of ability to do
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
stuff but representative Edwards being
 
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:06.280 align:start position:0%
on finance would have a great deal more
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
information than I would about that
 
00:52:09.839 --> 00:52:11.589 align:start position:0%
information than I would about that
um

00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
yeah but
 
00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
um I I too was thinking in the same
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
direction of we have four more steps and
 
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
if we are going to do something with the
 
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.670 align:start position:0%
if we are going to do something with the
bill

00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
it would make sense to require a pilot
 
00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
on each of the four
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
steps representative Edwards so so just
 
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
to speak to the first question about the
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
authority of the fiscal committee as I
 
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
understand the authority of the fiscal
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
committee we do two things we approve
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
the acceptance of federal money that's
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
coming to us and the second thing we do
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
is we approve requests for
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
reallocation within the existing budget
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
to move money from from one part of an
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
approved budget to another we do not I
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
think typically have the authority to uh
 
00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
authorize or approp effectively
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate additional money it's we our
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
Authority stays within the existing
 
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
budget that's been approved I believe
 
00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
Merchant re represent Edwards thank you
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
for that clarification so basically in
 
00:53:24.319 --> 00:53:25.910 align:start position:0%
for that clarification so basically in
my

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
opinion that money is s sort of fungible
 
00:53:31.109 --> 00:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
so in other words what the fiscal
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
committee could do if I understand this
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
correctly is you could give the
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Health Human Services
 
00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's where BDS resides the ability to
 
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
move money from one bucket to another
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
bucket temporarily to get them through
 
00:53:42.079 --> 00:53:43.270 align:start position:0%
bucket temporarily to get them through
this

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
process yes I I would just uh reorder
 
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
the steps the the uh fiscal request has
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
to originate with the executive branch
 
00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:54.799 align:start position:0%
and then it comes to the fiscal
 
00:53:57.549 --> 00:53:57.559 align:start position:0%
committee as a request and so then we
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
review and potentially approve the
 
00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:01.960 align:start position:0%
request but if the department doesn't
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
ask it we don't make them move
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
money sorry and clarifying that by it
 
00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
coming from the executive branch that's
 
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
coming from the Department um
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
specifically the department is a part of
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
the executive branch yeah
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
so I N Nathan white is their CFO he he
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
would have to basically at some point
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
it thank
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
you and and then uh represent Mar to
 
00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
follow up on your your question doing it
 
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
step by step makes the most amount of
 
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
sense I I think a a pilot project for
 
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
each part in implementation would it
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
slow down the process dramatically I'm
 
00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
sure it would but at the end of the day
 
00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about people's lifetimes
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
you know a couple years to get to where
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
they want to go with this I don't think
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
is an unreasonable
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
ask representative nichel thank you for
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman thanks for taking my
 
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:03.799 align:start position:0%
question I'm getting better at doing
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
this it's been six months um as
 
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards said I'm in
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
private medical practice my world I know
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
is very different than yours um the
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
reason why my practice is so successful
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
is because they don't let me near the
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
billing um with that said I do see the
 
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
financials every month and I do know
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
that um um
 
00:55:28.109 --> 00:55:28.119 align:start position:0%
whenever um we change the way we collect
 
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
money that there's always a burp and
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
that our collection rate time changes
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
and we freak out for a couple months and
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
then all of the sudden we just get a
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
huge infusion of cash um when we catch
 
00:55:42.309 --> 00:55:42.319 align:start position:0%
up is there any possibility that that's
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
going to happen here yeah that's that's
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're being told is going
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
to happen but the problem is as we get
 
00:55:50.990 --> 00:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
through one problem we get to the next
 
00:55:52.309 --> 00:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
and as we get to the next problem we get
 
00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:54.559 align:start position:0%
to the next so this was all supposed to
 
00:55:57.029 --> 00:55:57.039 align:start position:0%
be resolved OLED by mid July and then it
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be resolved by mid
 
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:01.000 align:start position:0%
August and then by mid September and now
 
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
we're in mid October and now we're being
 
00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
told it'll resolve by December 31st when
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
we had our meeting this week we were
 
00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
being told that we need to give a
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
repayment plan something uh to BDS and
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
my response was pay us in full and I
 
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:20.680 align:start position:0%
will pay you in full I will cut a check
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
the same day we get our money and if
 
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
that works for you that works for me but
 
00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:29.799 align:start position:0%
we're not going to agreee to anything um
 
00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:31.720 align:start position:0%
you know and and in the form that they
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
submitted to all of us one of the things
 
00:56:35.829 --> 00:56:35.839 align:start position:0%
that really irked me was it saids that
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
once you agree to this repayment plan
 
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
that they were trying to get everyone to
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
do you can't contest it you can't
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
augment it you have to accept it and you
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
wave all your rights to be able to do
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
that to me it's just we're worrying
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
about CMS and I have to I've worked with
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
CMS in other parts of the country
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
if we're this concerned with CMS there
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
is a reason why and I would highly
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
recommend delving into why we're this
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
concerned with C we're not listening
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
that something needs to happen and now
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
they no longer are willing to give us
 
00:57:14.349 --> 00:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
what we need any which way that needs to
 
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:16.240 align:start position:0%
probably be addressed there needs to be
 
00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
someone looking at that specifically
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
because I've never had an experience
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
with CMS where they've been anything
 
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
other than helpful and um I mean there's
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
always been issues like Florida I was in
 
00:57:28.589 --> 00:57:28.599 align:start position:0%
Florida when Florida actually went
 
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
through a similar transition as New
 
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we had a couple months where
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
there was no payment but Florida turned
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
around and said hey this is what the
 
00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:37.799 align:start position:0%
issue is it's a software issue if you
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
need money come to us but they fixed
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
that issue within a month and a
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
half so we're just so far beyond that
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
point at this point uh and again you
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
have great people at BDS working these
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
issues daily but if we had had a pilot
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
program we wouldn't have this issue can
 
00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
I one yes one more um so several times
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
you said we need to take a deep stop
 
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
take a deep breath who actually stops
 
00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
and takes a deep breath is that us or is
 
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
that who that that's BDS that's DHHS and
 
00:58:15.069 --> 00:58:15.079 align:start position:0%
we have no control over that uh it's I
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
think legislatively with this with this
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh piece of legislation you would
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
because you'd be commanding them to not
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
move any not move forward without doing
 
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
a pilot program
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
and I just with everything going on and
 
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
you have to understand that people at
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
BDS are just as stressed as we are
 
00:58:34.029 --> 00:58:34.039 align:start position:0%
because they're trying to fix this whole
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
monster of a mess and yet now either
 
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
someone's directing them to or they're
 
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
taking upon themselves to start
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
implementing the next steps when we have
 
00:58:47.349 --> 00:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
this Quagmire of an issue that's
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
dragging everyone down representative
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
Merchant thank you madam chair but that
 
00:58:55.390 --> 00:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
is my concern right now even though we
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
may talk about doing each phase as a
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
pilot there's nothing at this point in
 
00:59:03.029 --> 00:59:03.039 align:start position:0%
time because in order for this to become
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
effective it won't happen until next
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
summer so is the department on a
 
00:59:11.309 --> 00:59:11.319 align:start position:0%
timeline to implement all five stages
 
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
before next summer because if it is this
 
00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.430 align:start position:0%
before next summer because if it is this
becomes

00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:18.440 align:start position:0%
relevant I don't know if they're on a
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
timeline the things that were of concern
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
that there was a CMS timeline for were
 
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
the things that needed to be implemented
 
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
on July 1st of this year and that was
 
00:59:30.309 --> 00:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
the direct Bill and conflict free case
 
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
management so those two things were
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
implemented on July 1st so that's the
 
00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
First Act of this play that we're in the
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
middle of um the rate changes are not
 
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
required by CMS I know that so there's
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
no reason that that can't be stopped and
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
halted evv is a um a system requirement
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
from CMS the uh electronic visit
 
00:59:53.549 --> 00:59:53.559 align:start position:0%
verification um but I don't understand
 
00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
why we can't ask for a way favor on that
 
00:59:59.029 --> 00:59:59.039 align:start position:0%
um because that is not a a item that's
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
been out there for a decade plus like
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
one thank you I think we've had a lot of
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
good information here um I think that we
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
need to figure out from the Department
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
um what insight there is and speaking to
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
people around the country it seems that
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
other states have been able to um have a
 
01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
firmer relationship with CMS and I think
 
01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:23.720 align:start position:0%
our role as legislators in requiring
 
01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
them to take process yes they can take a
 
01:00:27.789 --> 01:00:27.799 align:start position:0%
considered process but if the
 
01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
legislature requires it it gives them a
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
little bit more backing as they're
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
working with CMS so I want to thank you
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
gentlemen for being here and offering
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
this Insight um and I was wondering if
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
you um if you would like to speak for
 
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.230 align:start position:0%
you um if you would like to speak for
the

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
Department yes I I should have issued an
 
01:00:48.029 --> 01:00:48.039 align:start position:0%
Ethics disclosure at the beginning of
 
01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
and I just say it now yes you may okay
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
so everything I've said today is in my
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
role as State Rep I also happen to sit
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
on the board of one sky I was not
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of one sky at any
 
01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
point I was speaking on behalf of what I
 
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
think is taking place
 
01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
systemwide and I happen to have
 
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge of one sky to which I'm
 
01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:17.559 align:start position:0%
extrapolating the impact across the
 
01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
entire system so okay um so in case
 
01:01:23.549 --> 01:01:23.559 align:start position:0%
anyone's worried that I was testifying
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
as a one sky board member I was
 
01:01:30.029 --> 01:01:30.039 align:start position:0%
representing my my role in the legisl
 
01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Edwards
 
01:01:33.029 --> 01:01:33.039 align:start position:0%
since you weren't at the microphone in
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
case there is anybody listening
 
01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards was speaking in
 
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
his role as a legislator not as board or
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
anything else even though he's a board
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon Madam chair U members
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Melissa nth
 
01:01:58.829 --> 01:01:58.839 align:start position:0%
I am the attorney and legislative
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
liaison for the Bureau of Developmental
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
Services uh and so I think you know a
 
01:02:06.269 --> 01:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
lot of some of the things that um Mr

cord was speaking about he was giving
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
some kudos to the department um and so I
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
think that's very much appreciated and
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
the department does recognize as he
 
01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
indicated that there were some you know
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
some problems with billing and really
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
has taken some concerted efforts to work
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
with individual ageny is to make sure
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
that these things are getting sorted out
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
going forward um and so what I'm what
 
01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:33.799 align:start position:0%
I'm told is that there there are staff
 
01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
at the bureau that are working directly
 
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
with uh on Sky to try to help and deal
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
with any issues there were um as this
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
was rolling out there were issues on the
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
department side there were issues on the
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
area agency side um and I think we're
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
trying to work the department is trying
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
to work to make sure it's clarified its
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
own issues and working with the region
 
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
to help assist with any issues they may
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
still have um I'm told that some of
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
these issues are um happen to be
 
01:03:05.309 --> 01:03:05.319 align:start position:0%
specific to this one Area Agency uh not
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
that not to say that the that that's a
 
01:03:09.309 --> 01:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
good or bad thing but just to say there
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
are specific and so the department is
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
vested in working with them through
 
01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
whatever issues those might be to ensure
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
these things are going to happen going
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
forward um as far as the the rest of the
 
01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
system is concerned with the direct
 
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
billing as of got to get my notes here
 
01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.029 align:start position:0%
billing as of got to get my notes here
I'm

01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
sorry as of the end of September 88% of
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
the providers that had active service
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
authorizations with the Department have
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
build on those authorizations um so
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
that's encouraging to see that any
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
issues that were there are you know it's
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
not to say they they're perfect but
 
01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:50.839 align:start position:0%
they're being worked on in the fact that
 
01:03:52.789 --> 01:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
88% of providers that had these service
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
authorizations have built on those um
 
01:03:59.750 --> 01:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
only about 3 months into this system I
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
think is really encouraging um so with
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
that I'd be happy to take if there are
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
any specific questions I will do my best
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
to answer them and maybe that I don't
 
01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
have that information today we may need
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
to take that back but I'll do my best um
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um before I recognize
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I had one question
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
from your statement you said that 80 88%
 
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
of providers with authorizations have
 
01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
built how many are waiting on
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
authorizations that I don't know I would
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
have to ask I'm sorry I don't have that
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
information today thank you
 
01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.589 align:start position:0%
information today thank you
representative

01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:34.349 --> 01:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
Weber so I'm just trying to get at the
 
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
end end
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
question um if we were to
 
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.630 align:start position:0%
question um if we were to
pass

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
a what is the Department's position on
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
the passage of
 
01:04:52.269 --> 01:04:52.279 align:start position:0%
um basic what is basically this bill
 
01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
only applied to the four remaining
 
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
stages of the
 
01:04:59.190 --> 01:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
implementation so the department doesn't
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
feel that there needs to be uh that
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
these need to be stopped and there
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
although there are kind of four I would
 
01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:06.799 align:start position:0%
call them elements that are going to be
 
01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
implemented rather than stages because a
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
lot of things are happen happening
 
01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
simultaneously um so the Department's
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
plan to give you an overview for the
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
rest of this year um is to continue to
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
work specifically with with all
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholders but most importantly with
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
individuals and families um
 
01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
before you know learning all the
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
information they can despite and this
 
01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
has been going on this is not new um
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
there have been
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
354 stakeholder meetings um since the
 
01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
fall of 2021 and when I say stakeholders
 
01:05:41.789 --> 01:05:41.799 align:start position:0%
that's a variety that includes the area
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
agencies families providers um everyone
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
across the system so that those efforts
 
01:05:52.029 --> 01:05:52.039 align:start position:0%
are going to continue and one of the the
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
next steps is to make some changes to
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
the waiver services and the department
 
01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:00.200 align:start position:0%
is continuing to before going forward
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
with that is making every effort to
 
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
ensure they've heard from families to
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
make sure that before these things roll
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
out and service Services get change that
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
they are being included um you you heard
 
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of reference to rates um the
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
department is engaged with uh another
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
consultant Myers and stoer uh who is
 
01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
working on the rate development and so
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
that is uh continuing to go forward as
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
well with getting there's been a lot of
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
work that's gone into that um and I know
 
01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
you had asked about some some deadlines
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
again I would have to get specifics I'm
 
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
not I don't have that information with
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
me today but um I don't know where the
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
department is at in so far as its
 
01:06:46.510 --> 01:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
contracts with with these various
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
contractors and what the um metrics are
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
for completion in those that those may
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
have some timelines although I don't
 
01:06:57.789 --> 01:06:57.799 align:start position:0%
know that specifically um so that may be
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
while it's not a CMS deadline um that
 
01:07:02.349 --> 01:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
may be something that the department is
 
01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
work representative
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
merch it's encouraging thank you for the
 
01:07:14.269 --> 01:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
question also thank you for the chair
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
it's encouraging to hear the 88%
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
number I would be interested though to
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
understand if understand the agency
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
there 10 in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:26.200 align:start position:0%
and therefore is that 80% apply to every
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
single one collectively or can we get a
 
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
breakdown by agency building is one
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
thing receiving cash is another thing so
 
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:35.960 align:start position:0%
just because they built it doesn't mean
 
01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
that we actually paid it so I'm looking
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
for okay what's the payment against that
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
88% if we get 10% payment against the 80
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
88% build that's not going to help them
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
in a cash flow
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
point I can I can look into that I don't
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
think I have the information on that I'm
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
looking to see if that was anything that
 
01:07:59.549 --> 01:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
was provided to me
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
um if I may sure I think it's a critical
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
point because just because something was
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
built to the
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
system is
 
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
encouraging however the real issue I
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
think right now is the cash flow what's
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
coming back from the State against those
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
invoices that were build because that's
 
01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
where the I think a lot of the pressure
 
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
is coming from is they're not getting
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
the cash from the state to pay their
 
01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
bills I don't know the specific
 
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
percentage of that um but there were
 
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
there is an electronic billing system
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
and I there were some difficulties with
 
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
that and so the department as a way to
 
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:37.880 align:start position:0%
help actually did some manual billing
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
and invoicing um and so at this point
 
01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:42.759 align:start position:0%
and again this was through the end of
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
September and I don't know the total
 
01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:45.759 align:start position:0%
amount that was buil so I know it
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't get specifically to your
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
question but to give you an idea of the
 
01:08:51.070 --> 01:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
amount of money that's been paid out um
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
the electronic system processed $43
 
01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:54.510 align:start position:0%
the electronic system processed $43
million

01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:08:57.390 --> 01:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
and manually $44 million were processed
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
so 87 million did go out in payments but
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
again I don't know specifically how much
 
01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
was built so I would have to look into
 
01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:07.719 align:start position:0%
that um thank you and before uh I would
 
01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
really appreciate getting the
 
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
information on the number that are still
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
waiting for prior authorizations the
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
number of providers who are billing the
 
01:09:22.749 --> 01:09:22.759 align:start position:0%
num the impact on the area agencies um
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
and their ability to operate and
 
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
continue to provide their vital service
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
and also seeing where the manual billing
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
versus the electronic billing is because
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
um the fact that 3 months in over half
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
of it is being done through manual
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
billing thank you for getting people
 
01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
paid but that that's not showing that
 
01:09:48.829 --> 01:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
the electronic system is yet as robust
 
01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
as it needs to be I my understanding is
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
there's a plan at that deoy here we go
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
with another consultant that the
 
01:09:58.270 --> 01:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
department is working with um is
 
01:09:59.709 --> 01:09:59.719 align:start position:0%
planning to have that fixed I think I
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
was told by next Friday um and I don't
 
01:10:04.149 --> 01:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
know if that fixes everything if that
 
01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
fixes part of it but I know it is in the
 
01:10:08.709 --> 01:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
in the works who really there's a big
 
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
effort to get that all fixed but I can
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
get more specifics for you thank you yes
 
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
the more specifics the better and um
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
with my experience in the business world
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
the more more Consultants you have
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
operating the more potential for chaos
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
um especially when you're taking on
 
01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.590 align:start position:0%
um especially when you're taking on
multiple

01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.709 align:start position:0%
multiple
projects

01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:10:27.719 --> 01:10:29.270 align:start position:0%
projects
um

01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:32.280 align:start position:0%
see um I I think that we absolutely need
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
to have more information on this and it
 
01:10:38.189 --> 01:10:38.199 align:start position:0%
determine how big of a problem this is
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
because it sounds like the department
 
01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
seeing the successes that have happened
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
which is good and I'm glad that there
 
01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:45.640 align:start position:0%
are those successes but I want to make
 
01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
sure that the actual experience on the
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
ground on these providers is also
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
showing success before you move into
 
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
more steps and uh more of these
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
important and challenging changes to the
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
system um just representative
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
Weber I agree I agree and and so it
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
seems clear to me that we're going to
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
need at least one more meeting yes um
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
and time is short and I am missing
 
01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon's voice saying
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
while we're still young uh but I'm
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
wondering how to proceed could you
 
01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
remind me because there have been so
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
many different subcommittees is this one
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
that was noticed in the calendar or is
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
this one that was given this was noticed
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
in the calendar we have one other
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
outstanding subcommittee on the two-
 
01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
tiered waiver system that's largely made
 
01:11:41.229 --> 01:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
up of the same members so if we meet at
 
01:11:43.229 --> 01:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
the same time same day for though that
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
and this that would help make us uh be a
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more efficient on our timing
 
01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
um so I just I just feel that this is a
 
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
big enough issue that calendar notice is
 
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
a really makes me feel a lot better
 
01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
about what we're doing and I'm going to
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
retract a lot of what I said earlier
 
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
because I thought that there was a
 
01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
restriction in the bill that I can't
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
find so it's not there um but I I I do
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
think we need to have at least one
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
more um meeting where we have a
 
01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
considerable amount more information and
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
um you know I think I think we need to
 
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
hear from the people who are doing the
 
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.669 align:start position:0%
hear from the people who are doing the
implementing

01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
implementing
 
01:12:31.149 --> 01:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
because if we don't hear from them that
 
01:12:31.159 --> 01:12:32.950 align:start position:0%
because if we don't hear from them that
this

01:12:32.950 --> 01:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
is you know I I'm far from convinced
 
01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
that a solution is happening and
 
01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
um so I think it would be very helpful
 
01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
to hear from the people who are doing
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
the implementing
 
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
about specifically the effects of
 
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
requiring specifically that each each uh
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
of the other four elements have a pilot
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
program and I see no reason why the
 
01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.669 --> 01:13:12.679 align:start position:0%
proceed I I wouldn't go as far as saying
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
you can't start on the next one before
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
you finish the last one but because I
 
01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
don't have enough knowledge of the
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
process but I'd really like some
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
feedback by the people who will have to
 
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
do the implement
 
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
about what the effect of doing that
 
01:13:30.430 --> 01:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
would have on their operations
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
directly I think that would be very
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
helpful I I know I personally um I had
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
reached out to associate commissioner
 
01:13:38.189 --> 01:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
santanello to see if she was able to
 
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
make this meeting and it didn't fit her
 
01:13:41.629 --> 01:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
calendar um I definitely would want to
 
01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
schedule it when she can come here as
 
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
well because I think this is a lot of
 
01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
coordination um and we want to make sure
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
that since she is coordinating for the
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Department of Developmental
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
services that we make sure sure that we
 
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
understand what she's seeing as well so
 
01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
that we can make sure that we're all
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
moving forward in the in the most
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
productive way in order to get these
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
Services when next uh we will need to
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
schedule that so we will query out to
 
01:14:07.229 --> 01:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
ourselves we will query out to her as
 
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
well um so that we can get something
 
01:14:11.709 --> 01:14:11.719 align:start position:0%
noticed um we'll have to notice it by
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday so that we can get into
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
that following
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
calendar so we're looking at Halloween a
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
week folks most
 
01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
likely hopefully it won't be as scary as
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
all of the tricks
 
01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
so you don't want to pull the committee
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
now on their availability um we could do
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
that um I was the other bill that talk
 
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
about were meeting uh we haven't
 
01:14:36.750 --> 01:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
scheduled the other Bill 317 yet um it's
 
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
largely the same same members the one
 
01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
who's not on this committee is already
 
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
here today with US Representative n upam
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
so we uh we could pull on the
 
01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
availability for that week I think that
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
might help and then if we could give the
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner our our
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
work well and and as soon as you know
 
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
let let's pull our calendars I'm going
 
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
to have to pull mine because um just I'm
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
moving pieces with all my different
 
01:15:07.990 --> 01:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
people and what they're trying to deal
 
01:15:09.629 --> 01:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
with at home so we'll do that we'll get
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
this noticed as soon as we can we'll
 
01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
reach out to the associate you're going
 
01:15:14.669 --> 01:15:14.679 align:start position:0%
to do that via email I think we should
 
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
do that via email all right yes no
 
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
problem fantastic this has been um
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
incredibly helpful um I really
 
01:15:24.189 --> 01:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate understanding just the depth
 
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
of these challenges because we're not
 
01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
always we don't always always have
 
01:15:29.629 --> 01:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
visibility into the consequences of our
 
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
actions and the department action so
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I really look
 
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
forward to finding a good solution uh M
 
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes if I could from the
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
Department do you have a list of the
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
agencies and how I could possibly reach
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
out to them we've heard from one sky
 
01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
which is tremendous thank you both for
 
01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
being here three of you but I'd like to
 
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
listen to the other agencies as well if
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
I had to make a personal phone call to
 
01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
them to understand what issues they're
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
having as
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
well um I might suggest that we divide
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
that list up I mean I think some of us
 
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
like I already know some of the folks at
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
gateways I could reach out to them but
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
that would make for a division of labor
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
and I think we could each come back to
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
the next uh to the next meeting with
 
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
some some input um and when I said there
 
01:16:20.149 --> 01:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
are 10 area agencies but because of the
 
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
requirements of CMS that provid as a
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
service have opportunity to directly
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
bill for services themselves there are
 
01:16:29.669 --> 01:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
now many more agencies that are billing
 
01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
than just those 10 area agencies um so I
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
I can easily get a list of the area
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
agencies and I believe on the
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
Department's website there is a list of
 
01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
all the providers enrolled to provide
 
01:16:44.669 --> 01:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
each type of service um it's a very
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
lengthy list I and so I can we can get
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
that link um if it's helpful I can get
 
01:16:51.870 --> 01:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
that directly to the the chair um get
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
that information to her and you can go
 
01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
from there if that's helpful yeah if we
 
01:16:56.669 --> 01:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
could get the link I think that would be
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
very helpful the link would be wonderful
 
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes the website's a little harder
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
to access when you AR design involved in
 
01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
designing it yes you refer to the the
 
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
providers I me understand something to
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
help me anyways one is you have the
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
agency is the way it was before the
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
agency did the building on behalf of the
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
providers now the providers can build
 
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
directly to Medicaid that's correct yes
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
that's part of the corrective action
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
plan that the was under was that because
 
01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
we did not previously allow that so is
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
the goal here ultimately is for the
 
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
yes and that's a CMS
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
Rule and reason I'm shaking my head is I
 
01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:42.669 align:start position:0%
Rule and reason I'm shaking my head is I
have

01:17:42.669 --> 01:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:17:45.550 --> 01:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
a a daughter who is a physical therapist
 
01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
and she cringes at the idea of doing
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
billing herself and it's the requirement
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
is that we have the state has to provide
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
that opport Unity if an agency does not
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
want to bill for itself it can engage
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
with a trading partner it has that
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity but the where the state had
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
to come into the corrective action plan
 
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
is we did not previously allow them the
 
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity if they wanted
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
to um and then as far as information um
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
we also have um some of those questions
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
about whether some funds could be
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
requested to be reallocated in order to
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
cover this as a longer term Bridge until
 
01:18:21.149 --> 01:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
the system is fully functioning so we
 
01:18:22.629 --> 01:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
would like to have information on that I
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
know that that would need to go to
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal but I think that would go a long
 
01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
way for us to feel better about what the
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
process is so we can stay involved and
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
then it sounded like there was also an
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
issue around the room and board billing
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
that I guess had been previously wrapped
 
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
I I assume it had been previously
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
wrapped up into other issues but I want
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that right now all of our
 
01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
constituents are having trouble paying
 
01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
their bills we have an obligation to pay
 
01:18:46.229 --> 01:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
for that room in board for the people
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
who are served by BDS um how can we make
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
sure that that line item has what's
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
necessary so that they can afford to so
 
01:18:55.149 --> 01:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
that the people providing Services can
 
01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
keep a roof over their head and food on
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
their plate so have that information as
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
well would be very helpful okay okay
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further requests
 
01:19:05.310 --> 01:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
that's so complex we may end up
 
01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
following up with a couple emails as
 
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
well sorry thank you and
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
actually and for D thank you so much for
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
being here yes and then with one other
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
request I would highly recommend that
 
01:19:23.229 --> 01:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
you folks take the opportunity to reach
 
01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
out to the private provider Network and
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
speak to their director they represent
 
01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority of the um the
 
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
vendor agencies in our state and I think
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
they would be much more comfortable
 
01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
having a private conversation than one
 
01:19:43.229 --> 01:19:43.239 align:start position:0%
that is going to be publicly broadcasted
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
based upon the conversations I've had
 
01:19:50.110 --> 01:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
with uh many of those members um there's
 
01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:53.719 align:start position:0%
a a very palpable concern of sharing
 
01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
information will lead to not receiving
 
01:19:58.510 --> 01:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
funds with that being said I haven't
 
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
seen anything that would substantiate
 
01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
that but let alone I it's a concern that
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
is very widely
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
shared thank you if you could provide
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
that information to me I can send that
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
out in a collective email once I get all
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
of these different contact points and
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
that concern is one we deal with on
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
other bills we have plenty of people who
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
will speak to us but the last thing they
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
want to do is face potential
 
01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:25.470 align:start position:0%
want to do is face potential
retribution

01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
I unless anybody else has uh any
 
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
anything else to say I believe that uh
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
we will pull the members for our
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
availability speak with the associate
 
01:20:36.590 --> 01:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner and then see when we'll be
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
meeting again so thank you very much
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.719 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
adored
