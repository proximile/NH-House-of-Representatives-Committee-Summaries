yes

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
this is the committee on commissions
 
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
and this is September 11th
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
2023 let me say we're not going to say
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
the Pledge of Allegiance we don't have
 
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
that as our custom on this committee but
 
00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:15.959 align:start position:0%
I I would like to take a moment of
 
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
silence to remember the sacrifices uh on
 
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
that come on the sacrifices on 9 11 and
 
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
that we all think back that was
 
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
a long time ago but let's never forget
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
so let's just take a moment to remember
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
all those who died especially the folks
 
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
in New York and the Pentagon and
 
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:53.449 align:start position:0%
in New York and the Pentagon and
Pennsylvania

00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
today we're going to uh
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
dive back into this project well welcome
 
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.140 align:start position:0%

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
here we are in September uh kicking
 
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
this there should you should all have an
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
agenda in front of you
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to go through through the
 
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
agenda and then uh
 
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you that John and I met with
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
the speaker
 
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.590 align:start position:0%
the speaker
huh

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
huh
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago in late
 
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
in late June
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
and I'll debriefs with you about the
 
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
speaker's comments
 
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
and where we are and also have some some
 
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:48.380 align:start position:0%
things some goals we'd like to achieve
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
during this
 
00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:53.579 align:start position:0%
uh next few months
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
today is uh is Legend week so this is
 
00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
the week that if you want to put in
 
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.530 align:start position:0%
the week that if you want to put in
legislation

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
and we're certainly not ready in this
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
committee to Output legislation yet so
 
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
it won't really affect us but there's a
 
00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779 align:start position:0%
lot of people scurrying around getting
 
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
their legislative comments into
 
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.170 align:start position:0%
their legislative comments into
uh

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
into the folks downstairs uh across the
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh across the road so
 
00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:23.579 align:start position:0%
we need to respect that activity that
 
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
it's only going to last a week
 
00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.930 align:start position:0%
it's only going to last a week
so

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
but I I have I do have some news for you
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
in that regard and how it will apply to
 
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
this committee but we'll go over that in
 
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
a little while uh after we've heard from
 
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
our special guests so Deb if you'd like
 
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
to take it from here for the next next
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
few that's
 
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
good that's a thank you so much Mr
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
chairman all committee members
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing us time again to
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
come back and share some of the updates
 
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
that we've accomplished over the summer
 
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
and we have some more information to
 
00:12:00.769 --> 00:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
provide to you and help you do
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
um make your decisions and do your job
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
more effectively hopefully
 
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
agenda we're going to review uh just
 
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
give a high level review of our meeting
 
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
from May 22nd and then dive into some of
 
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
our Improvement opportunities the master
 
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
list that we've talked about continuing
 
00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:19.019 align:start position:0%
education proposals the tri-fold that
 
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.459 align:start position:0%
we've we've talked about having
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
available through OLS and then
 
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
committees that could potentially be
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
reviewed to to repeal
 
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
so starting out with a review of the May
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
22nd meeting and so um I'm Ann
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald director of house community
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
services and as you know we're Staffing
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
your um special committee and uh back on
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
May 22nd you charged staff with five
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
things to do and Deborah just listed
 
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:49.860 align:start position:0%
them and that's why we that was
 
00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:51.899 align:start position:0%
basically the
 
00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:52.910 align:start position:0%
basically the
um

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
what we decided uh to move forward you
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
needed us to track down this information
 
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
for you which we have done if we don't
 
00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:02.779 align:start position:0%
have the information
 
00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519 align:start position:0%
completed we definitely have an update
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
on what we have been working on
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
throughout the summer so that's what we
 
00:13:12.769 --> 00:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
so the the master list the master list
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
was the list of statutory and study
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
committees that you guys are are looking
 
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.430 align:start position:0%
committees that you guys are are looking
for

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
um we have we went back and forth on
 
00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:27.240 align:start position:0%
this because we all right now staff the
 
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
different departments have their own
 
00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet because we have different
 
00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
fields where we need different
 
00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
information my role and I'm sorry I
 
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
didn't introduce myself Deborah child's
 
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
Deputy Chief of Staff and the only
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
reason I don't have my name tag on is
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
because my desk is all packed up there's
 
00:13:43.129 --> 00:13:43.139 align:start position:0%
some furniture movement going on
 
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
um but so I have my master list house
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
committee Services has one the Senate
 
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
has one and what we're really trying to
 
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
do is get to one list that everybody can
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
access so we working with it now have an
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
export function from these statutory and
 
00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
study committee page up on the screen
 
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
here this is the statutory and study
 
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
committee search page is everybody
 
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
familiar with this
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
oh is that hard to say it's where you
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
can go in and search for a committee
 
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
using the RSA or the name or a text
 
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
search so today a lot of folks use this
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
to find information who's appointed to
 
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
what committee what committees exist we
 
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
are still working to clean up the data
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
however an easier way for us to do this
 
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
and give folks the function to be able
 
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:37.260 align:start position:0%
to pull all of the data out of the
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
system is we've created this new section
 
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
here export committee details
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
and if you can't see it sorry I'll send
 
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
a link out after the meeting too just to
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody has access to the
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
page and you can find this export
 
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.470 align:start position:0%
page and you can find this export
function

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
so it's export committee details and for
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
right now you can search active
 
00:14:58.009 --> 00:14:58.019 align:start position:0%
statutory committees
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
and active study committees you could do
 
00:15:02.449 --> 00:15:02.459 align:start position:0%
one or the other there is the
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
possibility of doing archived as well
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
however because the we're only focusing
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
on cleanup of the data of active
 
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
committees we don't have the archived in
 
00:15:14.689 --> 00:15:14.699 align:start position:0%
the search if that's something that you
 
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
would require that you think would be
 
00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
helpful there's about 1500 I believe
 
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
archived statutory and study committees
 
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
if you want that information all
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
upstairs yes exactly but for now so if
 
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:30.180 align:start position:0%
we want to export this data it exports
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
into like a spreadsheet it's called a
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
CSV but I'm going to export all active
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
statutory committees and active study
 
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:47.579 align:start position:0%
and then it exports and I'm sorry we're
 
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
having technical problems before so no I
 
00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.689 align:start position:0%
having technical problems before so no I
can't

00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:50.699 align:start position:0%
can't
 
00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:52.610 align:start position:0%
can't
um

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:55.019 align:start position:0%
there we go sorry this is not my laptop
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
because we were having technical
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
problems but it exports into this export
 
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
CSV and if you open it up
 
00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
it provides all of the active statutory
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
and study committees and commissions
 
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.009 align:start position:0%
and study committees and commissions
boards

00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:10.019 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:16:11.689 --> 00:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
all of them
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and you can see all the
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
columns at once I'm just doing this
 
00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:23.339 align:start position:0%
demonstration so you see how simple it
 
00:16:24.889 --> 00:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
is I'll send you the link you can find
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
the export it's basically just pushing
 
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
the button and it opens it up in Excel
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
now the reason you'll see multiple lines
 
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
for every single commission is because
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
this is pulling out all the appointments
 
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
so administrative rules for example has
 
00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
multiple Senate and and speaker
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
appointments so there's a line item for
 
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
every appointee
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
we this is our second iteration of this
 
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
export function so we're hoping to have
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
more not hoping we will have more Fields
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
eventually which you know as we work on
 
00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:55.259 align:start position:0%
cleaning out this data we'll have more
 
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
Fields available to you but we have some
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
of the key Fields exported now which
 
00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
will have the you know the committee or
 
00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
commission name uh effective date if
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
there's a repeal date and it will have a
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
list of the appointees the RSA number
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
and information like that so our goal is
 
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about and spreadsheet
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
or Deborah's spreadsheet and picking
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
that apart we have one export and if
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
there are issues which there are some
 
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
data issues we get that fixed in the
 
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:25.500 align:start position:0%
system this is a huge first step for us
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
from a staff perspective because we're
 
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
looking at all kinds of potential
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
improvements and ways we can use it to
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you that's great
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.289 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:00.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
history and you have to go down to the
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
bottom representative go all the way
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
down to the bottom and you see in the
 
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
black ribbon down we'd like to move it
 
00:18:09.169 --> 00:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
up but you have to go all the way down
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
to the bottom ribbon and it'll say
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
statutory and steady
 
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.870 align:start position:0%
statutory and steady
um

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.710 align:start position:0%
um
committees

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
and and then that that will lead you to
 
00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:22.190 align:start position:0%
and and then that that will lead you to
it

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
and now as I mentioned uh
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
you know this is going to be huge for us
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
to help validate and clean up the data
 
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
so please don't get frustrated if you if
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
you look at a committee and you see
 
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
somebody who isn't even a House member
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
anymore for example and they're listed
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
in here this is a great opportunity we
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
haven't had this before we now have this
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
we're working to automate a lot of
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
manual processes so so please be patient
 
00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:50.220 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions at all you can
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
always reach out to me reach out to Ann
 
00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:54.419 align:start position:0%
and her team and I've got a question for
 
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
you is is this more than single use what
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
I mean that is can multiple people
 
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
access the state at the same time
 
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
absolutely and one of the great things
 
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
so you could take this export the data
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
and then you have your own
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that you could potentially
 
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
work from however once we update the
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
data it's live so if you run a you could
 
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
run an export now and then you could run
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
an export in 20 minutes and there could
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
be something different yeah my concern
 
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
was it doesn't lock anybody out so if
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
I'm in there looking around doesn't lock
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
John out no it's all real time okay okay
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
and then at the bottom of the export
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
um something we had asked it to put at
 
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
the bottom was the total number so if
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
you scroll to the bottom of the the
 
00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:38.039 align:start position:0%
export you'll see the total number of
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
statutory commissions which I believe
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
was 156 when I last did the export and
 
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
then study committees and that was in
 
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
the 20s or 30s
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
yeah can you do from the top can you do
 
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
keyword circuits on certain you know to
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
see if it pulls up this committee is
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
like this committee is like this
 
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
committee so this is where our
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
duplication can
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
you can on on this search page you can
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
search on text text is often very
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
helpful you know I I often use the RSA
 
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
or the committee name but the keyword
 
00:20:15.409 --> 00:20:15.419 align:start position:0%
you could type marijuana for example to
 
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
see if there are multiple marijuana
 
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
commissions yeah cool okay now uh them
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're going to
 
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
try to do this fall is
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
is sort the data
 
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
by chairman
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
so is that case is this system capable
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
now to say show me all the Committees
 
00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
that tier into the Edna committee chair
 
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately not yet that's a field
 
00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:42.299 align:start position:0%
we keep in our spreadsheet so that's one
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
of the issues we haven't been able to
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
break from our spreadsheets and use this
 
00:20:48.049 --> 00:20:48.059 align:start position:0%
technology but now we have this export
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking to add Fields so we don't
 
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
have to keep our separate spreadsheets
 
00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:54.539 align:start position:0%
that is information I can provide to you
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
a list of the chairman in the list of
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
how we have it broken down just so
 
00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:01.559 align:start position:0%
you're aware when a committee is created
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
or a commission is created there'll be
 
00:21:06.289 --> 00:21:06.299 align:start position:0%
an original jurisdiction you know maybe
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
it was a children and family that
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
created the commission but now the
 
00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction may be Judiciary for
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
example so there's an original when you
 
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
get that data from us it it'll have
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
original jurisdiction that's when the
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
legislation was created and then there's
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
now the the now jurisdiction the
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
committee with jurisdiction well what
 
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:31.940 align:start position:0%
we're going to start doing uh soon is
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
calling committee chairs in to this
 
00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:36.419 align:start position:0%
meeting room
 
00:21:36.419 --> 00:21:37.610 align:start position:0%
meeting room
and

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
talk to them about the oversight they
 
00:21:42.649 --> 00:21:42.659 align:start position:0%
have about various committees and and
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
commissions that tear up into their
 
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.789 align:start position:0%
commissions that tear up into their
chairmanship

00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
chairmanship
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
and it will be helpful to know for
 
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:52.090 align:start position:0%
and it will be helpful to know for
example

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:52.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
Mr or Ms committee chair you have 40
 
00:21:59.690 --> 00:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
commissions or committees that tear into
 
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
your community so we can kind of confine
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
the argument a little bit when we're
 
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
talking to them about about the future
 
00:22:08.529 --> 00:22:08.539 align:start position:0%
and so that would be a very helpful uh
 
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
additional capability to this to this
 
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
list yes and I I did anticipate that so
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
I did give a heads up to our our chairs
 
00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:18.860 align:start position:0%
that you may be reaching out
 
00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:21.419 align:start position:0%
right so they should be aware of their
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
commissions some are more experienced
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
than others or aware of their
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
commissions some of them serve on almost
 
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:28.980 align:start position:0%
all of their commissions so
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:33.649 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
so we are still working with it again
 
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
like I said the the top priority for us
 
00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:40.620 align:start position:0%
now is working to clean up that data and
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
then we have some other improvements
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're working on probably a little early
 
00:22:45.169 --> 00:22:45.179 align:start position:0%
to share with you
 
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
um some of the automation plans but but
 
00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
we should be able to share that in the
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
next couple of weeks just for for your
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
information because every Improvement we
 
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
can make as staff not only helps our
 
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
lives and improves our processes but it
 
00:22:59.870 --> 00:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
helps the legislators as well
 
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.169 align:start position:0%
helps the legislators as well
yeah

00:23:02.169 --> 00:23:02.179 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
I think that covers everything for
 
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
master list okay so I'll take on um the
 
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
house continuing ed program
 
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:12.860 align:start position:0%
um that we're going to have on studies
 
00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
so if you all have a draft in front of
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
you uh of a proposal that we it's based
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
on programs we've done in the past and I
 
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
have to share with you having done at
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
least three of these in the last 15
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
years or so they are one of the best
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
attended programs that we have we
 
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
usually do 2 10 to 11 and you can't get
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
into the room so many people come in
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
just for this
 
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
um and as you can see we it's
 
00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
I was going to use names that we used to
 
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:44.690 align:start position:0%
I was going to use names that we used to
you

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
um of participants that I thought I
 
00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
would just make it more General to say
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
staff panel member panel and we cover we
 
00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:54.059 align:start position:0%
have handouts on every single item we
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
have descriptions and definitions and we
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
go into great depth explaining to the
 
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.500 align:start position:0%
membership what all the different types
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
of committees are and then obviously we
 
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
we also emphasize the study committees
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
and commissions
 
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
um and you can see it would you know
 
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
obviously an intro and welcome by a
 
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
facilitator or possibly speaker
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
and then we describe the different
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
vehicles for study as we've referred to
 
00:24:22.669 --> 00:24:22.679 align:start position:0%
them and then go into a description if
 
00:24:24.649 --> 00:24:24.659 align:start position:0%
if the member chooses to create a study
 
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
committee or commission uh sponsor
 
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.669 align:start position:0%
committee or commission uh sponsor
responsibilities

00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
um standing committee process and the
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
first named obligations like for
 
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
instance right now I have a House member
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
who's been after me for four straight
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
days because he is first named to a
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
Senate bill but see we have to do all
 
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
this background work trying to figure
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
out the Senate bill and
 
00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:48.419 align:start position:0%
um this is one of the items that we're
 
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
talking about but I have to educate this
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
member on why it's taking so long
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
um because I can't understand why can't
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
I just call a meeting so um anyway that
 
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
is part of what we would like to explain
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
and then a Roundtable discussion that
 
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
can be the value of what a study is
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
um and how that can help the membership
 
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
and help the process but then examining
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
do do should we have prospective repeal
 
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:15.900 align:start position:0%
dates so it could be um
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
a wonderful opportunity for current
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
members I mean some freshmen to give
 
00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:22.919 align:start position:0%
some perspective but we will
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
um as we go through this process and we
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
get suggestions from the committee on
 
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
how um we think it would it would work
 
00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:32.750 align:start position:0%
how um we think it would it would work
best

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
um then we can just move forward and the
 
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
um I think the membership will really
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
like this program
 
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
um and you can see a staff panel would
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
be similar to our presentation or what
 
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
we did for you back in April
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
and um there may it will be live
 
00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
streamed and on YouTube and there may be
 
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
an afternoon program that has nothing to
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
do with studies there may be this is
 
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299 align:start position:0%
what we've done in the past we've
 
00:25:59.630 --> 00:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
dedicated a full day to house continuing
 
00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
ed and the speaker may choose okay let's
 
00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:03.539 align:start position:0%
have this subject in the morning the
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
subject in the afternoon
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
um we proposed I think I did Wednesday
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
but I think October 12th is a Thursday
 
00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
um we're suggested Thursday October 12th
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
is a possibility because we were hoping
 
00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:18.299 align:start position:0%
that most retained commies would already
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
get going by then and that might be a a
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
good time where the membership could
 
00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
come in and um
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
and participate in this program
 
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
so this is just
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
um a proposal that we want to bring
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
before the committee as you asked us to
 
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
create a continuing ed
 
00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
option and we developed this as I
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned based on previous programs
 
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
so that's it and we have all the
 
00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
material that we need I was going to
 
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
copy it all but I just thought there was
 
00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:48.059 align:start position:0%
more there would just be more
 
00:26:48.059 --> 00:26:49.490 align:start position:0%
more there would just be more
information

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:27:00.649 --> 00:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely
 
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
yeah speaking of mileage the systems
 
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
back up
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
of those of you who were
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
denied the ability to put in mileage
 
00:27:21.289 --> 00:27:21.299 align:start position:0%
over the summer you're you're in
 
00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:23.820 align:start position:0%
September right you can The Summer's
 
00:27:27.289 --> 00:27:27.299 align:start position:0%
over according to our our calendar so uh
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
you can you can go to the kiosk and put
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
okay so that is the date we're planning
 
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
on we ran that past the speaker in
 
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
leadership if you have any concerns with
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
so we have the trifold
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
all right I'll start with uh so the OLS
 
00:27:56.029 --> 00:27:56.039 align:start position:0%
tri-fold pamphlet and
 
00:27:59.930 --> 00:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
I'll first talk about why we decided to
 
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
do the tri-fold pamphlet
 
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
this is basically some so we can educate
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
folks on the on the process of statutory
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
and study committees explain the
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
difference of the two and provide some
 
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
tips some some questions to ask before
 
00:28:18.049 --> 00:28:18.059 align:start position:0%
filing a bill to create a new committee
 
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
or commission and then some suggestions
 
00:28:23.169 --> 00:28:23.179 align:start position:0%
of uh content
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
this this will be in line with our
 
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
continue continuing ed program you know
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
it'll be like supplemental material but
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
it will be a trifold that will include
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
in ORS as well
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
similar along the lines of creating this
 
00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:39.620 align:start position:0%
tri-fold we're also looking at
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
boilerplate language for these
 
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:44.700 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions just to make
 
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
sure they're standardized we've had a
 
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
lot of problems in the past for example
 
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
not having a Sunset date having
 
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:52.140 align:start position:0%
commission names that take up the full
 
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
screen when you come in in the morning
 
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:55.740 align:start position:0%
because they're so long instead of
 
00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:57.140 align:start position:0%
limiting the characters
 
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
just some having consistency like the
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
the first named host member will kick
 
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
off or schedule the organizational
 
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:07.140 align:start position:0%
meeting for a house bill but the first
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
name Senate member would do that for a
 
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
Senate bill
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
we are still working on this we have a
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
draft of the trifold but not yet ready
 
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
to share with you today because it's all
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
departments we're working to make sure
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
all of our pieces are clear and concise
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
and can fit in the tri-fold but we
 
00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
should have that available for your
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
review either end of this week or next
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
and just so you're aware the the speaker
 
00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:33.299 align:start position:0%
plans to meet with the Senate President
 
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:35.580 align:start position:0%
to after we get through all of this
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
initial work just to try to see if we
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
can stay on the same page as at least as
 
00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
much as possible the house and the
 
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
Senate so we have consistency
 
00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
and then I'll turn it over to you and as
 
00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
Sarah mentioned with the trifold our
 
00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
goal is um to list what each office does
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
or is responsible for but as concise as
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
possible because after a while people
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
can't hear what you're sharing but it's
 
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
good for them to know what this is all
 
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
about and give them a backstory but in
 
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
the meantime there is going to be an
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
email going out explaining the process
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
so as we have members gearing up this
 
00:30:12.179 --> 00:30:12.950 align:start position:0%
so as we have members gearing up this
week

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:30:15.289 --> 00:30:15.299 align:start position:0%
to who knows if there are commissions
 
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
looming out there just to explain
 
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
consider this because some of the items
 
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
that has been brought to our attention
 
00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
for instance is
 
00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
um the 45-day
 
00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
um effective date where did that come
 
00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:29.940 align:start position:0%
from why do we have that and and you you
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
remember saying well that's what they
 
00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:33.419 align:start position:0%
gave me but I prefer this okay but that
 
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
that that's a conversation that goes on
 
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
between the drafter and the sponsor
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
nobody else participates but sometimes
 
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:41.220 align:start position:0%
the sponsor doesn't know what questions
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
to ask and the drafters assuming via an
 
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
email that this is what the sponsor
 
00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.870 align:start position:0%
email that this is what the sponsor
wants

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
wants
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and that is problem that we just
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
shared with that Senate bill that I
 
00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
mentioned where the house Members First
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
named a senator cut and paste and sent
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
it to a less and they said oh this is
 
00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:00.299 align:start position:0%
what the senator wants but that isn't
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
at the time that wasn't their goal so
 
00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
anyway there are little things like that
 
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:05.930 align:start position:0%
anyway there are little things like that
and

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
um we just want to get people to think
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
all right so if I'm putting in a study
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
what is it that I want to do what do I
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
want to study as we've talked about
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
before and I won't go over everything
 
00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:18.299 align:start position:0%
we've shared last spring
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
but we're hoping that this trifold
 
00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:22.740 align:start position:0%
that's the goal to get it to the members
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
and so they can refer to that and at
 
00:31:27.889 --> 00:31:27.899 align:start position:0%
least provoke some or make them think
 
00:31:30.409 --> 00:31:30.419 align:start position:0%
about what their end goal is for
 
00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
whatever study they're creating
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
and um as Deborah mentioned we had hoped
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
we we had hoped we had more some
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
something more solid for you today but
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
because of all the different offices
 
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
being involved and and just tweets why
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
give you the best product that we can
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
give you and we figured a few more days
 
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
um would be better than it than a you
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
know basic draft Yeah and yeah and we're
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
open to releasing it in a draft form we
 
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
just want to you know make sure it's as
 
00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
clear as possible and has a helpful
 
00:31:59.630 --> 00:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
content but then releasing it as a draft
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
and getting feedback from those who are
 
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
utilizing it would be helpful and we can
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
make improvements before we we finalize
 
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:06.889 align:start position:0%
make improvements before we we finalize
it

00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
but this is an important part that we we
 
00:32:12.409 --> 00:32:12.419 align:start position:0%
can't emphasize enough the importance of
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
you know and and where we may need your
 
00:32:18.649 --> 00:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
help as far as a boilerplate and it may
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
not just be continuing ed and creating a
 
00:32:24.889 --> 00:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
trifle but possibly including rules
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
changing our house rules or putting
 
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
something in statute to help
 
00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.409 align:start position:0%
something in statute to help
um

00:32:30.409 --> 00:32:30.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
just to help get this consistency I
 
00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:34.620 align:start position:0%
think a lot of people don't understand
 
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
how much churn can be caused when when
 
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.020 align:start position:0%
things are not consistent we did have uh
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
one recently the the charitable gaming
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
commission was created and there were
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
several problems with that that created
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
so much work for staff and legislators
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
up to the Senate President and the
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
speaker and just as one example in that
 
00:32:55.679 --> 00:32:56.510 align:start position:0%
speaker and just as one example in that
um

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:59.930 --> 00:32:59.940 align:start position:0%
commission there were some appointees
 
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
that didn't say who the appointing
 
00:33:04.669 --> 00:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
authority is so for example generally it
 
00:33:06.409 --> 00:33:06.419 align:start position:0%
will say the speaker of the house will
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
appoint two members the Senate President
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
will appoint one member well there were
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
some others listed and it didn't say who
 
00:33:13.549 --> 00:33:13.559 align:start position:0%
the authority was of course we had to
 
00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
have meetings talk about that what are
 
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
we going to do somebody assumed that the
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
house Clerk or the Senate clerk would
 
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
make appointments they don't make
 
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
appointments so what we did was have the
 
00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
Senate President make one of the
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
appointments and the Speaker of the
 
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:26.940 align:start position:0%
House made one of the appointments as
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
well working with the with the leaders
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
but it creates a lot of churn
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
with how some of these are created and
 
00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
if it's not standard and in this
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
particular case it started way back in
 
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
the spring when it when it was initially
 
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
in there and that took some work by the
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee and then that
 
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.970 align:start position:0%
committee and then that
the

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:49.019 align:start position:0%
um people who were representing it was
 
00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:51.059 align:start position:0%
just so it led to a lot of confusion at
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
the time but it did pass and it was
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
vetoed and it was inserted in House Bill
 
00:33:57.889 --> 00:33:57.899 align:start position:0%
2 so now it's no longer it was Senate
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
Bill initially now it's a house bill and
 
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
we have to figure it out and as Deborah
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned it's not just a few people
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
sitting around there were multiple
 
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
meetings on multiple phone calls of
 
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
legal counsel house clerks Senate Clerk
 
00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
and and so that takes a good deal of
 
00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:15.659 align:start position:0%
time and in days and so that's the type
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
of thing that we're trying to avoid and
 
00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
we could have avoided all of this by
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
upon drafting if the sponsor said this
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
this is where I'd like it's my
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
appointing authority and that piece will
 
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
also be in the trifold that you have to
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
think that through I think I may have
 
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:31.740 align:start position:0%
mentioned in our previous meeting set
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
um we used to literally there wouldn't
 
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
be appointing authorities and so say
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
you're a 21-member commission and would
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
just list a teacher from New Hampshire
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
so staff would get together and we'd all
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
between the clerk's office our office
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
and we get phone books out and we'd
 
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
start looking and and trying to find
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
names and people
 
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
um and match them up and calling
 
00:34:54.829 --> 00:34:54.839 align:start position:0%
different associations
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
um so this this is way better than it
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
was but it's still challenging and
 
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
that's why we know when there's no
 
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:03.300 align:start position:0%
appointing authority it can cause
 
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.290 align:start position:0%
appointing authority it can cause
problems

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:05.300 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
well it's nice to hear that you weren't
 
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
calling individual teachers just trying
 
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
to solicit their interests whether it's
 
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
actually associations
 
00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
um I think it's the you know it's
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
efficiency and effectiveness of of
 
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
everyone who works here that we need to
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
be looking out for and so uh I think
 
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
this makes a ton of sense and I think we
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
should be creative right outside of the
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
continuing education outside of an email
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
to the Eunice membership
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
um let's make sure that we're continuing
 
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
to reiterate how important this is also
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
smart not to roll all this out right
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
before osr filing otherwise we might
 
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
have seen double the number of study
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions that I think
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
we're I think we're on the right track
 
00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
and thanks thanks for the work that you
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
put into thank you to getting this
 
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
together because it's not about it's not
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
about oh well it stinks that you know
 
00:35:51.359 --> 00:35:52.190 align:start position:0%
about oh well it stinks that you know
they

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
y'all are you know
 
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
you know the president need to get
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
together and work on this it's not
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
that's not the issue it's the issues
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
you've got other things on your plate uh
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
and we need to make sure that everyone's
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
spending their time in the smartest way
 
00:36:03.599 --> 00:36:04.550 align:start position:0%
spending their time in the smartest way
possible

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
right one of the things we had mentioned
 
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
last spring was that we're going to work
 
00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:14.099 align:start position:0%
with elaconis and his crew about putting
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
together a legislative template
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
is that integrated with a trifold is
 
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
that is that where the trifold takes us
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
that it has evolved somewhat into the
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
tri-fold and we still are working on the
 
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
template but there's they they have to
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
look at their own system see how it can
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
work so it may
 
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
I think it might um possibly we can come
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
up with a plan for maybe the following
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
um filing term but it won't be ready for
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
this for this week but the trifold it
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
seems to me that that would be readily
 
00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
fixable if we put it in the template
 
00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.310 align:start position:0%
fixable if we put it in the template
that

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
you have to have this you have to
 
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
um look for a sponsor or whatever or you
 
00:36:58.730 --> 00:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
know uh that that's part of the things
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
to check off on the template that you
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
know have you done this and if you
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
haven't then
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
we'll get let's see if we can get OLS to
 
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
kick it back so you haven't followed the
 
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.270 align:start position:0%
kick it back so you haven't followed the
template

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
template
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
well representative I think it's one of
 
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
the options you're absolutely right that
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
that that's but I think we're looking at
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
all those options and what best could
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
work with the OLS system
 
00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:19.859 align:start position:0%
so um so I mean it's still on on the
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
table so uh I I don't mean to get get
 
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
ahead of your briefing but will we uh be
 
00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:29.579 align:start position:0%
able to hear from OLS soon about how
 
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
they're work how they're doing with that
 
00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
template that we asked for
 
00:37:37.069 --> 00:37:37.079 align:start position:0%
so so the initial plan is to get this
 
00:37:39.050 --> 00:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
the tri-fold out there because that will
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
have a checklist of you know some of the
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
concerns we've had in the past and what
 
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
could be included in it then I think the
 
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:46.140 align:start position:0%
template would be the next step that the
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
template is where we really need your
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
help as legislators because even OLS
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's hard to to push back when a
 
00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:54.980 align:start position:0%
legislator wants to submit legislation
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
they can only push back so much so
 
00:37:59.690 --> 00:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
having this tri-fold approved by
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
legislators will be have you looked into
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
these things first and here are some
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
things you should include in your in
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
your do do you think we need to have a
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
working session with OLS to mature the
 
00:38:12.839 --> 00:38:14.450 align:start position:0%
working session with OLS to mature the
template

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
template
 
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
entered this week so so this week or
 
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
next we'll have the tri-fold ready for
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
you and we'd like to roll that out as a
 
00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
draft as soon as possible for all
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
legislators and then I think that you
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
know seeing how that goes and what may
 
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
change in in that will help drive out
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
the the template but then the template I
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
think we it would be a collaborative
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
effort it's you know I think OLS is
 
00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
challenged with they could create a
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
template but if a legislator chooses not
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
to use it then there's not much
 
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
obviously we won't have the template
 
00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
ready for the legislative or work to be
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
done this week right so yeah and and
 
00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
one one thing I want to mention too is
 
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
remember that the majority of the
 
00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees come later in
 
00:39:00.589 --> 00:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
the year though some are initially
 
00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
requested during this filing period
 
00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
it'll be a few compared to the number
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
that come later you know lots of times
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a bill and it's not
 
00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:11.089 align:start position:0%
you're looking at a bill and it's not
necessarily

00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:11.810 align:start position:0%
necessarily
um

00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:14.329 --> 00:39:14.339 align:start position:0%
maybe it needs more work so it turns
 
00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:16.619 align:start position:0%
into a study committee or which is fine
 
00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
or a statutory commission so you know if
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
we can get that tri-fold up and running
 
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
it in good shape and you know get
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
feedback and input into that maybe we
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
can look to get the template so what do
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
you need from us for the trifold just to
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
review it yes certainly yeah certainly
 
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
and when you guys give kind of a stamp
 
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
of approval on the draft we could we
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
could share it with the rest of the
 
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
legislators and then you know test it
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
out and you have a feel when it will be
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
ready for us to review either this week
 
00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
right it might it might be I would think
 
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
next only because we want all of us to
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
participate and this isn't a good week
 
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:54.980 align:start position:0%
to ask them for participation
 
00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:57.180 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to meet again in
 
00:39:59.930 --> 00:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:02.579 align:start position:0%
Yeah man so
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
you brought up you know statute and
 
00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
rules is another way to address some of
 
00:40:10.849 --> 00:40:10.859 align:start position:0%
these the consistency in the the
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
standards here and I wonder
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
I think we should just all be thinking
 
00:40:17.089 --> 00:40:17.099 align:start position:0%
about that because
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's this year or it's next year
 
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
or in the future
 
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:22.609 align:start position:0%
or in the future
um

00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
you know there's nothing that keeps a
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
legislator from looking at the tri-fold
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
brochure and saying well I don't want to
 
00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
do it that way
 
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
and but if we put something into rules
 
00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:34.619 align:start position:0%
or into statute then it would then it
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
would require everyone to use that
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
template so get an administrative rules
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
they have to follow it yeah I mean or
 
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
put into house yeah we're proposing that
 
00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
um for you we're going to Paul is
 
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
working on he wants a list of what we
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
may want for rules and then we'll also
 
00:40:53.329 --> 00:40:53.339 align:start position:0%
have them for RSA 1449 for and then as
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
you remember position the the
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
um vehicle in in Legend that's sitting
 
00:40:59.810 --> 00:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
there for us
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
um or for the committee to um
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
because the student retained Bill's
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
status that may be amended with this
 
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
information so we are looking that we
 
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
have a we have a list that we're
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
maintaining to uh share with you at a
 
00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:17.099 align:start position:0%
future meeting of possibilities and one
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
of them as Deborah mentioned the lengthy
 
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
titles that just doesn't help anybody
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
um we have other
 
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
items that you may not all be aware of
 
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
for instance and we came across this one
 
00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:31.849 align:start position:0%
for instance and we came across this one
um

00:41:31.849 --> 00:41:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
it if you go to our docket the docket
 
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
will say uh that this committee hasn't
 
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:40.140 align:start position:0%
met in possibly two or four years they
 
00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:42.180 align:start position:0%
actually have been meeting every month
 
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
but they have an outside entity because
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's 21 members but only two legislators
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
so they they have a life of their own
 
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
and in that uh we we found their web
 
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
page and in that it has a little um it
 
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
says legislatively approved they have a
 
00:41:59.089 --> 00:41:59.099 align:start position:0%
little seal that they created that but
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
they never send the information they
 
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
don't reach out to the members once
 
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
they're appointed they do not
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
um send their information to the house
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
or the Senate Clerk's offices
 
00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
so for our purposes we believe they're
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
not meeting and then turns out yes they
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
certainly are meeting off-site and have
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
been meeting
 
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:17.099 align:start position:0%
um and we stumbled upon that because
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
someone remembered that there was a
 
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
presentation and then we researchers
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
went online and we found it we said
 
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
they've been meeting right along and
 
00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.670 align:start position:0%
they've been meeting right along and
but

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:30.950 align:start position:0%
but
no

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:32.339 align:start position:0%
they do follow reports but they don't
 
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
have to send them to us or they may or
 
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
they may be such a commission that
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to report there is such a
 
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
thing and they just
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
they they just do yeah what they need to
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
do I'm actually glad you mentioned that
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
so you know the export when you export
 
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
data from the statutory and study
 
00:42:50.329 --> 00:42:50.339 align:start position:0%
committee page so if you're looking at
 
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
that last meeting held and you see 2008
 
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
that may be old data
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
it may be old data because the house and
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
the Senate generally update the the back
 
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
end where that data is they update it
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
when somebody tells them to they're not
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
looking at these 200 commissions and and
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
keeping it up to date it's somebody will
 
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
send them an appointment notice okay
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
these are the house members and they'll
 
00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:15.420 align:start position:0%
update or this is when the last meeting
 
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
was held and they'll update that so just
 
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind if you know because I
 
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
could imagine you'd see that column and
 
00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
say oh let's search to see when they
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
haven't met that that's not 100 accurate
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
we are trying to uh
 
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
share information with you when we know
 
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
that there's a committee that could
 
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
potentially be repealed so
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
we'll take that with a grain of salt
 
00:43:38.329 --> 00:43:38.339 align:start position:0%
sorry I know Ian wanted to speak to why
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
don't you go ahead no you go ahead sure
 
00:43:44.329 --> 00:43:44.339 align:start position:0%
okay I was going to ask is there any
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
reason why even if a committee is
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
meeting or a commission is meeting under
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
an executive department uh with only a
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
couple legislative appointees or any
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
reason why they shouldn't be filing
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
reports with
 
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate clerks no only if
 
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's in the legislation that created
 
00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:04.849 align:start position:0%
it's in the legislation that created
them

00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
that's where it sits
 
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
um as I share with you we created that
 
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
boilerplate language in 95 to make sure
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
that the reports were submitted
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
specifically to Senate President the
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
speaker the governor and the State
 
00:44:18.119 --> 00:44:19.910 align:start position:0%
speaker the governor and the State
Library

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
Library
 
00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.450 align:start position:0%
Library
um

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
but this this one or they may they may
 
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:25.980 align:start position:0%
they could possibly submit it and only
 
00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
submit it to the governor they may not
 
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
see the need because stuff get those the
 
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
chairmanships of these groups changes
 
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
over and then something they just
 
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
appoint people they don't even realize
 
00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:38.339 align:start position:0%
they didn't even think about
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
the originating legislation that created
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
them so they may just say well this is
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
how our group functions now and
 
00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:47.339 align:start position:0%
and then you have new membership that
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
they just reappoint and it never comes
 
00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:52.260 align:start position:0%
back here okay so that is something that
 
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
we could consider down the line as you
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
know standardizing the way the reporting
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
process works yeah to make sure that all
 
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
reports for all committees and
 
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
commissions are filed with the Senate
 
00:45:05.329 --> 00:45:05.339 align:start position:0%
President because that's what we did in
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
95 as I mentioned so that language sits
 
00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
there but there are still some groups
 
00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
who won't do it got it okay and that's
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
and that's what we try but this is what
 
00:45:14.569 --> 00:45:14.579 align:start position:0%
we're finding out and that's what we're
 
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
saying it's taking such a long time that
 
00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
we're coming we're coming upon these
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
items as we're searching
 
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
and so many of these they're volunteer
 
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
driven right I mean it's so it's people
 
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
are just sort of taking
 
00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
first of all it probably took them a lot
 
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
like with State reps who you sometimes
 
00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
beg to run for office takes takes a lot
 
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
to get them to say yes and then once
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
they say yes they're getting
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
certain amount of information from
 
00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
certain people not necessarily reviewing
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
the statute that that created their
 
00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:44.099 align:start position:0%
entity to begin with
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
so I was I was thinking uh along the
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
line with Matt
 
00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:51.180 align:start position:0%
put that little tick mark on the
 
00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.730 align:start position:0%
put that little tick mark on the
checklist

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know because this is you know this
 
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
is why we're reviewing this check
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
checklist for things exactly like this I
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
bet it's on there in your binder
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
um there's there's a section that gives
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
the history of how we um came up with
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
the different the different years when
 
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
we created boilerplate language but we
 
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
can it's all just in a narrative we
 
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
could pull it out and create a chart
 
00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:23.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
just to add
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
different different commissions may have
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
different reporting requirements though
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
often times they have they're due around
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
the same time November 1st December 1st
 
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
whatever that may be there's nothing
 
00:46:38.569 --> 00:46:38.579 align:start position:0%
holding these people accountable to make
 
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
sure they do their reports even if it's
 
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:41.700 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
and then also the reports since they're
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
all due around the same time the Senate
 
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
President speaker Governor is receiving
 
00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
these reports all at once and so if
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
they're not you know
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
getting anything else saying hey I'd
 
00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
like to meet with you to review the
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
report it's just a stack of reports and
 
00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:02.780 align:start position:0%
of course they can't review all of these
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
reports at one time so that that I do
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
find is another issue hopefully that
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
different commissions are taking them
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
and and running with them and doing what
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
they need to do but it's rare from my
 
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
perspective working with the speaker
 
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:20.220 align:start position:0%
it's rare when somebody says oh I'd like
 
00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:22.380 align:start position:0%
some time with the speaker to review
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
this report
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
we put so much time and effort into
 
00:47:29.809 --> 00:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
these commissions and committees that
 
00:47:31.609 --> 00:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
and some of these reports look beautiful
 
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of data they've put in so
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
much work so I just would like to know
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
what's happening after with some of them
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
and we and as um Deborah mentioned
 
00:47:44.809 --> 00:47:44.819 align:start position:0%
we we don't know if the reports come in
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
in some cases we obviously will get them
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
to the um standing committee chairs but
 
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
we file them and some people will just
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
the commission may never have met
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
um if you
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
they couldn't get a quorum and so they
 
00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
never met and their their family report
 
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
will just be a letter to the speakers
 
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
and president and Governor saying that
 
00:48:08.089 --> 00:48:08.099 align:start position:0%
we could never make a quorum so this is
 
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
our report
 
00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
just this letter and it's unfortunate
 
00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.849 align:start position:0%
just this letter and it's unfortunate
but

00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
um that's part of this process
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
um that's why as we've mentioned before
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
we put a lot of energy into
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
supporting Administration disappointing
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
these commissions administratively at
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
least at the front end and whereas if
 
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
it's a chaptered study or even the
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
commission you can stay you can study
 
00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
that issue but you don't have the the
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
um dedicate staff time to create to
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
track down the people or to get it all
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
set up or find a meeting place or
 
00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
whatever it may take to make that happen
 
00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
and then you if you don't make quarma we
 
00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
have had lots of members
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
stuck in that waiting and you're waiting
 
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
for different groups to appoint and if
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
they don't appoint you you can't
 
00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
so it's just one more roadblock let me
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
ask you a rules question if
 
00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.970 align:start position:0%
ask you a rules question if
if a

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
if a
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
committee fails to meet Forum
 
00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.990 align:start position:0%
committee fails to meet Forum
consistently

00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
and that is is uh appears to be
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
justification to eliminate that
 
00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
committee because it never meets quorum
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
is that something that has to be
 
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
accomplished with legislation to
 
00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
eliminate that committee or can there be
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
a rule that says if Quorum is not met
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know in six consecutive tries that
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
the committee is decommissioned well I
 
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
would double check with Paul with the
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
clerk and house counsel but I I would
 
00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
think that it would have to be
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislation because it's law that
 
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
created the commission
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
and it's law I think you'd have to have
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
a repeal date but in many of these
 
00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.050 align:start position:0%
a repeal date but in many of these
instances

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
instances
 
00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:51.829 align:start position:0%
instances
um

00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
they do are automatically have a
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
reporting deadline or appeal date and
 
00:49:58.849 --> 00:49:58.859 align:start position:0%
that's what's unfortunate is that they
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
get to that deadline and you haven't
 
00:50:01.849 --> 00:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
been able to meet
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
because they didn't have one and then
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
it's automatically repealed or yes or
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
ended when it hits that date exactly you
 
00:50:10.849 --> 00:50:10.859 align:start position:0%
don't need legislation for that yeah
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
because it's already built into
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
legislation it's part of the boilerplate
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
language okay for the for our
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
committee's edification
 
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
when speaking with a speaker uh in June
 
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that he's going to
 
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
allow us to do is recognize that our
 
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
legislative window closes
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
this week
 
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
so the question is what do we do about
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that might need to be filed
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
to eliminate some of these committees
 
00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:44.339 align:start position:0%
uh these commissions and the the thought
 
00:50:47.569 --> 00:50:47.579 align:start position:0%
is that he shared with uh what John and
 
00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:48.980 align:start position:0%
I was that
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
you come to the rules committee
 
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
and you ask for a special legislative
 
00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
window to be opened to allow some of
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
this activity to take place and uh
 
00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
in their in the kindness of their hearts
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
they're likely to approve that the rules
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
can be so that that would be the plan of
 
00:51:10.309 --> 00:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
attack we don't need to say at the end
 
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
of this week
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
we don't have the legislator ready to go
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislation ready to go
 
00:51:19.569 --> 00:51:19.579 align:start position:0%
you know we're done until next spring no
 
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
there isn't another available
 
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
opportunity with this with the speakers
 
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.690 align:start position:0%
opportunity with this with the speakers
uh

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.190 align:start position:0%
uh
cooperation

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
cooperation
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
to sponsor through the through the rules
 
00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:31.190 align:start position:0%
to sponsor through the through the rules
committee

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
and I think there's some special window
 
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
in your committee doing allegi admin too
 
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure I completely
 
00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.270 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure I completely
understand

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
to retained a bill so we have you know
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
through October to
 
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
work on that as well okay and and they
 
00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
can move forward Anthony
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and they can move it forward and by
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:03.180 align:start position:0%
and before we move to the last item I
 
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
just wanted to you would ask the
 
00:52:06.049 --> 00:52:06.059 align:start position:0%
question about reaching a quorum and I
 
00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:07.619 align:start position:0%
know that's extremely frustrating we've
 
00:52:08.809 --> 00:52:08.819 align:start position:0%
had a couple
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
um recently too where the the chair will
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
put in a lot of effort to schedule the
 
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
meeting they'll work in advance for to
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
make sure they have a quorum and then a
 
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
quorum doesn't show up but in my
 
00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:20.339 align:start position:0%
experience working with the speaker if
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
it happens multiple times it's generally
 
00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
somebody from the commission will reach
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
out to me and say hey your house member
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
isn't showing up we need a new appointee
 
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
so that's another option as well you
 
00:52:31.490 --> 00:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
know you know maybe that house member
 
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
didn't have interest in the commission
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't have time anymore but
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
we can get another appointee out to try
 
00:52:39.609 --> 00:52:39.619 align:start position:0%
to make sure a quorum is reached
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
administratively I think our video timed
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
out do you need to do anything to
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
this no this was just for the uh the
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
quick little demo of the export yeah
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
and so the the last uh section here we
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
want to talk about is go over committees
 
00:52:58.569 --> 00:52:58.579 align:start position:0%
that could potentially be reviewed for
 
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's hot it is it is warm in here
 
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
we added to this list we gave you five
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
back in um in May
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
um and then we've been obviously you've
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
seen the updates down in the far right
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
hand corner and we've added a few more
 
00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:38.700 align:start position:0%
so we're up to nine and
 
00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
um Deborah thinks we're gonna have a few
 
00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
more maybe another two or three but we
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
looked through
 
00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
um these were the unique
 
00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:47.870 align:start position:0%
um these were the unique
um

00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:50.089 --> 00:53:50.099 align:start position:0%
commissions that
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
um we know that you want to see uh
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
what was out there that hadn't been
 
00:53:58.309 --> 00:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
meeting that needed to meet and so we
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
did was we took the leftover list from
 
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative Evil's committee and
 
00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
updated that and then we went through
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
other items that we were aware of and
 
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see see us committee's citation
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
the year was created
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
the appointees the government agency and
 
00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
then the notes as to why
 
00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:17.329 align:start position:0%
then the notes as to why
um

00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
they may not have met or that they may
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
have met
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
um and it explains
 
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.309 align:start position:0%
um and it explains
um

00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
why these items are still in existence
 
00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
so these this list May Encompass
 
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
um members that you want to ask uh to
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
come in before you and ask them what
 
00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
their plans are because this is
 
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
um what you had been reviewing
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
we were hoping the list would be a
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
little bit longer but this is at least a
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
starting point as we get more we'll
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
share them with you we also met with the
 
00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
Senate this morning and asked if they
 
00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
could do a similar activity if there are
 
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
any that they're aware that could
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
potentially be repealed or looked at at
 
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
least and then just also keep in mind we
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
have study committees that will be
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
self-repealing this year and next year
 
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
too so there are some numbers that you
 
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
don't need to file legislation on that
 
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
will repeal
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I was just thinking of the
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
numbers if let's say we have a couple of
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
dozen committee chairs if we say bring
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
us one
 
00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:26.579 align:start position:0%
from your committee
 
00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:31.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.049 --> 00:55:36.059 align:start position:0%
so uh I think we think it's doable to
 
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
start getting some momentum on this and
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
I I can tell you
 
00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
uh having
 
00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
firsthand observation of some of the
 
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:46.740 align:start position:0%
Committees of conference that we went
 
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
through in June
 
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
I know that uh
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
one of the ones on Edna the Senate
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:55:57.599 --> 00:55:58.730 align:start position:0%
wanted to
create

00:55:58.730 --> 00:55:58.740 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:02.099 align:start position:0%
a you know a commission and all the
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
members of the House part of the
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
committee conference Democrats and
 
00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
Republicans said no way we got enough no
 
00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:11.900 align:start position:0%
more in that Community Conference died
 
00:56:14.809 --> 00:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
and they would the committee was not
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
created so that's
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
I don't claim that as a victory but it's
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
it's one less than we would have had if
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
it had been
 
00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
agreed to create another
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
so so that I take that as a small
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
snippet of information that committee
 
00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:36.420 align:start position:0%
chairs are getting the word that we have
 
00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
too many
 
00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
too many committees and too many
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
commissions and they're ready to
 
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:43.500 align:start position:0%
you know turn the speaker off so to
 
00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
speak and that was a good example of
 
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:56:50.049 --> 00:56:50.059 align:start position:0%
maybe we can build on that
 
00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
I'll get into this in a little while as
 
00:56:56.809 --> 00:56:56.819 align:start position:0%
we brief the speaker uh and we were
 
00:56:58.609 --> 00:56:58.619 align:start position:0%
John and I were kind of claiming victory
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
that we were getting the right frame of
 
00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
mind and the template and the trifold
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
was all coming together and one of the
 
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
things that somebody in speaker staff
 
00:57:12.890 --> 00:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
said I forget who it was and
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
that's that's good but do you realize
 
00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
we've had
 
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
two dozen more commissions created since
 
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
since you guys started up so we'll
 
00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
the feedback was kind of we're losing
 
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
ground uh and we need to be probably a
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
little bit more aggressive going forward
 
00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
and I agree with you that education and
 
00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
awareness will will you know helping to
 
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:36.780 align:start position:0%
spread the word will get people thinking
 
00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
of other ways to do this and when we do
 
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
the the tri-fold and the continuing add
 
00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
to reminding folks that you don't have
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
to create a statutory commission to to
 
00:57:48.049 --> 00:57:48.059 align:start position:0%
meet on a subject you know study
 
00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
committees are great but you can also
 
00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
pop and any chair can create a
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee you can you can meet on
 
00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
these things without creating
 
00:57:58.849 --> 00:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
legislation for them and and that's the
 
00:58:01.549 --> 00:58:01.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee route can take a lot of the
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
starch out of this uh this is this is
 
00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:05.630 align:start position:0%
starch out of this uh this is this is
issue

00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
um and then we also have the chaptered
 
00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:10.140 align:start position:0%
studies which are members only but we
 
00:58:12.049 --> 00:58:12.059 align:start position:0%
have told a lot of our members which is
 
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
what we used to it we have shared with
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
you commissions used to be rare what we
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
did was we had the chaptered studies of
 
00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:19.500 align:start position:0%
house senate members and then you'd
 
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
invite you you literally could invite
 
00:58:23.329 --> 00:58:23.339 align:start position:0%
the people to sit at the table and talk
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
but then
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
um it just evolved to create the
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
commissions and then they wanted these
 
00:58:32.089 --> 00:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
other entities to be voting members and
 
00:58:34.549 --> 00:58:34.559 align:start position:0%
that's how it came about
 
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
this really wouldn't apply in front
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
another year or so but when we brief
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
it goes through orientation for new uh
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
new house members I think one of the
 
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.530 align:start position:0%
new house members I think one of the
issues

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:49.910 align:start position:0%
issues
that

00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:53.640 align:start position:0%
new house members deal with is they they
 
00:58:55.370 --> 00:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
come they're all excited about their
 
00:58:57.289 --> 00:58:57.299 align:start position:0%
campaign and they they have a victory
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
and then they they say I'm gonna go and
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
save world hunger and they they show up
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
and they they have members of the public
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
who elicited
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
commitments from them say I'm going to
 
00:59:15.289 --> 00:59:15.299 align:start position:0%
go do such and such for you and what
 
00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:20.460 align:start position:0%
that does in many cases is filing
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
a request for a committee to study it
 
00:59:25.609 --> 00:59:25.619 align:start position:0%
well we know I don't know really what to
 
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
do with this issue but we'll study it
 
00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:29.180 align:start position:0%
for a few years
 
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
and that's I think what gets us into
 
00:59:34.250 --> 00:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
trouble in many cases is we don't really
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
know about all these commitments to go
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
study something that we're really dead
 
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
in some cases doesn't really have the
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
the interest that much of the of that
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
new representative but the
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative has made a commitment to
 
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
a constituent that they're going to go
 
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
study something and and then
 
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
the rest of us are left with how to
 
00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:56.700 align:start position:0%
staff that and is it really worth
 
00:59:58.970 --> 00:59:58.980 align:start position:0%
studying and
 
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
so that's something I think we can help
 
01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.049 align:start position:0%
so that's something I think we can help
educate

01:00:03.049 --> 01:00:03.059 align:start position:0%
educate
 
01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:05.640 align:start position:0%
our new house members to be very careful
 
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
about making commitments the
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
constituency you're going to go study
 
01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
a majority of of house members that
 
01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:20.339 align:start position:0%
really want to go do that and and this
 
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
is to just satisfy a constituent by
 
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
you might really be driving the cost of
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
government and
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
and driving you know all of us to go do
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
things that may not be necessary and
 
01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
rips and Dolan that that's you're
 
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
exactly right in that that's part of the
 
01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
piece with the trifold we have a series
 
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:43.260 align:start position:0%
of questions we're hoping that we might
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
incorporate that we developed as well
 
01:00:47.329 --> 01:00:47.339 align:start position:0%
and it's those questions
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
um and we've shared with you before have
 
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:51.780 align:start position:0%
you done research did you check with OLS
 
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
research is it was a study before and
 
01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
just make sure that that sponsor checks
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
off all those lists and say oh well I
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that a commission already
 
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:04.140 align:start position:0%
exists on this or that the agency could
 
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
easily help
 
01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
um resolve a situation
 
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
so you're exactly right if we can
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
obviously we're looking at
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
um attack news from all ends from
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
continuing ed from the tri-fold from
 
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
staff and
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know I I keep thinking this is this
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
is the last chance to fix this thing and
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
we're all we're almost there at least
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
well thank you so much for all this
 
01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
additional work that you've done over
 
01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
the summer it's been very helpful you're
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
welcome I'm really uh looking forward to
 
01:01:41.089 --> 01:01:41.099 align:start position:0%
that what that trifold looks like and
 
01:01:41.099 --> 01:01:43.030 align:start position:0%
that what that trifold looks like and
and

01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:01:45.049 --> 01:01:45.059 align:start position:0%
providing feedback
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
so we can move out with it
 
01:01:50.329 --> 01:01:50.339 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any comments for staff
 
01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:51.230 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any comments for staff
right

01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:55.400 align:start position:0%
yeah John well I'm I'm happy
 
01:01:59.210 --> 01:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
that there will be guidance
 
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
because up to now
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
there really hasn't been any formal
 
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
guidance for new members
 
01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
to do this and I know when I came in you
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
know you look around and you go what I
 
01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
don't how do I do this stuff and when
 
01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:19.980 align:start position:0%
you have even at the at the at the
 
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
introduction meetings there was no
 
01:02:25.089 --> 01:02:25.099 align:start position:0%
guidance on how to do this
 
01:02:30.049 --> 01:02:30.059 align:start position:0%
and any guidance that we provide will be
 
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
get so much payback it's ridiculous
 
01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.589 align:start position:0%
get so much payback it's ridiculous
because

01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
I think you will I mean I've had new
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
members you've had new members come to
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
you go how do we do this
 
01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:44.940 align:start position:0%
and you're going
 
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
wait a minute I never had training on it
 
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.410 align:start position:0%
wait a minute I never had training on it
either

01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
well I was the chair of Museum and
 
01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
County a couple years ago
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
and yeah I didn't I can tell you I
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
didn't have a Clues how many committees
 
01:03:02.089 --> 01:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
or commissions
 
01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
I should have been overseeing or looking
 
01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
into or or helping decide what what
 
01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:09.349 align:start position:0%
into or or helping decide what what
their

01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
workload ought to be or what their focus
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
ought to be and I I would say that I
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
don't think I I'm an isolated was an
 
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
isolated chair I think a lot of Cheers
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
are in that role and you ask them how
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
many how many committees or commissions
 
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
you fall into tear into you as a
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
committee chair I think most of them are
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
going to shrug their shoulders and say I
 
01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
have no idea and I think educating them
 
01:03:37.609 --> 01:03:37.619 align:start position:0%
along those lines is a big first step
 
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
exactly just giving this visibility we
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
had some shares who said
 
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
appoint me to all of my commissions that
 
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
the policy committee has jurisdiction
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
over just so they can get to know them
 
01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:49.380 align:start position:0%
and understand is it really needed can
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
they be Consolidated or repealed so yeah
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
has been helpful yeah this is a this is
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
a Quantum Leap
 
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
of what from what we had so I think a
 
01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
lot of members are going to really
 
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
appreciate it and then
 
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
like we we have some knowledge about it
 
01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
you know some things winner we may not
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
even have realized and then we have when
 
01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
we have new members coming in we can
 
01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
mentor them
 
01:04:18.490 --> 01:04:18.500 align:start position:0%
and say here if this is the checklist
 
01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
that we've can come up with and that
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
we're using oh it's really nice better
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
than you know this that we've had in the
 
01:04:28.559 --> 01:04:29.750 align:start position:0%
than you know this that we've had in the
past

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:04:33.049 --> 01:04:33.059 align:start position:0%
so I'm all for it and so so what what's
 
01:04:36.049 --> 01:04:36.059 align:start position:0%
the the opportunity let's look at what
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
what do we expect
 
01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:44.700 align:start position:0%
in the next election
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
of 2024.
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
what do we think we're going to get for
 
01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
for rookie legislators
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
but what's typical the 50 or 60 a third
 
01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
about a third
 
01:05:00.710 --> 01:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
so so that that is the opportunity I
 
01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:01.670 align:start position:0%
so so that that is the opportunity I
think

01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
to uh to really educate them as to how
 
01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:10.140 align:start position:0%
well one of the items during orientation
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
they have so much to learn during those
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
first two and a half days traditionally
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
years ago we used to have a the
 
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
continuing ad component would follow up
 
01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
right after that and we could
 
01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
parliamentary procedure and this was one
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
of the items that we would do but as we
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
all know
 
01:05:29.089 --> 01:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
covid changed a lot of our practices and
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
and we're just um embracing everything
 
01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
again so relate to this but certainly in
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
whoever the new leadership would be in
 
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
January 2025
 
01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:41.579 align:start position:0%
this would be something they could look
 
01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:44.579 align:start position:0%
at because you do it is so much
 
01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:46.619 align:start position:0%
information and members need to to get
 
01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
there to understand exactly how this
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
process runs and then understands
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
understand what the studies are
 
01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.650 align:start position:0%
understand what the studies are
right

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
hope it also gave us the opportunity to
 
01:05:59.569 --> 01:05:59.579 align:start position:0%
Fast Track technology here though is
 
01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
true as well as you know so yes we're
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
trying to take advantage of that too
 
01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
so hopefully what we've given you is is
 
01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:09.710 align:start position:0%
so hopefully what we've given you is is
helpful

01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
um you know we've got the export so you
 
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
have a list of the Committees and
 
01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:14.270 align:start position:0%
have a list of the Committees and
commissions

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
and continuing ed I believe the the
 
01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
continuing ed date is a month from
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is that correct so we'll be
 
01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
working through that program and and
 
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
send that to you for your review and in
 
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
case you want to provide input on that
 
01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
the OLS trifold as we've mentioned we
 
01:06:31.849 --> 01:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
should have that draft ready for your
 
01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
review in a week or two when you guys
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
give that kind of a stamp we can send it
 
01:06:38.089 --> 01:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
out to the rest of legislators so we can
 
01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:39.559 align:start position:0%
start to put that into practice
 
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
eleanor-wise I'm going to schedule
 
01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
another meeting at two weeks
 
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
from from today so you can think about
 
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh at that meeting anything you might
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
want to present to us or that might be
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.569 --> 01:06:59.579 align:start position:0%
and then we've given you a list of some
 
01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
committees that you can review for
 
01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
potential repeal
 
01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:05.339 align:start position:0%
and we'll as we get more we'll we'll
 
01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
just share them with you right
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
so representative Dolan so you're
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
looking at September 25th yes at one yes
 
01:07:12.839 --> 01:07:16.849 align:start position:0%
looking at September 25th yes at one yes
okay

01:07:16.849 --> 01:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
as we think about uh uh scheduling
 
01:07:23.809 --> 01:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
committee chairs coming to to talk with
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
us about the Committees and commissions
 
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
that are under their jurisdiction I
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
wonder if we can also invite uh ranking
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
members as well who may provide a
 
01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
slightly different perspective on the
 
01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
importance of certain issues
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
um I think it'll make sure that we
 
01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:40.859 align:start position:0%
continue to operate in a really
 
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
bipartisan way I agree very good idea it
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
also generally the ones who serve on
 
01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:47.339 align:start position:0%
them as well too
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
many leadership how do we call it that
 
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
committee leadership do we want uh
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
chairs Vice chairs and ranking members
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
or just chairs and ranking members you
 
01:07:57.119 --> 01:07:58.430 align:start position:0%
or just chairs and ranking members you
think

01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:08:00.589 --> 01:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
I think either way I mean I'd be good
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
for them to let everyone know I know on
 
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
the Democratic side we've got you know
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
ranking members and Deputy ranking
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
members so I think you have I think I
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
think it's important for the chairs and
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
the ranking members to be there and then
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
if they want to let other members their
 
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
committee know that we're gonna have
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
this conversations obviously open to the
 
01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.829 align:start position:0%
this conversations obviously open to the
public

01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
one of the Hallmarks of this committee
 
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
thus far is that we've had no uh
 
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
party interference or or uh or or
 
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
issues like I think we're all on the
 
01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
same page just this is something that
 
01:08:33.789 --> 01:08:33.799 align:start position:0%
needs to be done
 
01:08:36.169 --> 01:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
regardless of the content this is more
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
of a process and procedure change that
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you guys very much
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
um just
 
01:08:50.209 --> 01:08:50.219 align:start position:0%
we want for the items for the next
 
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
meeting and so we will have that for you
 
01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
and okay
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes tri-fold
 
01:08:59.090 --> 01:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
that's probably the biggest thing and
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
and we started looking at that and the
 
01:09:02.809 --> 01:09:02.819 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet if we can see if we can get
 
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
it to help us do a sort on the
 
01:09:08.209 --> 01:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet so that we could say tell me
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
how this all tears into the education
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee chair whatever
 
01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure if that that field
 
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
will be available yet but I had I had
 
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
promised um all chairs that I would send
 
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:21.660 align:start position:0%
them a list of their commissions and
 
01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
committees so what I could do is I could
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
put you on the CC of each of those
 
01:09:28.249 --> 01:09:28.259 align:start position:0%
emails if that's yeah that's cool okay
 
01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:30.660 align:start position:0%

01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
okay and hopefully yeah that's my plan
 
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll be deeper closer to the win
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%

discussion we're going to have but um
 
01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
I think we can let you guys go now thank
 
01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:36.669 align:start position:0%
I think we can let you guys go now thank
you

01:10:36.669 --> 01:10:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
actually we're not closed on Columbus
 
01:10:39.719 --> 01:10:43.070 align:start position:0%
actually we're not closed on Columbus
State

01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll still have a discussion about
 
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
it because I'm not
 
01:10:48.169 --> 01:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how everybody feels about
 
01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
meeting on Columbus Day especially with
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
those those of us who have children that
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
will be home from school that need our
 
01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.350 align:start position:0%
will be home from school that need our
attention

01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
attention
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
I think we need to stay sensitive to
 
01:10:59.159 --> 01:11:00.770 align:start position:0%
I think we need to stay sensitive to
that

01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't want people having to
 
01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:06.020 align:start position:0%
go out hire child care for them
 
01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
a week after that
 
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter
 
01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:12.420 align:start position:0%
well a week before
 
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
I also want to flag the 25th I think is
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
Yom Kippur the question
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
or the
 
01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.070 align:start position:0%
or the
25th

01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
25th
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
in October 30th that'll be close to
 
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:42.110 align:start position:0%
in October 30th that'll be close to
Halloween

01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's always holidays somewhere
 
01:11:47.689 --> 01:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
so the 25th of October is a year 25th of
 
01:11:47.699 --> 01:11:48.649 align:start position:0%
so the 25th of October is a year 25th of
September

01:11:48.649 --> 01:11:48.659 align:start position:0%
September
 
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
is good October 9th is Halloween uh
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
I have no problem with that
 
01:12:00.290 --> 01:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
until midnight Columbus Day will be a
 
01:12:05.930 --> 01:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:07.860 align:start position:0%
how about um
 
01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
October 10th
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
it's a Tuesday
 
01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
you guys have committee meetings on
 
01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:16.450 align:start position:0%
you guys have committee meetings on
Tuesday

01:12:16.450 --> 01:12:16.460 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
I don't have my calendar
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
I forgot John has scheduled anything
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
I know he's scheduled one day
 
01:12:31.729 --> 01:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
full bore
 
01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
Okay so subcommittee
 
01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
so do you have an objection to Yom
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
Kippur the 25th
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
or just uh you want to just alert it was
 
01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:46.380 align:start position:0%
well over 20. I think more than anything
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure it wasn't a conflict
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
for anybody on the committee it's been a
 
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
long day
 
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
or anybody that we might be inviting I
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
would be yes I think if if you have a
 
01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
religious holiday that if you feel
 
01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
compelled to observe that I think we
 
01:13:02.209 --> 01:13:02.219 align:start position:0%
need to honor that
 
01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
and we just need to be careful that uh
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
if there is a widespread observance of
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
that holiday it doesn't put us into a
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
situation where we don't have a quorum
 
01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.450 align:start position:0%
situation where we don't have a quorum
so

01:13:14.450 --> 01:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I mean if we lose one or two members
 
01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
to a religious holiday as long as we
 
01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
still have a quorum that I'm okay with
 
01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
that but I don't wanna
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
schedule something and then not then
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
lose the Quorum because of that so if
 
01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
you all could what's that
 
01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:33.169 align:start position:0%
you all could what's that
uh

01:13:33.169 --> 01:13:33.179 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
the 25th of this of this month is Yom
 
01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.330 align:start position:0%
the 25th of this of this month is Yom
Kippur

01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:38.340 align:start position:0%
Kippur
 
01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
so if if I would ask you to look at that
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
and if that's a
 
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
an objectionable day for you and and
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
or that's a religious observe and state
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
for you that will cause you to be absent
 
01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
uh let me know and then I'll I can
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
evaluate whether or not would affect our
 
01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
Quorum and 10 9 I think is already off
 
01:14:03.649 --> 01:14:03.659 align:start position:0%
the table because if it's it's a going
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
to be a school holiday so I'm looking at
 
01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:09.780 align:start position:0%
10 10. so let me know if
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh look check the calendar the house
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
calendar and see if it conflicts with
 
01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
any of your regular committee meetings
 
01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.490 align:start position:0%
any of your regular committee meetings
yes

01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
um so I Yom Kippur is one of the Jewish
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
High holy days and I I'm
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
we don't know yet who else we're going
 
01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
to want to come to the committee on that
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
day so it's also going to limit I mean
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have a way of knowing whether
 
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
we'd be inviting somebody who celebrates
 
01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.250 align:start position:0%
we'd be inviting somebody who celebrates
that

01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:37.729 --> 01:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
um and then I also checked with um my
 
01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
family has off school that day so I'm
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
not sure that I'll be available so what
 
01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:47.149 align:start position:0%
do you
yeah

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.729 --> 01:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
I have the trifold and I think it'll
 
01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:54.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
instead of that yeah
 
01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
all right no that sounds great to me
 
01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
let's let's do that let's plan our next
 
01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:11.990 align:start position:0%
let's let's do that let's plan our next
meeting

01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.490 --> 01:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
Jamie did you get that
 
01:15:22.729 --> 01:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
so so that way we can avoid the high
 
01:15:26.330 --> 01:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
holy day Yom Kippur on the 25th and also
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can avoid the
 
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
the Columbus Day holiday on the 9th of
 
01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:33.649 align:start position:0%
the Columbus Day holiday on the 9th of
October

01:15:33.649 --> 01:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
October
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
and so we're going to meet October 2nd
 
01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:38.100 align:start position:0%
and then two weeks after that'll be the
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
16th what's that
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
yeah let's we'll be targeting this the
 
01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.890 align:start position:0%
yeah let's we'll be targeting this the
16th

01:15:45.890 --> 01:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
16th
 
01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:48.260 align:start position:0%
for the next meeting Beyond October 16th
 
01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
October no October 2nd and then 16th
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
right that's that's what I said yeah
 
01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.070 align:start position:0%
right that's that's what I said yeah
yeah

01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
okay I know I won't be able to be there
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
on the 16th but that's
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
I'm the only one carry on
 
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you all right a couple other
 
01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
things I want to talk about I mentioned
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
the rules committee uh that will be
 
01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
available to us to uh to do some
 
01:16:18.649 --> 01:16:18.659 align:start position:0%
legislative action towards the end of
 
01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:20.219 align:start position:0%
the year
 
01:16:20.219 --> 01:16:21.709 align:start position:0%
the year
um

01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
and that uh Matt's got some good input
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
that uh when we start interviewing
 
01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
cheers to call in the ranking members as
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
well so that we we continue to have a
 
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
unified approach here and not just a
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.970 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:16:40.970 --> 01:16:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.550 --> 01:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
one thing that I did want to comment on
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
whether when uh John and I met with the
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
speaker and his staff
 
01:16:51.410 --> 01:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
to give an update as to how our
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
committee was doing but we did that in
 
01:16:55.630 --> 01:16:55.640 align:start position:0%
June and
 
01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
the speaker
 
01:17:00.250 --> 01:17:00.260 align:start position:0%
was pleased I can say this I
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
characterized his mood that he was
 
01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
pleased that we had made some progress
 
01:17:07.010 --> 01:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
that we've got some templates that are
 
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
that are coming especially uh in order
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
to focus we because we have focus focus
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
more on the process
 
01:17:19.570 --> 01:17:19.580 align:start position:0%
thus far in this committee as opposed to
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
actually repealing
 
01:17:26.290 --> 01:17:26.300 align:start position:0%
committees or or commissions
 
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
to be next I guess
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh I I didn't get a sense he didn't say
 
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
he was disappointed the fact that we
 
01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:38.390 align:start position:0%
he was disappointed the fact that we
didn't

01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:17:40.729 --> 01:17:40.739 align:start position:0%
have a whole list of uh committees ready
 
01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
but I get the sense
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
my characteristic
 
01:17:50.990 --> 01:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
characterization that he was a little
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
disappointed that we didn't have that
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
but he understands what we're up against
 
01:17:58.250 --> 01:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
because he's been through this before
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
and uh it was very difficult before
 
01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:03.659 align:start position:0%
especially with the with the whole
 
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
interference of of covid and how covet
 
01:18:10.669 --> 01:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
interrupted uh
 
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
more than we then we can we can really
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
talk about I mean with all the uh the
 
01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
changes in the
 
01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:20.219 align:start position:0%
how we meet and
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
what's a quorum and
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
electronically meetings and so forth so
 
01:18:29.209 --> 01:18:29.219 align:start position:0%
that that's behind us yet we're still
 
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
dealing with the impact of that so he
 
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
understood all that I think he was
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
pleased that we had some plans going
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
forward and he's also pleased with with
 
01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.090 align:start position:0%
forward and he's also pleased with with
uh

01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
staff members that said that they felt
 
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
good about the progress
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
and again focused on the we're focusing
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
on the process
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
it was it was uh it was a take away from
 
01:18:58.010 --> 01:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
me from that meeting with him
 
01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
that he his hope is that by the end of
 
01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:02.100 align:start position:0%
the year
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
we have at least two or three dozen
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
named committees
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
that will will be putting into the
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
category of repeal
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
so if we could set that as our informal
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
Target as we go forward
 
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
that would I think fulfill his
 
01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:23.590 align:start position:0%
that would I think fulfill his
um

01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
desires and I think
 
01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
you can all speak for yourselves but I
 
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
think that that is going to be a a real
 
01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
push for us and that would I think we
 
01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:35.219 align:start position:0%
could declare at least first year
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
Victory uh
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
if we if we did that and then we can
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
build upon that
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
for 2024.
 
01:19:44.159 --> 01:19:45.169 align:start position:0%
for 2024.
um

01:19:45.169 --> 01:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
we got a good list
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
that the staff brought us that gets us
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
up to probably a dozen or so
 
01:19:54.110 --> 01:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at the third line down
 
01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
the commission on demographic Trends I I
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
do know that that uh
 
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
that I there was an already
 
01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
a some legislation brought forward to
 
01:20:10.130 --> 01:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
Edna to
 
01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:13.580 align:start position:0%
to add another committee on Democratic
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
demographic Trends in spite of the fact
 
01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
that this one already exists
 
01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:20.030 align:start position:0%
that this one already exists
and

01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
just by the and it was rejected because
 
01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
by the chairperson because
 
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
we we get so much good data out of unh
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
right now they do this and they do it
 
01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
for us for free
 
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
uh and we don't and we can choose to
 
01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
accept or reject it when it comes but it
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't require a commit a committee or
 
01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
a commission to do anything just to get
 
01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
the data right into the committee and
 
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
then the committee can decide what to do
 
01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
with it so uh that's a
 
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
again a minor Victory but
 
01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:54.659 align:start position:0%
we'll take it if that's all we can get
 
01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
it right now yes
 
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
um do we want to does somebody on this
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee want to file legislation with
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
respect to that list right there this
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
week and there's a couple of reasons for
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
that one is that we
 
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:13.260 align:start position:0%
potentially have legislation that so a
 
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
retained bill
 
01:21:17.209 --> 01:21:17.219 align:start position:0%
has to be acted upon right fair you know
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
within I think by January 3rd right
 
01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
it has to be acted on within a given
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
if we file legislation with that
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
that pretty much opens the door that
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
that could be amended
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
anytime between now and crossover
 
01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
it might just make things a little bit
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
easier I don't know if we have to go
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
back to the rules committee either I
 
01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
think with the two-thirds vote I think
 
01:21:45.649 --> 01:21:45.659 align:start position:0%
we could introduce legislation anytime
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
if I'm not mistaken but it's just
 
01:21:50.750 --> 01:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
another Avenue a suggestion that we
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
might want to put it now or somebody
 
01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:54.659 align:start position:0%
might want to put it in LSR this week
 
01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
with those committees on it
 
01:21:58.260 --> 01:21:59.030 align:start position:0%
with those committees on it
um

01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
have something in place that could be
 
01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
amended either either passed as is or or
 
01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:10.550 align:start position:0%
amended either either passed as is or or
amended

01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:12.169 --> 01:22:12.179 align:start position:0%
I think it makes a lot of sense from
 
01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
just a timeline perspective rather than
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
needing a majority of the rules
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
committee or two-thirds of the house you
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
know to introduce a new bill
 
01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:22.500 align:start position:0%
um to take what we've got here now and
 
01:22:24.410 --> 01:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
then bring an amendment
 
01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
um when it's heard in front of ledge
 
01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
admin or who knows maybe gets assigned
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
to our committee
 
01:22:31.550 --> 01:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
and I've been kind of hoping we'd do
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
something like that so that people could
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
see we're moving forward trying to do
 
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
something to correct the problems we
 
01:22:39.169 --> 01:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
have coming from you Andy who do you
 
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
think might come up here
 
01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
all right come on up there so we can
 
01:22:48.229 --> 01:22:48.239 align:start position:0%
everybody I think it would be good as a
 
01:22:48.239 --> 01:22:49.910 align:start position:0%
everybody I think it would be good as a
placeholder

01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
placeholder
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you what represents petusic just
 
01:22:59.630 --> 01:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
said makes uh Cole fault makes a lot of
 
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
sense but you do have to see that column
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
that where it has the explanation so I
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if you put all nine bills on
 
01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
there automatically because I think
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
maybe like representative hunt I believe
 
01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
is putting in repeal language for
 
01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
something and I believe representative
 
01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:15.500 align:start position:0%
Harrington is putting in repeal language
 
01:23:19.130 --> 01:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
so maybe uh you you do put in a bill
 
01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:20.219 align:start position:0%
because that's what we used to do we
 
01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
used to have one bill that will list all
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
the repeals and maybe that's what you do
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
as a placeholder and start off with
 
01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
would that be a bill that would be put
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
in through the wedgie admin or is that a
 
01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
standalone bill that I I think what
 
01:23:34.729 --> 01:23:34.739 align:start position:0%
representative Koval just said to just
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
put in an LSR
 
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
um right now that that you would start
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
the list but you'd have to look at the
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
list that you have and decide which ones
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
would be in there because there are some
 
01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
that explain why they're still in
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
existence and some well a strategy could
 
01:23:52.270 --> 01:23:52.280 align:start position:0%
be to put them all on the list and then
 
01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
we can always edit edit the uh the LSR
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
we could line a few out if they're not
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
ready or if we made a mistake or
 
01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.149 align:start position:0%
ready or if we made a mistake or
whatever

01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
and change it that in that way what do
 
01:24:06.169 --> 01:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
you what do you think
 
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
I I agree or you know the whatever
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee it's assigned to can can
 
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
essentially work with it from there with
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
a recommendation an informal
 
01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation from this committee well
 
01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
captures all not nine of these right
 
01:24:27.649 --> 01:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
I believe so it captures all nine of
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
these would it would
 
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
suspect the speaker would assign that
 
01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
out to because it would have come to us
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
come to assigned to our committee I
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
think it would be it speaker is going to
 
01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
start assigning bills to the child care
 
01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
committee and the housing committee
 
01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
which are also special committee so I
 
01:24:44.630 --> 01:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
imagine we can make a strong case for it
 
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
to be assigned here
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
and I I would make the recommendation
 
01:24:50.750 --> 01:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
there's what's still unclear to me is
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
what's the process we're using to make
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
sure that the right commissions end up
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
on this list because uh
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know the political ramifications
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
putting all nine of these on here and
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
finally it is an LSR it could be that we
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
just file it with one for now but we
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
know we're absolutely committed to
 
01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.189 align:start position:0%
know we're absolutely committed to
repealing

01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
repealing
 
01:25:11.630 --> 01:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
um but I think that's something we need
 
01:25:13.130 --> 01:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
to flesh out as a committee is figure
 
01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
out like yes we're inviting chairs and
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
ranking members to join us to offer
 
01:25:20.090 --> 01:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
feedback about bills that are in there
 
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh under their jurisdiction but what's
 
01:25:25.010 --> 01:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
the process we're going to go through
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
what's the standard what are the you
 
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:29.219 align:start position:0%
know similar to the tri-fold what are
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
the things that need to be part of a
 
01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
commission in order to create one what
 
01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
are the things that we're looking for
 
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
what's the criteria we're using to
 
01:25:38.090 --> 01:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
decide what end up on this list because
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's no small thing I all for you know
 
01:25:44.510 --> 01:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
removing some committees and commissions
 
01:25:47.770 --> 01:25:47.780 align:start position:0%
that are some commissions that we
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
deem are you know inactive that's one
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
thing right but if it's uh you know if
 
01:25:57.410 --> 01:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
it's duplicative how do we determine
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's duplicative I just
 
01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
think we need to have some conversations
 
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
to figure out what that is but agreed um
 
01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
my my intention was simply to sort of
 
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
get the ball rolling so that we have a
 
01:26:11.770 --> 01:26:11.780 align:start position:0%
placeholder so that's
 
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
in a
 
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
practically speaking
 
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
one of the ways to do this is to pick
 
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
one that we're sure of yeah and then add
 
01:26:24.129 --> 01:26:24.139 align:start position:0%
to it
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
on some discussion we could add up to
 
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:28.860 align:start position:0%
nine so
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
eight more or the reverse put all nine
 
01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
on there and start deleting ones that
 
01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
we're not sure
 
01:26:37.970 --> 01:26:37.980 align:start position:0%
if you have any
 
01:26:41.209 --> 01:26:41.219 align:start position:0%
representative yeah I I'm agreeing with
 
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
what everyone's saying I'm thinking once
 
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
a bill is drafted and I'll it'll come
 
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
back so that we can have a look at it
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
before it's finally signed off we've got
 
01:26:51.890 --> 01:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
it what's our window of opportunity
 
01:26:54.410 --> 01:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
there how many days is there a limit
 
01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:57.300 align:start position:0%
I've forgotten I I don't know what
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
you're I don't know what I mean I know a
 
01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
deadline is Friday but then after that
 
01:27:02.689 --> 01:27:02.699 align:start position:0%
once it's drafted out yeah that's not
 
01:27:05.209 --> 01:27:05.219 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking today 10 days and then
 
01:27:07.610 --> 01:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
they all have to be this is drafted
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
what's drafted I don't think we're going
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
to have time to review it at our
 
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
our next meeting
 
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
on October the 2nd yeah I I think that
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
too much time on the calendar will tick
 
01:27:31.729 --> 01:27:31.739 align:start position:0%
off and then it will die I think we've
 
01:27:33.229 --> 01:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
got 10 days to
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
um right so we'll have we'll have 10
 
01:27:37.129 --> 01:27:37.139 align:start position:0%
days once OLS sends it back to the prime
 
01:27:37.139 --> 01:27:38.390 align:start position:0%
days once OLS sends it back to the prime
sponsor

01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
01:27:40.610 --> 01:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
10 days for the prime sponsor and also
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
all co-sponsors to sign off
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
01:27:49.729 --> 01:27:49.739 align:start position:0%
um I think November 2nd is the final
 
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
date for all sign-offs whether or not
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
they get you have the 10 days or not
 
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
um November 2nd I think is the is the
 
01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
final date
 
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:00.780 align:start position:0%
the Senate has a different schedule
 
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we want to do this as a
 
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
Senate bill but I mean that's just
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
another comment here
 
01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
um so they have a wider window of
 
01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity so yeah I mean I I guess my
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
my thought based on what you said
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
um is that we probably want to just take
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
the the most obvious one that we want to
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
repeal one
 
01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.550 align:start position:0%
repeal one
uh

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh one commission and uh draft a bill
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
somebody needs to step forward as the
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of that
 
01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.169 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of that
um

01:28:35.169 --> 01:28:35.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
that person presumably cannot fully
 
01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
participate in debate on the bill once
 
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
it comes if it comes to this committee
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
so we might want to have someone outside
 
01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:47.219 align:start position:0%
of this committee do that
 
01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
um it just seems to me that like with
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
with a we could relatively easily put a
 
01:28:55.850 --> 01:28:55.860 align:start position:0%
placeholder in effect now that would
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.239 --> 01:29:02.689 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:29:02.689 --> 01:29:02.699 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
open yourself check with John Hunt he
 
01:29:06.770 --> 01:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
said he was going to put in a bill to
 
01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
kill one that'll be the bill
 
01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:12.910 align:start position:0%
kill one that'll be the bill
okay

01:29:12.910 --> 01:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
that'll be the place
 
01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
the fourth line down
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
the commission on the status of Health
 
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
coverage markets for individuals and
 
01:29:36.530 --> 01:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
small employers
 
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that one sunsets at the end of 2024
 
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:41.219 align:start position:0%
yeah anyway so it
 
01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
probably the easiest and least
 
01:29:45.169 --> 01:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
controversial here exactly would be my
 
01:29:45.179 --> 01:29:47.649 align:start position:0%
controversial here exactly would be my
guess

01:29:47.649 --> 01:29:47.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
amend the crap out of it later you know
 
01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
this one Well we'd have to amend it
 
01:29:56.570 --> 01:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
prior to our next meeting because the
 
01:29:59.330 --> 01:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
deadline no not if it's assigned to us
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
as a committee if it's assigned to us as
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
a committee or any other committee we
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
can propose amendments through the
 
01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
committee process and then basically up
 
01:30:12.229 --> 01:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
until Crossover with those amendments
 
01:30:14.090 --> 01:30:14.100 align:start position:0%
those amendments add additional
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
commissions to be deleted
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
and and I would assume that
 
01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
I mean worst case
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
some you know the speaker says it's
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
non-germaine and we have to hold it a
 
01:30:27.050 --> 01:30:27.060 align:start position:0%
non-germaine Amendment hearing
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
but I I I yeah I doubt we're going to
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
get a crowd for that so
 
01:30:35.629 --> 01:30:35.639 align:start position:0%
again just just suggesting that if we
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
want to do that this week as the window
 
01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
of opportunity to do it
 
01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
and if if we think that representative
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
Hunt is going to be filing a bill we
 
01:30:46.610 --> 01:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
need to make sure so that
 
01:30:49.729 --> 01:30:49.739 align:start position:0%
we don't miss the Wednesday to write the
 
01:30:49.739 --> 01:30:51.229 align:start position:0%
we don't miss the Wednesday to write the
LSR

01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
LSR
 
01:30:51.239 --> 01:30:54.129 align:start position:0%
LSR
yeah

01:30:54.129 --> 01:30:54.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:57.649 --> 01:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
I'll actually be seeing him tomorrow my
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
morning at a meeting yeah
 
01:31:03.169 --> 01:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
and can ask him what his intense is and
 
01:31:04.729 --> 01:31:04.739 align:start position:0%
see that the committee is considering
 
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
filing legislation to repeal
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
would that be agreeable well all right
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
Next Step you know after that meeting is
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
to identify an author of The LSR yes I
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
think it's representative hunt I think
 
01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
it sounds like representative pun's
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
already going to file the LSR he's
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
already planning to file that one it's
 
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
just confirming that he's going to get
 
01:31:28.129 --> 01:31:28.139 align:start position:0%
it in this week and I think that's what
 
01:31:30.169 --> 01:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
representative law is going to do
 
01:31:30.179 --> 01:31:31.790 align:start position:0%
representative law is going to do
okay

01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:31:33.890 --> 01:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
sounds like a plan to me
 
01:31:40.810 --> 01:31:40.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
anybody I think it would it would be
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
helpful if some of us maybe signed up to
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
be co-sponsors
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
or representative hunt
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
or does that mean we can't discuss it
 
01:31:56.990 --> 01:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
as co-sponsors we may not be
 
01:31:59.209 --> 01:31:59.219 align:start position:0%
able to participate fully in the
 
01:31:59.219 --> 01:32:01.070 align:start position:0%
able to participate fully in the
discussion

01:32:01.070 --> 01:32:01.080 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
If he if he sponsors it
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's an insurance bill it's going to
 
01:32:11.689 --> 01:32:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.699 --> 01:32:13.149 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:32:13.149 --> 01:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm on the subcommittee
 
01:32:18.890 --> 01:32:18.900 align:start position:0%
and you're good with that representative
 
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
hunt uh
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:30.950 align:start position:0%
 
understanding

01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative wall you're going to
 
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
speak to him specifically about this
 
01:32:36.169 --> 01:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
issue and what our strategy is
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
that would work I'm happy to talk to
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
them about that
 
01:32:42.050 --> 01:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
um he's chairing the Committees I'll be
 
01:32:46.129 --> 01:32:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:48.620 align:start position:0%
I talk to him all the time anyway
 
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
and it could be that we asked him to add
 
01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:53.390 align:start position:0%
and it could be that we asked him to add
another

01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
one or two commissions that we feel like
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know are also pretty
 
01:33:00.169 --> 01:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
non-controversial because then if
 
01:33:02.330 --> 01:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of subject matters I
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
think it will increase the likelihood of
 
01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
it being assigned to this committee and
 
01:33:10.490 --> 01:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
okay and uh what I can do is I can get a
 
01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
message to the speaker because as he
 
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
assigns these these uh to the Committees
 
01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
maybe I can convince them just to sign
 
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.410 --> 01:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
and this will be kind of a test a test
 
01:33:30.169 --> 01:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
bed for us with this first uh effort
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
right because I know he's looking for us
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
to stop making some progress and he can
 
01:33:37.010 --> 01:33:37.020 align:start position:0%
help us by assigning it to us
 
01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
yeah he'll be happy to see there's a
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
bill right
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay good I think that's uh
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
good progress
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any final comments
 
01:33:51.290 --> 01:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
before we we close our session it
 
01:33:52.970 --> 01:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
covered everything I was planning on
 
01:33:55.669 --> 01:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah we got some good input I like the
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
fact that they're inviting ranking
 
01:34:02.810 --> 01:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
members I think that's good input for to
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
could we look to do that to invite the
 
01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
committee chair star are we a few
 
01:34:12.050 --> 01:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
meetings out from that or are we
 
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
thinking I think I'll take that on as a
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
project I was just curious
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
who the who the chairs are that are
 
01:34:22.729 --> 01:34:22.739 align:start position:0%
candidates for this yeah and I'll I'll
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh I'll I'll work with Anne and we'll
 
01:34:28.070 --> 01:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
see about uh inviting them putting them
 
01:34:30.169 --> 01:34:30.179 align:start position:0%
on the agenda if you will of our
 
01:34:33.649 --> 01:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
our upcoming meetings so that we we can
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
kick off a discussion let's say a one
 
01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
o'clock discussion and then maybe at 1
 
01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
15 or 1 30 we start you know chairman X
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
and ranking member y are going to talk
 
01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
to us oh we're going to talk to them
 
01:34:51.290 --> 01:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
about about this and maybe another half
 
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
hour we could have another one come in
 
01:34:55.729 --> 01:34:55.739 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm thinking two or three for a
 
01:34:57.729 --> 01:34:57.739 align:start position:0%
meeting does that sound right to you
 
01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
it is the idea that we would talk to
 
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
them sort of about what we're trying to
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
do here initially and then potentially
 
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
invite them back with you know to come
 
01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
back with a list as you suggested with
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
the potential technique
 
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
or I could prep them ahead of time
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
okay and then probably in that case we
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
give them a little more time before
 
01:35:22.250 --> 01:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
before the date we give them to come in
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
right obviously to prepare but okay I
 
01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
was just curious I guess either way that
 
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
any other comments or feedback
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
good suggestions thank you and thank you
 
01:35:37.129 --> 01:35:37.139 align:start position:0%

01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
nail down some
 
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
some guest speakers if you will and do
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
you have any thoughts about whether you

next meeting
 
01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.850 align:start position:0%
next meeting
we

01:36:13.850 --> 01:36:13.860 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
to explain triple okay
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
all right let's let's I think I think
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's healthier for us to plan on it if
 
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
we have to cancel it off the agenda
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
we'll cancel it but let's plan because
 
01:36:26.689 --> 01:36:26.699 align:start position:0%
we have three weeks
 
01:36:26.699 --> 01:36:29.209 align:start position:0%
we have three weeks
so

01:36:29.209 --> 01:36:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.219 --> 01:36:33.050 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:36:33.050 --> 01:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
