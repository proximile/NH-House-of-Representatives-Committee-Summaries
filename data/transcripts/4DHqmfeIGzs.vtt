00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair and other members of the
 
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Josh Earth I am
 
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
a sergeant with New Hampshire State
 
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
Police Marine Patrol I'm here to speak
 
00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 1046 which is basically
 
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
ads teeth to an existing statute um that
 
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
would require the registered owner or
 
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
the owner of a boat to report um a
 
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
reportable boating accident I think the
 
00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
couple of key takeaways here to this is
 
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
it could be property damage only we had
 
00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 align:start position:0%
a case like that if I was to recall your
 
00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 align:start position:0%
attention back to this last summer in
 
00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 align:start position:0%
Winter Harbor on Lake wiip pasak um
 
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
close call High property damage where a
 
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 align:start position:0%
boat went through a dock and uh and
 
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
through a hacker craft antique style
 
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
boat that was at the dock uh that had
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
been occupied just moments before um in
 
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
addition to that though this could
 
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
simply be a bodily injury style um event
 
00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
that could happen and we had one of
 
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
those just within the last couple of
 
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
weeks over on the wiip River so
 
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
what this does is it puts the onus on
 
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
the owner of the boat if the operator
 
00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 align:start position:0%
fails to comply with the statute it's
 
00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
not fail prooof it does still require
 
00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
culpability so that means we'd have to
 
00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
the state would have to prove
 
00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
culpability that the owner did know that
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
that boat was involved in an accident
 
00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 align:start position:0%
but if we could prove that then that
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
would give the state um some additional
 
00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 align:start position:0%
teeth to bring those people accountable
 
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
that were involved with this voting
 
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
accident I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
that people might have about the
 
00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.430 align:start position:0%
that people might have about the
existing

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
statute so we will get to questions in
 
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
just one second for our committee
 
00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 align:start position:0%
members um we thought that what you have
 
00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
in front of you are actually the Senate
 
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
bills that were assigned to our
 
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee and uh Brad has been kind
 
00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
enough to pass down copies of the bill
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
that were over there so we're all going
 
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
to just need one second because
 
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we haven't seen this yet
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
um my law book is in the other room so
 
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 align:start position:0%
we may need that as well um but let's
 
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
start is that's being passed around
 
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
I think I saw a ton of questions where
 
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
we at uh representative cig thank you
 
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
very much and thank you I know I'm
 
00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
behind the speaker it's hard to see me
 
00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
um so I'm curious um as someone who
 
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
votes on wiip there are a lot of uh
 
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
companies that rent boats um so
 
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
therefore they're the owner you know
 
00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
various marinas that rent boats um and
 
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm curious just how um how this
 
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
would work for someone who you know how
 
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
how are they going to know in some of
 
00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 align:start position:0%
these circumstances es to be able to
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
report if the I mean obviously there's
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
paperwork that they tell people they're
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to do these things but since we
 
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
know people sometimes forget to make
 
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
good choices I'm curious how that
 
00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
relates back to
 
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
that great question so I'm going to try
 
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
to maintain eye contact and so you can
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
hear me as well um so I think it's
 
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
specifically to address your question
 
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
about rentals every time a rental comes
 
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
back um in from being used they do an
 
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
assessment on it typically they'll pull
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
that boat all the way out of the water
 
00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 align:start position:0%
to check the boat for any signs of
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
damage um some renters find hard water
 
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 align:start position:0%
out there okay in other words they hit a
 
00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:07.639 align:start position:0%
rock they cause some type of damage to
 
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
the out drive and then of course they
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
fix that the threshold in New Hampshire
 
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 align:start position:0%
is $2,000 worth of damage either to one
 
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
boat multiple boats or to include
 
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
property damage of something else a dock
 
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
is a good example of that so when that
 
00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
happens um yes the owners then would
 
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
transfer to them as the owner to make
 
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
sure they're reporting it to Marine
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
Patrol uh so that we can investigate
 
00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
that voting accident thank you're
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
Stone thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh looking at
 
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
this bill it basically kind of mirrors
 
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
the uh conduct after an accident Statute
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
in the motor vehicle code is that your
 
00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 align:start position:0%
interpretation of
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
it yes sir it does if if we go far
 
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
enough back I'm going to say about 20
 
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
years ago there was a fatal boating
 
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
crash that took place in on Lake
 
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
winaki um and none of this statute none
 
00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 align:start position:0%
of this language existed then and so
 
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
really although we knew the operator we
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
knew the boat we had nothing to fall
 
00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
back on and so after that uh in the in
 
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
the wake of that this statute really
 
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
developed a lot of these reporting teeth
 
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
and the conduct after this simply just
 
00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 align:start position:0%
adds another um piece to it if you will
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
to um again hold people accountable if
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
they know that the boat was involved in
 
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.749 --> 00:07:36.759 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Newman yes hi
 
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I have very I don't have any
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
experience with boats but as in in
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
current uh um I guess in the current
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
time that we're in so many houses and
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
cars have security cameras do you see
 
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
that or are aware of that people with
 
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
docks or maybe even on their own boats
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
that have security cameras to help with
 
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
thing that's a great question uh on
 
00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:10.919 align:start position:0%
boats no on some of your larger boats
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
perhaps what we are seeing more and more
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
of though are security cameras that are
 
00:08:17.589 --> 00:08:17.599 align:start position:0%
fixed to people's docks because so much
 
00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:19.639 align:start position:0%
of it can be done Wireless now and then
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
it goes real time to the phone the other
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
part that we are seeing is everyone has
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
a cell phone so if I cause a crash or if
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
I'm in any way involved because it's
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
voting related it's somewhat
 
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
sensationalized to begin with people I
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
think instinctually take out their cell
 
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
phone and record it I'll go back to the
 
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
event that happened this last summer up
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
in Winter Harbor some of the best
 
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
evidence that we had was was people's
 
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
cell phone footage so although not a
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
security camera I think it goes to in
 
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
line with what you're asking about thank
 
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
you welcome so just for committee
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
members that have never been on a boat I
 
00:08:59.550 --> 00:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
will let you know that I was was
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
actually involved in a boating accident
 
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
once and friend of mine had a very nice
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
boat had a toddler and a car seat on the
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
boat and the boat that I was in was hit
 
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
by a person operating a rental boat and
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
put a nice giant hole in the side of the
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
boat that I was in and while we were
 
00:09:23.949 --> 00:09:23.959 align:start position:0%
about to be hit with SBO the operator
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
dived into the water because he
 
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
panicked then his wife that was driving
 
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.949 align:start position:0%
panicked then his wife that was driving
the

00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:31.959 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
boat pulled away left him in the water
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
because she was paranoid and panicked
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
because she was in a rental boat that
 
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
person knew that they were involved in a
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
wreck it was very obvious but had no
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
intention of letting the boat company or
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
the rental company know that they hit
 
00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
the boat and I believe if I'm not
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
mistaken is that what this is like
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
addressing that's one of many examples
 
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519 align:start position:0%
where this would be a app so the onus
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
like all criminal statutes right is on
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
the state to be able to prove that
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
culpability so knowingly does come into
 
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
Muse I'm wondering how this uh uh
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill uh and and the
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
requirements for uh for owners uh
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
compare to I guess comparable motor veh
 
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
vehicle law um I think one of the things
 
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
that um uh I know I look for sometimes
 
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
is to try to make sure that if we're
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
changing the law for one thing we're not
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily doing something that would
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
be completely out of line with how we
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
handle it in a different area so is
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
there something comparable like this for
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle
 
00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:52.839 align:start position:0%
owners I I would make the argument sir
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
that it is comparable in other words it
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
parallels it so if we had a motor
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle that was involved in an accident
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
let's say a hit and run and then they
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
drive away but someone had a cell phone
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
and they snapped the picture took a
 
00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:06.519 align:start position:0%
video and they had the license plate and
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
then it comes back to somebody else if I
 
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
again if I can attach the owner to it
 
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they knowingly did it
 
00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
in other words the vehicle wasn't taken
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
without their consent then I think you
 
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
have that Nexus and I think that this is
 
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it cleans it up
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
and it um again allows us to be able to
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
go after the registered owner if that
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
operator for some reason is not
 
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
reporting so again this isn't um an
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
owner that is now a victim this is an
 
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
owner that knows that their boat was
 
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
involved and is simply failing to
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
report thank you welcome
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
Newman so let me just see if I can
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
summarize what I think this bill is
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
trying to do the operator has to make is
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
supposed to make a report and they if
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
they can't or they won't or they
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
refuse then as soon as as the oper not
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
the owner of the boat then becomes the
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
one responsible for making a report as
 
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
soon as they find out and if they fail
 
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
to do it and the change here is if they
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
fail to do it immediately when they find
 
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
out then they are then subject to the
 
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
Penalty and the penalty is a class A
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and that was not changed so
 
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
it's only about the immediacy and who's
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for making the
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
reports that's correct sir thank
 
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.069 align:start position:0%
reports that's correct sir thank
you

00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
any any other questions am I missing
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
anybody's hands oh Representative
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
no thank you and um thank you for taking
 
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
my question um so I'm just wondering
 
00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
especially when it talks about you know
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
somebody getting into an accident um and
 
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
um the owner needing to report um who
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily be operating the
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
boat at that time I think in in some of
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
the ex all the examples that we've heard
 
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
so far there will be a lot of damage
 
00:12:59.790 --> 00:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
with that um and you know I'm just
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
thinking about other examples that may
 
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
not cause immediate damage um and rather
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
than a rental it might be somebody who's
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
lending their boat to somebody else or
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
or other situations like that and so I
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm wondering is about the
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
burden of proof that that person
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
actually knew that that boat was
 
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
involved in an accident or you know what
 
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.990 align:start position:0%
involved in an accident or you know what
I

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
mean that that's a great point and um we
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
can't completely mitigate that so um
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
that threshold for us on the Boating
 
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
side um is $2,000 worth of damage and so
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
if it was less than that um even if
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
damage occurred whether it be property
 
00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:37.839 align:start position:0%
or to the boat now you're simply looking
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
at a a civil claim um best case scenario
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
um if it's injury related so beyond
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
first aid then that would automatically
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
trigger um that reporting requirement it
 
00:13:51.189 --> 00:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
does not change though us having to be
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
able to say is the owner aware of the
 
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that this accident took place
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
and upon being aware of did they take
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
the action to report it um so it's I it
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
would not be accurate if I said it would
 
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
apply in all situations or if it's a
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
fail safe it is not okay thank you
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
welcome anybody
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
else set well thank you very much for
 
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
your testimony we appreciate it thank
 
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
it is there anybody else here that
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify that has not turned
 
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
into C all right well that being said I
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
will close the public hearing for House
 
00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.230 align:start position:0%
will close the public hearing for House
Bill

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
1046 and to our committee members um
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative Roy is at the Senate uh
 
00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519 align:start position:0%
getting ready to testify on our bill
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
bills so we do have executive session
 
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
that starts at 10 o'clock however I
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
think we would all agree that uh me
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
opening and recessing the 10:00 hearing
 
00:14:59.069 --> 00:14:59.079 align:start position:0%
or the 10:00 executive session in in
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
order for him to help get our bills
 
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
through the Senate is definitely a good
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
thing so with that being said I have to
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
be here to open our executive session at
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
10:00 but anybody that would like to go
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
to the Senate and tell them to pass our
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
bail bills uh if you just let me know
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
that you're going to do that we have to
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
we have to go into recess anyway because
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
he's not here representative
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
Newman at at 10:00 we are going to be

yes please thank you Mr chairman uh I
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to talk about this
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
bill too much we got three bills on the
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
docket today and I think we may have a
 
01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get out before 5:00 p.m.
 
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
which would be nice given how much work
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
we've done in the last couple of weeks
 
01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:57.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is essentially a bill to make
 
01:30:00.669 --> 01:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
sure that people who have rehabilitated
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
themselves and are out of prison and
 
01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
people who
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
are trying to get a job again can have
 
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:12.280 align:start position:0%
their records un olded from uh a charge
 
01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
which at this moment is uh be in the
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
process of being uh legalized by the New
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state house and by many
 
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
metrics for industry standards is uh no
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
longer something that they're going
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
after so we're we're hoping to get it to
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
the point where we're not as I said in
 
01:30:36.189 --> 01:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
my testimony in a situation where we've
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
legalized and then people who and the
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
state is sanctioning smoking selling and
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh the use of cannabis while people are
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
still in jail for smoking selling and
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
using uh cannabis so and having that on
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
their records um this keeps people from
 
01:30:57.550 --> 01:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
being able to get loans and Etc and
 
01:30:59.709 --> 01:30:59.719 align:start position:0%
that's why we have an analment statute I
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
think the automatic analment statute
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
that's put in this bill which is really
 
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
the uh most important piece to my mind
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh is uh well crafted and done a good
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
job there only 6% of people uh in an
 
01:31:16.189 --> 01:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
nments generally this is a national
 
01:31:18.910 --> 01:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
statistic during get their an nments
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
they don't petition the court because
 
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
they either don't know or they are
 
01:31:25.109 --> 01:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
unaware that it's available to be an
 
01:31:27.790 --> 01:31:27.800 align:start position:0%
olded um so that's why it's important I
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
think in this bill to have that
 
01:31:32.030 --> 01:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
automatic analment statute which would
 
01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
not be an own Rous cost for dos as we
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
talked about in the testimony this is
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
not something that uh thousands and
 
01:31:40.590 --> 01:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
thousands of people are going to be
 
01:31:44.109 --> 01:31:44.119 align:start position:0%
eligible for very few people have only a
 
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:46.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis conviction on their record but
 
01:31:50.669 --> 01:31:50.679 align:start position:0%
it's those people who are so wrapped up
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
in the system that they can't they
 
01:31:55.149 --> 01:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
they've uh they made a mistake and they
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
serve their time and they'd like to get
 
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:00.400 align:start position:0%
that uh anold um it allows for re a
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
resentencing petition uh the Court's
 
01:32:05.310 --> 01:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
standards on that are pretty high and I
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
think that we can uh you know I have
 
01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
faith in the court system and the
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
Judiciary here to make sure that nobody
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
who has um any other and as it states in
 
01:32:15.709 --> 01:32:15.719 align:start position:0%
the bill nobody who has any other extra
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
crime or anything on their record can
 
01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
get that resentencing and that
 
01:32:21.629 --> 01:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
resentencing bar even if it is just a
 
01:32:24.109 --> 01:32:24.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis charge is very high as well um
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
so this isn't going to create any uh
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
crazy situation this is just going to
 
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
allow for people who want to be fully
 
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:33.719 align:start position:0%
functioning members of society again to
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
have their records cleaned from
 
01:32:39.149 --> 01:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
something that uh We've determined is
 
01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
decriminalized so with that Mr chairman
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
I will get off my soap box and thank you
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak and uh I
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate you for taking up this bill
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
um represent Murray would you like to
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
speak to your second thank you Mr chair
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
um I I think the previous speaker
 
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
covered it very adequately I would just
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
reiterate that um we did just pass a
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
legalization bill out of the house and I
 
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
always said I could not support
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
legalization without um anuling those
 
01:33:09.149 --> 01:33:09.159 align:start position:0%
who have been criminalized for something
 
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
that were now trying to um allow to be
 
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
sold in the state so I do support the
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
OTP motion on this
 
01:33:20.669 --> 01:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you um the concern I have
 
01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
with this bill um is that it raised
 
01:33:29.109 --> 01:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
is the legal limit of of cannabis versus
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
the what's already legal or I believe
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
even contemplated could you address that
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
I can Mr chairman so somebody would have
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
to serve out their sentence uh to
 
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
petition for Anan you could petition for
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
resentencing but like I just said that's
 
01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
a high bar um you you
 
01:33:50.109 --> 01:33:50.119 align:start position:0%
the in most cases somebody's going to
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
have served out their sentence and have
 
01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
completed the sentence on what would be
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
a marijuana charge for uh 2 oun or less
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
and then that person uh can get the
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
analment but that's after they have
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
served their sentence so I I don't see
 
01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:06.830 align:start position:0%
served their sentence so I I don't see
it

01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
as uh legalizing as you put
 
01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
it represent Murray you wanted to
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
address that yes thank you Mr chair um
 
01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
so am I correct in saying that um this
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
isn't changing the current possession
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
limits because that's an a different
 
01:34:26.669 --> 01:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
part of Statute and this is only related
 
01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
to um The Possession limits that are
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
referred to regarding annulments correct
 
01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and it's more it's more personal
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
use amounts for an for what would be
 
01:34:39.550 --> 01:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
eligible for
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
annulments um represent Willie you had
 
01:34:44.109 --> 01:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
just said that um the person has to
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
serve out their sentence but on line 30
 
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
of Page Three it says any person who was
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
convicted of any cannabis related
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
offense who has not completed their
 
01:34:55.709 --> 01:34:55.719 align:start position:0%
sentence May at any time petition the
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
court in which the person was convicted
 
01:34:57.199 --> 01:34:58.669 align:start position:0%
court in which the person was convicted
for

01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:35:00.629 --> 01:35:00.639 align:start position:0%
resentencing well I don't want to say
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
you misheard me but I I you might have
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
might have I I I I but I no it's not you
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
you're able to petition for analment if
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
you're still convicted but if you're
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
still convicted that's a much much
 
01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
higher bar than if you're completed your
 
01:35:19.709 --> 01:35:19.719 align:start position:0%
sentence and and that's complete there
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh so you're able to petition for that
 
01:35:23.950 --> 01:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't guarantee that you're
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
going to get it from the court it
 
01:35:27.109 --> 01:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't guarantee that you're going to
 
01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
have your sentence resentenced it
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't guarantee that you're going to
 
01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
get an analment it's just allowing you
 
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
to have that petitioned by the court and
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
anyone who petitions I would imagine
 
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
thinks that they have a case for getting
 
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.149 align:start position:0%
thinks that they have a case for getting
that

01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
analment if if the the legalization bill
 
01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
that we passed doesn't pass the other
 
01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
body or isn't signed by the
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
executive is there does this still go
 
01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
through or is there a trigger is it
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
connected did no this is a separate bill
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
that works in tandem with 1633 um this
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
system would ensure that people can as I
 
01:36:04.590 --> 01:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
stated in my testimony get their
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
annulments and the 2 oun limit is
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
because people aren't arrested for 3/4
 
01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
of an ounce and people were talking
 
01:36:12.830 --> 01:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
about their cannabis charges being able
 
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
to sort of get you know as I said get
 
01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:15.880 align:start position:0%
back into jobs get their loans people
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
who have uh rehabilitated themselves or
 
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
shown a path to Rehabilitation and uh
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
no I guess for clarification what I'm
 
01:36:29.070 --> 01:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
asking is if the if the legalization
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
fails right now it's still illegal
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
unless you have a medical card if the
 
01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
unless you have a medical card if the
legalization

01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
legalization
 
01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
fails this bill does not go into effect
 
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
and or it would because otherwise if it
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
does go into affect anyway this in in
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
effect legalizes it through the back
 
01:36:47.189 --> 01:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
door saying well you can be convicted
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
but we're just going to anull it I'm
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
trying to is there a I hear what you're
 
01:36:53.950 --> 01:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
saying definitely when we talked about
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
this in the test in in the uh hearing um
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
but it's a high bar to get your analment
 
01:37:04.149 --> 01:37:04.159 align:start position:0%
it's a high bar to get your resentence
 
01:37:05.709 --> 01:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not like you can just say
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
to the court I'd like it an olded and
 
01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
the Court's going to throw you throw you
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
onto the streets out of jail you you
 
01:37:13.709 --> 01:37:13.719 align:start position:0%
have to go to the court get your hearing
 
01:37:15.149 --> 01:37:15.159 align:start position:0%
and then the court and the judge has to
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not you're eligible
 
01:37:18.950 --> 01:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
for the analment or the resentencing and
 
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:22.360 align:start position:0%
when they do that most often we we have
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
a high bar with our court system we have
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
a good court system here I mean it's
 
01:37:27.870 --> 01:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
going to take uh that person's going to
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
have to really have a case for an nments
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to to pass that bar so it
 
01:37:33.070 --> 01:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
won't be everyone who's convicted for a
 
01:37:35.149 --> 01:37:35.159 align:start position:0%
marijuana charge can just say oh hey
 
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler passed 1539 so I
 
01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
can get out of jail free no it's not
 
01:37:41.589 --> 01:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
it's that it's very clear what isn't is
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
not eligible for annulments in the bill
 
01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:44.950 align:start position:0%
not eligible for annulments in the bill
um

01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
so all I'd have to say is the personal
 
01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
use amount for eligibility for an nments
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
yes would be uh that but I it's not
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
it's not legalization because you're
 
01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
still being able to be arrested
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
convicted sentenced and serve out your
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
full sentence if the court determines
 
01:38:03.550 --> 01:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
that you're not eligible for an nments
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
which would mean that it's not legalized
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you every time Murray did you have
 
01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
something else to say Thank you Mr chair
 
01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I would just add on to that that um
 
01:38:14.669 --> 01:38:14.679 align:start position:0%
you know the position of the house has
 
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
been to support legalization we passed a
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
bill to do so a couple weeks ago and I
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
think if the other body chooses a
 
01:38:24.589 --> 01:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
different position and itl's that bill
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's safe to assume that they would also
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
itl this one and so I think it would
 
01:38:32.109 --> 01:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
make sense for us to move forward um
 
01:38:33.550 --> 01:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
considering the position of the house
 
01:38:35.229 --> 01:38:35.239 align:start position:0%
which is passing that legalization Bill
 
01:38:37.229 --> 01:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
and that we also want to pass this
 
01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
coinciding with that and if the other
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
body chooses different action then they
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
choose different
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
action I would um caution you against
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
using logic anymore
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
um representative Stone thank you Mr
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
chair uh I'll be voting against against
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
this bill at this time uh under R say
 
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
6515 we already have an analment
 
01:39:00.669 --> 01:39:00.679 align:start position:0%
mechanism that's in place for all
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
classification of crimes regardless if
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
it was marijuana connected or you know
 
01:39:06.990 --> 01:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
another lower level non-narcotic
 
01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
possession or other various charges with
 
01:39:11.709 --> 01:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
that said if you look at the statute
 
01:39:13.390 --> 01:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
most misdemeanor A's and Bs are a
 
01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
threeyear span of time from completion
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
of sentencing in which you allows you to
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
anal by petitioning the court uh since
 
01:39:21.070 --> 01:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
there's a mechanism for analment already
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
I think it would be more prudent to look
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
at the an process in today's uh techn
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
technology is Advanced since this was
 
01:39:29.709 --> 01:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
originally passed back forments and we
 
01:39:30.990 --> 01:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
could probably streamline the process
 
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
but I really have a hard issue on
 
01:39:35.149 --> 01:39:35.159 align:start position:0%
isolating just marijuana offenses for an
 
01:39:36.589 --> 01:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
alment in addition I want to make sure
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
that we are only targeting you know uh
 
01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:41.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor level offenses uh violations
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
I don't want to see uh felon level drug
 
01:39:45.550 --> 01:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
dealing offenses being analled
 
01:39:48.910 --> 01:39:48.920 align:start position:0%
improperly by passage of this type of
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you um representative
 
01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
new thank you Mr chair um I don't think
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
anybody will be surprised to say for me
 
01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
to say that I'm going to support this uh
 
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
OTP um but I just wanted to address I
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
agree with what representative wheeler
 
01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
and uh representative Murray said um
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
about kind of uh the process and how
 
01:40:10.470 --> 01:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
this works with the other bill I I think
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
there's a differentiation here in that
 
01:40:15.510 --> 01:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
what this bill aims to do is to rectify
 
01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
the past and we are uh when we talk
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
about um legalizing um cannabis we it's
 
01:40:24.669 --> 01:40:24.679 align:start position:0%
essentially we are all agreed on the
 
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
fact that we should it's just how we go
 
01:40:30.070 --> 01:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
about it what this bill does is say that
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh based on the premise that we
 
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
understand that part of the reason that
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
we are trying to legalize cannabis is
 
01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
that there is a uh that we have it has
 
01:40:41.229 --> 01:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
done um irreversible harm to people so
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
what this bill says is that on a base
 
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
level we understand that the uh the uh
 
01:40:49.709 --> 01:40:49.719 align:start position:0%
criminalization of cannabis has done
 
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
serious harm to people in our community
 
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
and this bill seeks to rectify the p
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
whereas the next one uh the other one
 
01:40:58.070 --> 01:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
the legalization moving forward um seeks
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
to rectify you know uh set things up for
 
01:41:01.629 --> 01:41:01.639 align:start position:0%
the future I hope I'm saying that
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
clearly the differentiation between the
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
two bills is that one sets us up for the
 
01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
future to to go forward in a good way
 
01:41:10.589 --> 01:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
this helps us um reconcile what we've
 
01:41:13.310 --> 01:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
done in the past and to um to write the
 
01:41:15.589 --> 01:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
wrongs that we've done in the past
 
01:41:18.990 --> 01:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
so representative s thank you chairman
 
01:41:22.669 --> 01:41:22.679 align:start position:0%
Roy um I I also support this bill um
 
01:41:25.550 --> 01:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
having previously worked in um real
 
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
estate and for a company that does
 
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
property management and knowing how many
 
01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
people end up not being eligible to get
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
rental housing because of past criminal
 
01:41:38.430 --> 01:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
records for something that in my mind
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
should not have been illegal in the
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
first place um to give people an easier
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
Avenue to get out of that so that it can
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
be easier for them to get housing and
 
01:41:47.709 --> 01:41:47.719 align:start position:0%
also get employment so they can be more
 
01:41:49.550 --> 01:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
productive members of society I think
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
excellent represent
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
read um I struggle with this bill
 
01:42:00.270 --> 01:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
because I honestly don't want people's
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
lives to be destroyed because of a weed
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
conviction um however I don't think
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
anybody's being arrested and sent to
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
jail for much of anything these days
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
especially for a joint so I think that
 
01:42:17.550 --> 01:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
they're being sent away for other things
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
besides this and um those who were
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
convicted or uh in the past for having
 
01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
marijuana it was illegal back then we so
 
01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
going forward we're we um marijuana
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
isn't legal yet anyway so this is like
 
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
putting the cart before the horse but
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
again I have to say I don't want
 
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
people's lives ruined for a weed
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
conviction but I don't know if this is
 
01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time yet thank
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
you further comments represent
 
01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:53.719 align:start position:0%
Muse yes part of the issue is I it is
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's not just a matter of people who may
 
01:43:01.830 --> 01:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
or may not uh are be going to jail uh as
 
01:43:04.990 --> 01:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
a result of an offense like this today I
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
think another huge issue is the fact
 
01:43:09.470 --> 01:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
that this is an offense that just
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
follows people um there are people I
 
01:43:15.550 --> 01:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
know who were arrested for possession in
 
01:43:18.030 --> 01:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
college uh who haven't been able to get
 
01:43:20.910 --> 01:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
jobs who've had trouble getting housing
 
01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh it's something that uh that can
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
affect your whole life I mean we look at
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
this now as a as a minor crime almost a
 
01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
violation level offense um you know we
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
barely prosecute people for under 3/4 of
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
an ounce of of cannabis now but it
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
hasn't always been like that and I think
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
until we change the law um so that we
 
01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
actually align it with with where we are
 
01:43:48.750 --> 01:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
today and where we seem to be today is
 
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
on the precipice of actually making it
 
01:43:54.030 --> 01:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
legal for the state of New Hampshire to
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
actually sell it to people so if we
 
01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
don't do something like this we would be
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
in a position as a state where we are
 
01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
actually selling cannabis uh to people
 
01:44:07.470 --> 01:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
and make bringing money into state
 
01:44:11.470 --> 01:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
coffers to to do that but uh we would
 
01:44:13.149 --> 01:44:13.159 align:start position:0%
have people who are still in a position
 
01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
where they have trouble getting jobs
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
trouble getting housing um and you know
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
whose lives really have been permanently
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
turned upside down because we're not
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
fixing something that I I think should
 
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:34.510 --> 01:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
point represent Stone thank you again
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go back that I heard no
 
01:44:37.589 --> 01:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
testimony or supporting facts or
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
circumstances that led that the analment
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
process we currently had had been
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
availed and then the individual was
 
01:44:45.589 --> 01:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
grieved by that process if we already
 
01:44:47.709 --> 01:44:47.719 align:start position:0%
have an analment process why isn't it
 
01:44:49.709 --> 01:44:49.719 align:start position:0%
being used for all these people who are
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
eligible to apply for inment and choose
 
01:44:57.070 --> 01:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.470 --> 01:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
sealed represent
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
Muse I think part of the reason for that
 
01:45:04.750 --> 01:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
is that um the analment process has a
 
01:45:09.149 --> 01:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
lot of built-in friction um it's
 
01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
difficult uh I think for the average
 
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
person who's affected by this to uh
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes I think to even know that an
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
enement process
 
01:45:21.629 --> 01:45:21.639 align:start position:0%
exists um it becomes something that uh I
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
think you can get as a matter of a a
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
privilege if you can afford an attorney
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
if you know what to do if you know what
 
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
strings to pull this is something that
 
01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
you can do but it's not something that's
 
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
really readily available to the average
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
person who's been convicted of an
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:42.709 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.109 --> 01:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
surely on the analment process you can
 
01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
find that on the judiciary's website and
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's approximately a $300 fee that you
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
do not need an attorney to file for you
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
are aware of
 
01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
that thank you um I think we can agree
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
that 300 bucks for some people can be
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
pricey um representative wheeler thank
 
01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh yes I I would say
 
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
that $300 can be pricey for some people
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
and also this bill is the automatic en
 
01:46:08.510 --> 01:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
nment statute so I would say that it's
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
the government kind of doing its job and
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
saying okay here are these people who
 
01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
have served out their sentence and now
 
01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
we can get them annuled um we don't have
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
statistics for New Hampshire in general
 
01:46:21.790 --> 01:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
but nationally it's about 5 to 6% of
 
01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
people who are eligible for an nments
 
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
get their crimes aned because they're as
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
representative Muse put quite well not
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
aware of the system they're they're the
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
average American who's not in in
 
01:46:34.870 --> 01:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
inundated with the criminal code and
 
01:46:36.109 --> 01:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't even know that it
 
01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
exists in a book form that they can read
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
and and you know I think that's most
 
01:46:42.669 --> 01:46:42.679 align:start position:0%
people who don't uh grasp the system
 
01:46:44.910 --> 01:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
that's around them um and that's why I
 
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
think it's important for sort of the
 
01:46:49.149 --> 01:46:49.159 align:start position:0%
government to do its job in writing this
 
01:46:51.390 --> 01:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
wrong and that's why that the automatic
 
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
analment statute was there um I respect
 
01:46:56.189 --> 01:46:56.199 align:start position:0%
uh everybody on this committee and
 
01:46:58.589 --> 01:46:58.599 align:start position:0%
representative Reed as well um the only
 
01:46:59.790 --> 01:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
thing that I'd have to say to you is I
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
think it's sometimes you got to build
 
01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
your cart so that you can travel down
 
01:47:05.229 --> 01:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
the road you know and so I don't want to
 
01:47:06.589 --> 01:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
put the cart before the horse but we
 
01:47:08.109 --> 01:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
don't even have a cart yet so I'd like
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
to build this cart so we can take people
 
01:47:12.070 --> 01:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
down the road here so we can make sure
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
that they have a a solid thing so I
 
01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
totally I don't you know vote however
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
you feel you need to vote but I do I do
 
01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
think um that this is a bill that's
 
01:47:22.990 --> 01:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
separate from legalization you know what
 
01:47:24.669 --> 01:47:24.679 align:start position:0%
however you feel about legalization this
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
is about sort of as representative Muse
 
01:47:28.990 --> 01:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
put quite well people's livelihoods so
 
01:47:30.669 --> 01:47:30.679 align:start position:0%
that's the last thing I'll have to say
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for this
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
discussion and thank you for using a
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
cart instead of a Magic Bus analogy
 
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
um representative Harry GTH thank you Mr
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
chair but actually that's exactly what I
 
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
was going to talk about the fact that
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
this um if you look at line four and
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
five this is truly about you know
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
automatic annoing so he did a a
 
01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
excellent job in explaining that so I
 
01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
don't need to go any further and I will
 
01:48:00.109 --> 01:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
be supporting thank you okay I think
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
we've um we've had just about enough
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
discussion on this one um I I'll close
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
by saying I I like representative Reed
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
am torn on this bill um however one
 
01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
thing um as as it pains me to say
 
01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative M's argument made um made
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
me think um how hypocritical that we're
 
01:48:22.510 --> 01:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
contemplating selling this product and
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
people people have a criminal record for
 
01:48:26.669 --> 01:48:26.679 align:start position:0%
possessing the product that we're about
 
01:48:29.310 --> 01:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
to sell um I I don't think I can that
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't set well with me so I'm I'm
 
01:48:34.589 --> 01:48:34.599 align:start position:0%
probably going to support this and um if
 
01:48:36.430 --> 01:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
it passes on the floor and let the
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
Senate deal with it how they deal with
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
the other Bill and in their wisdom maybe
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
combine these to somehow come up with
 
01:48:46.870 --> 01:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
something that's proper but I just don't
 
01:48:49.390 --> 01:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
um that bothers
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
me representative Newman and I just want
 
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
to follow on with your comment I mean we
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
haven't decriminalized many other crimes
 
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
at all this is a unique situation where
 
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
we decriminalize something where people
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
have a record and so it's different than
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
than the other crimes that are out there
 
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
and I support the automatic uh
 
01:49:13.149 --> 01:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
solution um to be clear just to go on
 
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
record I'm not a supporter of
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
legalization at all but I'm a supporter
 
01:49:20.189 --> 01:49:20.199 align:start position:0%
of common sense in law and whether we're
 
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
talking about marijuana or widgets if
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
the government selling widgets and
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
someone has a record for possessing
 
01:49:30.350 --> 01:49:30.360 align:start position:0%
widgets to me that that's that's that's
 
01:49:33.870 --> 01:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
not um that's not right but say I will
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
disassociate myself from your previous
 
01:49:38.830 --> 01:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
comment no problem um representative

introduce an
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
amendment and the amendment number is
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:03:52.990 --> 02:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
011h can I have a second
 
02:03:54.549 --> 02:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
second by represent
 
02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
Stone I'll speak to the amendment this I
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
really don't have much recollection of
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
this bill other than the fact that I
 
02:04:02.390 --> 02:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
apparently got an amendment for it and
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
I'll read it Reckless operation of boats
 
02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
any person who shall operate a power
 
02:04:09.390 --> 02:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
boat are you guys okay over there no
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
we're not M Mr chairman representative G
 
02:04:16.189 --> 02:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
did we already except this Bill yes
 
02:04:18.189 --> 02:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
confused on January 19th that might be
 
02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
why I have no recollection we're all set
 
02:04:24.030 --> 02:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
it passed pass as amend it so it so it's
 
02:04:25.950 --> 02:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
on I think it's on our list is this
 
02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
Groundhog Day no no no no no no because
 
02:04:31.229 --> 02:04:31.239 align:start position:0%
remember or if I remember correctly um
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
we had to recess it because we had to
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
fix the do we already know this am I
 
02:04:37.910 --> 02:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
repeating people because we had to fix
 
02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
the the fact that it was in both
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
statutes it said I mean both uh sections
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
that said the same thing we and then we
 
02:04:46.189 --> 02:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
recessed it so that we could have an
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
amendment that that fixed it and we did
 
02:04:51.310 --> 02:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
get it so the amendment number is 0111 H
 
02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
I believe this is the am that's been
 
02:04:57.510 --> 02:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
handed on January 19th okay we did 0111
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
H2 to0 then we did ought to pass 20 to
 
02:05:04.750 --> 02:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
zero so I don't know what all right
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
we're gonna this was put on here by IR I
 
02:05:11.310 --> 02:05:11.320 align:start position:0%
no no I'm not redoing it I spoke to um
 
02:05:13.750 --> 02:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
our assistant and she's the one who gave
 
02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
us this to go on the agenda so I'm going
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
to recess this non-existent bill for a
 
02:05:22.669 --> 02:05:22.679 align:start position:0%
minute could you ask Karen do you mind
 
02:05:23.950 --> 02:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thanks and in the
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
meantime we'll take up something much
 
02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
less controversial I open the executive
 
02:05:32.270 --> 02:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:36.189 --> 02:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
1711 and I make a motion of ought to
 
02:05:39.790 --> 02:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
pass second who second and that
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative here I gu right oh
 
02:05:44.669 --> 02:05:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to uh I'll speak to my
 
02:05:50.790 --> 02:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
amendment I mean to my bill so this is a
 
02:05:52.229 --> 02:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
really really difficult
 
02:05:54.910 --> 02:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
bill but at the end of the day it comes
 
02:05:56.910 --> 02:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
down to a simple
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
concept um as all of you know I am one
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
of the staunchest Second Amendment
 
02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
defenders in the
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
house that being said I cannot with a
 
02:06:08.669 --> 02:06:08.679 align:start position:0%
straight face tell someone that someone
 
02:06:11.510 --> 02:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
who is dangerously mentally ill should
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
be able to walk into a gun store and
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
purchase a
 
02:06:17.310 --> 02:06:17.320 align:start position:0%
firearm someone who hears voices telling
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
them to do things someone who who has
 
02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
these dangerous
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
inclinations and has been found so by a
 
02:06:28.750 --> 02:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist and a court with an
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
attorney at a
 
02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
hearing that's the person I'm talking
 
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
about I don't know how I could tell the
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
family of Chief ha or any of my
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
constituents I think it's okay that they
 
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
can buy guns now I understand
 
02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
that anytime you seed power to the
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
federal government it's a very dangerous
 
02:06:52.109 --> 02:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
thing that being said
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
the federal law is already in place once
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
you have been
 
02:06:55.679 --> 02:06:57.310 align:start position:0%
you have been
adjudicated

02:06:57.310 --> 02:06:57.320 align:start position:0%
adjudicated
 
02:06:59.310 --> 02:06:59.320 align:start position:0%
dangerously mentally
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
ill and committed and that's what this
 
02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
bill is about people who are committed
 
02:07:05.229 --> 02:07:05.239 align:start position:0%
for the most
 
02:07:08.069 --> 02:07:08.079 align:start position:0%
part you're automatically a prohibited
 
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
person whether you know it or not or
 
02:07:11.950 --> 02:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
whether the state informs the federal
 
02:07:13.950 --> 02:07:13.960 align:start position:0%
government or not if you're arrested and
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
you have a firearm you are subject to be
 
02:07:19.390 --> 02:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for a 10-year federal
 
02:07:22.750 --> 02:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
felony so there's that aspect of it the
 
02:07:25.709 --> 02:07:25.719 align:start position:0%
second aspect of it is this right now
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
anyone in this room could go see their
 
02:07:29.709 --> 02:07:29.719 align:start position:0%
therapist tonight and tell their
 
02:07:31.470 --> 02:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
therapist you know I'm so mad at my
 
02:07:33.709 --> 02:07:33.719 align:start position:0%
spouse I could kill them if they think
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
that you might be serious they can
 
02:07:37.350 --> 02:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
report you to
 
02:07:41.069 --> 02:07:41.079 align:start position:0%
Nyx and there you are you're on nck
 
02:07:43.149 --> 02:07:43.159 align:start position:0%
you're on the list and guess what you
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
can never get off ever there's no
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
process in New Hampshire for the
 
02:07:50.030 --> 02:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
restoration of
 
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
Rights for for the federal government to
 
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
take your name off of Nicks your state
 
02:08:00.510 --> 02:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
has to have an approved approved rest of
 
02:08:02.229 --> 02:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
restoration of Rights
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
statute that means you write a bill it
 
02:08:07.589 --> 02:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
passes in law the ATF looks at it it
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
meets their criteria they say it's
 
02:08:11.629 --> 02:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
approved now you can get your name off
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
the list New Hampshire has no such
 
02:08:16.149 --> 02:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
statute so anyone on the list right now
 
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire is there for the rest
 
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
of their
 
02:08:21.229 --> 02:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
life so at the same time we have people
 
02:08:23.910 --> 02:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
who are dangerous being able to purchase
 
02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
firearms in Hampshire and we have people
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
who may no longer be dangerous unable to
 
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
get their name off the list so that they
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
can purchase
 
02:08:34.629 --> 02:08:34.639 align:start position:0%
firearms so what this bill
 
02:08:38.149 --> 02:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
does it makes a very narrow process to
 
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
have someone's name sent to the federal
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
government and it gives them a way to
 
02:08:47.629 --> 02:08:47.639 align:start position:0%
get back off that list I also due to
 
02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
lack of trust with things at the federal
 
02:08:52.830 --> 02:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
government level sometimes put in there
 
02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
that this law cannot take effect until
 
02:08:59.069 --> 02:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
after the ATF approves our restoration
 
02:09:01.109 --> 02:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
process that means if there's no way to
 
02:09:03.149 --> 02:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
get your name off the list your name
 
02:09:06.030 --> 02:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
can't go on the list so I took every
 
02:09:08.270 --> 02:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
step I possibly could to make sure that
 
02:09:10.350 --> 02:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
people's rights were protected and that
 
02:09:12.030 --> 02:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
only the people who are dangerously
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
mentally ill and having been a judged so
 
02:09:18.669 --> 02:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
by the court with a representative a
 
02:09:20.669 --> 02:09:20.679 align:start position:0%
lawyer and if they couldn't afford what
 
02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
want is prevent uh provided for them
 
02:09:25.629 --> 02:09:25.639 align:start position:0%
would be put on this list only people
 
02:09:28.149 --> 02:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
that were already prohibited by federal
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
law from possessing a firearm are going
 
02:09:34.830 --> 02:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
on this list and even they it's only
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
temporary and if they get better and
 
02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:39.320 align:start position:0%
they have their treatment they can get
 
02:09:43.709 --> 02:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
off the list so with that um I have
 
02:09:46.270 --> 02:09:46.280 align:start position:0%
nothing further to add representative PR
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:53.549 --> 02:09:53.559 align:start position:0%
second I do uh
 
02:09:57.030 --> 02:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
so I agree this is not the perfect bill
 
02:10:00.549 --> 02:10:00.559 align:start position:0%
but it does uh head in the right
 
02:10:04.470 --> 02:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
direction uh people who are seriously
 
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
ill uh need not be able to have access
 
02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:09.310 align:start position:0%
ill uh need not be able to have access
to

02:10:09.310 --> 02:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
firearms and I also like that we're
 
02:10:19.229 --> 02:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
putting in restoration of Rights so
 
02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
um if it's a misunderstand standing with
 
02:10:23.870 --> 02:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
your therapists you get better right
 
02:10:26.069 --> 02:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
because we all know that the end goal of
 
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
of therapy
 
02:10:31.870 --> 02:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
and and mental health medicine is to get
 
02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
you better get make you stronger um and
 
02:10:37.669 --> 02:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of times it's
 
02:10:41.310 --> 02:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
just uh one issue that you work through
 
02:10:43.310 --> 02:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
and and you're come out the other side
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
in a way better place than you went in
 
02:10:49.589 --> 02:10:49.599 align:start position:0%
so um to be able to get off that list
 
02:10:52.229 --> 02:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
after you um
 
02:10:52.239 --> 02:10:53.149 align:start position:0%
after you um
gotten

02:10:53.149 --> 02:10:53.159 align:start position:0%
gotten
 
02:10:57.549 --> 02:10:57.559 align:start position:0%
better is significant I think so um I'm
 
02:10:59.109 --> 02:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
going to vote for
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative rhods
 
02:11:05.549 --> 02:11:05.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman if if you one of
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
the things you did not touch base on
 
02:11:08.910 --> 02:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
that I think would be
 
02:11:12.109 --> 02:11:12.119 align:start position:0%
helpful is an example of where a red
 
02:11:15.149 --> 02:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
flag lot is different is an example if
 
02:11:17.870 --> 02:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
if somebody were to call up and say you
 
02:11:22.270 --> 02:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
know say it's a an ugly divorce and
 
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
and there's an accusation made where a
 
02:11:27.310 --> 02:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
red flag law would be different than the
 
02:11:29.069 --> 02:11:29.079 align:start position:0%
situation that is here if you could
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
maybe talk about that for just a second
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
address that sure red well depending on
 
02:11:36.189 --> 02:11:36.199 align:start position:0%
which red flag ball um generally
 
02:11:39.229 --> 02:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
speaking Heros um those laws what they
 
02:11:41.310 --> 02:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
do is they allow someone close to you a
 
02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
family member friend neighbor to be able
 
02:11:45.149 --> 02:11:45.159 align:start position:0%
to go to law enforcement and say that I
 
02:11:46.589 --> 02:11:46.599 align:start position:0%
have serious concerns about this
 
02:11:49.390 --> 02:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
person's mental health at which point
 
02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
they can issue the the police can get
 
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
what's called an erpo emergency order to
 
02:11:56.390 --> 02:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
pull your Firearms it kind of flips the
 
02:11:58.350 --> 02:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
script in other words it makes you have
 
02:12:01.310 --> 02:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
to prove your sane versus the state
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
having to prove that you're not sane um
 
02:12:06.310 --> 02:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
whereas this law that's revers the state
 
02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
has to prove that you are dangerously
 
02:12:10.430 --> 02:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
mentally ill instead of you proving
 
02:12:12.629 --> 02:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
you're not so that's one of the key
 
02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
things and second thing is not everyone
 
02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
can just go in and apply for you to be
 
02:12:20.549 --> 02:12:20.559 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed it takes um I
 
02:12:22.350 --> 02:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
think it takes people I mean it's very
 
02:12:24.109 --> 02:12:24.119 align:start position:0%
complex to get somebody committed in a
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
state it's not easy and someone off the
 
02:12:28.270 --> 02:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
street who doesn't like your politics
 
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
can't just go in and say I think that
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
person should be involuntarily committed
 
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a much much different
 
02:12:37.390 --> 02:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
standard between the two and I would add
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
that as far as proun States it's
 
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
difficult to think of two more proun
 
02:12:46.350 --> 02:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
States than Florida and Texas and both
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
of them have this exact law
 
02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:49.910 align:start position:0%
of them have this exact law
representative

02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
Newman would you just clarify your
 
02:12:54.589 --> 02:12:54.599 align:start position:0%
motion was ought to pass or ought to
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
pass as amended there is no Amendment
 
02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
associated with this okay so previous
 
02:13:09.709 --> 02:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:13.589 --> 02:13:13.599 align:start position:0%
you um represent
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
Muse I just wanted to briefly uh speak
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
to the amendment because I believe we
 
02:13:19.629 --> 02:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
have to vote on the amendment first uh
 
02:13:20.910 --> 02:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
representative Newman just said that and
 
02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
I I you'll have to excuse me I I have an
 
02:13:26.189 --> 02:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
amendment and it's for this bill I just
 
02:13:27.709 --> 02:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
whose amendment is it
 
02:13:30.750 --> 02:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
mine it was a February Amendment and it
 
02:13:33.470 --> 02:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
was you we have an amendment dated
 
02:13:35.310 --> 02:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
February was it was entered that day at
 
02:13:37.750 --> 02:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
the hearing when I was gone I don't know
 
02:13:41.669 --> 02:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
entered I thought it was entered while I
 
02:13:48.239 --> 02:13:50.030 align:start position:0%
entered I thought it was entered while I
was

02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:59.470 align:start position:0%
was
gone

02:13:59.470 --> 02:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
this was the amendment uh representative
 
02:14:05.310 --> 02:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
Roy that um the uh disability rights
 
02:14:09.310 --> 02:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
Center uh proposed uh and it has some
 
02:14:11.350 --> 02:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
pretty significant changes that I think
 
02:14:13.510 --> 02:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
are probably changes we would all agree
 
02:14:16.270 --> 02:14:16.280 align:start position:0%
to um yeah I recall it and I thought
 
02:14:17.870 --> 02:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
that it was introduced already that day
 
02:14:19.390 --> 02:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
that I left and the hearing continued
 
02:14:22.149 --> 02:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
because I had to leave so we will um we
 
02:14:24.149 --> 02:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
will introduce the amendment so I
 
02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
believe my motion was out to pass I need
 
02:14:27.669 --> 02:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
to withdraw that motion we need to
 
02:14:30.510 --> 02:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
introduce the amendment um
 
02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative approve thank you the
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
Motions are withdrawn I recognize
 
02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:45.109 --> 02:14:45.119 align:start position:0%
motion I move to uh pass uh uh HB
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
17711 with Amendment 2024
 
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
0431 H I second that would you like to
 
02:14:56.510 --> 02:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
speak to that Amendment
 
02:14:59.549 --> 02:14:59.559 align:start position:0%
please one of the I think one of the
 
02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
main objectives we've had throughout
 
02:15:02.990 --> 02:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
this process is to make sure that
 
02:15:05.189 --> 02:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
whatever we do doesn't further victimize
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
and stigmatized people um who are
 
02:15:09.549 --> 02:15:09.559 align:start position:0%
already victimized and stigmatized
 
02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
enough and and those are people with
 
02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
with mental illness uh while it's
 
02:15:16.950 --> 02:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical to close um a
 
02:15:19.790 --> 02:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
critical Public Safety vulnerability I
 
02:15:21.149 --> 02:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
think one of the things we've tried to
 
02:15:23.709 --> 02:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
do every step of the way is to consult
 
02:15:25.069 --> 02:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
with people in the Mental Health
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
Community in the disability community
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
and even with some of the the folks who
 
02:15:32.549 --> 02:15:32.559 align:start position:0%
work at New Hampshire hospital on what
 
02:15:34.109 --> 02:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
this bill should look like and how it
 
02:15:36.669 --> 02:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
should take shape so as part of that
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
process uh Karen Rosenberg who is the
 
02:15:41.229 --> 02:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
policy director for the disability
 
02:15:43.549 --> 02:15:43.559 align:start position:0%
rights Center uh noticed some things in
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
the bill uh that she suggested fixing
 
02:15:50.270 --> 02:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
that would make make it um uh
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
essentially easy easier for her
 
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
organization to sign on and and I'll
 
02:15:56.709 --> 02:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
just review some of those things very
 
02:15:56.719 --> 02:15:57.510 align:start position:0%
just review some of those things very
very

02:15:57.510 --> 02:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:15:59.910 --> 02:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
quickly um one of the things the
 
02:16:02.109 --> 02:16:02.119 align:start position:0%
amendment does is it requires judges to
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
inform um uh the person um who's under a
 
02:16:10.109 --> 02:16:10.119 align:start position:0%
judication uh that uh a seizure is a
 
02:16:12.189 --> 02:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
possible outcome and it makes them aware
 
02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
that they can request a hearing on
 
02:16:16.669 --> 02:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
involuntary commitment and they can also
 
02:16:18.910 --> 02:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
make other arrangements to turn in their
 
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
firearms rather than Simply Having
 
02:16:23.629 --> 02:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh a law enforcement officer confiscate
 
02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
the Firearms another thing that it does
 
02:16:29.310 --> 02:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
is it reduces the time frame for the
 
02:16:32.669 --> 02:16:32.679 align:start position:0%
process um that guns would be returned
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh to someone who's proven that they're
 
02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
no longer a danger to themselves to
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
others uh the original Bill uh had uh
 
02:16:43.389 --> 02:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
had a six-month time frame for that to
 
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
happen the amendment reduces that to 60
 
02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:48.589 align:start position:0%
happen the amendment reduces that to 60
days

02:16:48.589 --> 02:16:48.599 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:16:51.469 --> 02:16:51.479 align:start position:0%
um the uh the amend
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
uh also uh restricts some of the sharing
 
02:16:58.990 --> 02:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
of of personal information so uh the
 
02:17:01.070 --> 02:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
original language basically said that
 
02:17:04.230 --> 02:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
any non-clinical identifying information
 
02:17:06.990 --> 02:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh could be shared what the amendment
 
02:17:08.910 --> 02:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
does is it restricts the sharing of
 
02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:10.110 align:start position:0%
does is it restricts the sharing of
personal

02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
personal
 
02:17:12.589 --> 02:17:12.599 align:start position:0%
information simply to the information
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's needed to get somebody's name up
 
02:17:16.910 --> 02:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
on the system so that would be their
 
02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
name um it would be the applicable uh
 
02:17:21.870 --> 02:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
prohibition it would be their date of
 
02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
birth and their social security number
 
02:17:27.790 --> 02:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
so no clinical information of any kind
 
02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh is actually being shared uh with the
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
FBI or any anyone in the federal
 
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
government uh that information is
 
02:17:35.790 --> 02:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
retained uh in the New Hampshire
 
02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:38.349 align:start position:0%
retained uh in the New Hampshire
judicial

02:17:38.349 --> 02:17:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
system thank you representative Muse and
 
02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Newman for
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
bringing that to my attention I was
 
02:17:46.790 --> 02:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
absent the day this um bill was brought
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
forward so I thought I left the
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
amendment I thought it had been adopted
 
02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
cuz as you as you may have noticed in my
 
02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
in my discussion I mentioned some things
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
that were already in here so um having
 
02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
said that further discussion on the bill
 
02:18:03.150 --> 02:18:03.160 align:start position:0%
and the underlying Amendment we didn't
 
02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:05.709 align:start position:0%
and the underlying Amendment we didn't
discuss

02:18:05.709 --> 02:18:05.719 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
02:18:08.830 --> 02:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Stone yeah on the
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
bill itself uh I support it about 90%
 
02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
And with that being said I'm going to
 
02:18:16.469 --> 02:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
support uh making a motion excuse me not
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
a motion but I'll be voting in a yes to
 
02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
send it to the house floor with one of
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
the aspects of this bill that it really
 
02:18:24.830 --> 02:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh stands out to me is the process of
 
02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
duw process that both removing firearm
 
02:18:29.669 --> 02:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
rights and reinstating fire Mar which is
 
02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
crucial an individual should not have uh
 
02:18:33.190 --> 02:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
due process stripped from either
 
02:18:34.349 --> 02:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
direction whether it be in the beginning
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
or the end uh this bill does rectify
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
that in addition a judicial process is
 
02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
involving an attorney that is there to
 
02:18:45.709 --> 02:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
represent a individual uh the attorney
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
will safeguard their rights as well
 
02:18:49.389 --> 02:18:49.399 align:start position:0%
during the hearing process the judge
 
02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
will make the final determination it's
 
02:18:54.150 --> 02:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
not just a psychological or medical
 
02:18:56.309 --> 02:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
issue that's brought up so the due
 
02:18:58.750 --> 02:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
process provided by a hearing is
 
02:19:01.030 --> 02:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
instrumental in providing individuals
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
rights and that's uh the best takeaway I
 
02:19:07.549 --> 02:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
have of this Bill thank you I would um I
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
would call everyone's attention to the
 
02:19:12.230 --> 02:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
fact that um in 2016 representative Hull
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
introduced a bill that became law as
 
02:19:16.750 --> 02:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
part of the Medicaid bill that
 
02:19:18.270 --> 02:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
specifically said no one shall have
 
02:19:20.070 --> 02:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
their firearms taken away by reason of
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
mental health ISS issues unless they
 
02:19:24.429 --> 02:19:24.439 align:start position:0%
have a hearing before court and they
 
02:19:25.669 --> 02:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
have an attorney
 
02:19:28.270 --> 02:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
present um which is basically what this
 
02:19:30.030 --> 02:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
does except it also gives you a way to
 
02:19:35.469 --> 02:19:35.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:38.509 --> 02:19:38.519 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um thank you Mr
 
02:19:40.990 --> 02:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
chair committee um I I support the bill
 
02:19:42.750 --> 02:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
and the amendment I used to live in a
 
02:19:44.709 --> 02:19:44.719 align:start position:0%
community where we had an Indigent
 
02:19:47.230 --> 02:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
person who suffered from a recurrent
 
02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
mental health illness and he would get
 
02:19:51.670 --> 02:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
hospitalized he would get stabilized
 
02:19:54.270 --> 02:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
with medication once he was stable for
 
02:19:55.950 --> 02:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
two weeks they would release him because
 
02:19:58.270 --> 02:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
that was as much coverage as he had for
 
02:20:00.670 --> 02:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
insurance um he would then cease taking
 
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
his medications and we'd go through the
 
02:20:05.110 --> 02:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
cycle over and over again until he each
 
02:20:07.389 --> 02:20:07.399 align:start position:0%
time got to the point of attempting to
 
02:20:09.630 --> 02:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
break into a business or do some other
 
02:20:12.030 --> 02:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
kind of thing that frightened people and
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
then would end up back in the hospital
 
02:20:17.950 --> 02:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
back being involuntarily you know um
 
02:20:19.710 --> 02:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
committed and and he's the kind of
 
02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
person who this addresses right he
 
02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:25.160 align:start position:0%
should not he was not able to maintain
 
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
stability in a way that kept him safe to
 
02:20:28.990 --> 02:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
be in society and because we don't have
 
02:20:30.750 --> 02:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
a structure to provide him the type of
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
life support or overall life support I
 
02:20:34.750 --> 02:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
don't mean like breathing but
 
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
functioning support um in our society as
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
as it exists right now he would not have
 
02:20:41.110 --> 02:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
been someone who would have been safe to
 
02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
have a firearm because we would never no
 
02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
one would have ever known when the
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
voices were telling him to do things so
 
02:20:47.270 --> 02:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good bill I think it's
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
essential that we work to protect people
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
and and that we have a process to
 
02:20:52.349 --> 02:20:52.359 align:start position:0%
protect all of
 
02:20:56.110 --> 02:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
them thank you further

objection to
 
02:22:58.030 --> 02:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
consent seeing none it will go on
 
02:23:00.510 --> 02:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
consent and I close the executive
 
02:23:02.750 --> 02:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
session now I'm opening the executive
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
session on that
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
last apparently I was right in the first
 
02:23:09.710 --> 02:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
place on hb1
 
02:23:12.429 --> 02:23:12.439 align:start position:0%
1366 about crazy boat drivers where are
 
02:23:12.439 --> 02:23:13.590 align:start position:0%
1366 about crazy boat drivers where are
we

02:23:13.590 --> 02:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:23:16.670 --> 02:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
at Mr chairman it appears that we are
 
02:23:19.230 --> 02:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
all a little bit right and wrong uh so
 
02:23:21.710 --> 02:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
we did vote on this bill and we did pass
 
02:23:24.110 --> 02:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
it um on the consent I believe was 20 to
 
02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
zero with an amendment and we if my
 
02:23:30.030 --> 02:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
understanding is if my memory is correct
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
we actually made a motion to re I think
 
02:23:35.349 --> 02:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
we like withdrew the motion because
 
02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
there was I believe something with an
 
02:23:39.309 --> 02:23:39.319 align:start position:0%
amendment and representative n seems to
 
02:23:41.830 --> 02:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
have a better memory exactly but I do
 
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
know on my list I crossed it off so I
 
02:23:46.910 --> 02:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
know it was taken
 
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
back uh our lovely assistant has um
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
informed me that exactly what I just
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
said we had the we did vote on it and
 
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
then I crossed it off so we turned it in
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
knowing we were going to come back to it
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
today but I don't remember the reason
 
02:24:02.790 --> 02:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
but representative n seems to if you
 
02:24:10.630 --> 02:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
I um I apologize I don't have the bill
 
02:24:14.190 --> 02:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
in front of me right now so I'm just
 
02:24:16.469 --> 02:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
going to give there was an A and A B and
 
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
we had an amendment to separate the A
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
and B because uh they were different
 
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
levels of offense right so um but when
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
we separated it out we didn't change the
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
language in a way that comported with
 
02:24:28.110 --> 02:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
those being two different things so
 
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
there was one one phrase that was
 
02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
repeated in both that really needed to
 
02:24:34.510 --> 02:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
just be in one and I'm sorry it's not
 
02:24:35.710 --> 02:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
specific because I don't have it in
 
02:24:36.990 --> 02:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
front of me if anybody does I can tell
 
02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:49.309 align:start position:0%
front of me if anybody does I can tell
you

02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:52.429 --> 02:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
exactly okay we're trying really hard
 
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
not to have too many people
 
02:24:59.870 --> 02:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
talking it was the or no no no no no
 
02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
so in the amendment it was in a reckless
 
02:25:07.269 --> 02:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
manner or so that the lives and safety
 
02:25:08.670 --> 02:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
of the public are endangered I think we
 
02:25:11.309 --> 02:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
were supposed to get rid of the or uh I
 
02:25:12.990 --> 02:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
can't find it my notes but whoever spoke
 
02:25:15.070 --> 02:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
about it wasn't recommending the war in
 
02:25:17.910 --> 02:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
between those it it was our um there was
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
a sub from Judiciary who had been the
 
02:25:24.429 --> 02:25:24.439 align:start position:0%
both of them both of both A and B oh he
 
02:25:26.309 --> 02:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
was very explicit that the way that it
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
was written made it unclear would make
 
02:25:31.349 --> 02:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
it unclear for a Justice to know what
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
the full intent was and that we needed
 
02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
to remove the word or in order to have
 
02:25:40.190 --> 02:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
it correct and I I am sorry that I've
 
02:25:43.269 --> 02:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
lost his name in my memory moment
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
actually he is the former Chief Justice
 
02:25:47.590 --> 02:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
of En Hampshire Supreme Court
 
02:25:50.830 --> 02:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
um so it's because having that
 
02:25:53.150 --> 02:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
phrase so that the latter that that the
 
02:25:54.750 --> 02:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
lives and safety of the public are
 
02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
endangered having that phrase in both A
 
02:26:00.910 --> 02:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
and B uh make it so that those are
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
equivalent so it's it's hard to parse
 
02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
out so we needed to take it out of one
 
02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.110 align:start position:0%
out so we needed to take it out of one
of

02:26:06.110 --> 02:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:26:08.790 --> 02:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
them and I have an amendment in front of
 
02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:09.710 align:start position:0%
them and I have an amendment in front of
me

02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:26:12.030 --> 02:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
011h and I'm not sure if that does that
 
02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:26:22.429 --> 02:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
we we reest it so that it could be sent
 
02:26:24.269 --> 02:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
back to have the or removed and we
 
02:26:26.349 --> 02:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
forgot yeah so we do not have the
 
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
correct amendment that does today so
 
02:26:31.469 --> 02:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
okay um first of all just anyone
 
02:26:33.150 --> 02:26:33.160 align:start position:0%
watching at home we are not normally
 
02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:34.190 align:start position:0%
watching at home we are not normally
this

02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:26:36.830 --> 02:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
messy the the
 
02:26:38.990 --> 02:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
Senate the Senate held a hearing on one
 
02:26:41.790 --> 02:26:41.800 align:start position:0%
of our most important bills this morning
 
02:26:43.830 --> 02:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
and um it really kind of threw a wrench
 
02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
into our structure um yeah so having
 
02:26:50.830 --> 02:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
said that we are up against the deadline
 
02:26:55.469 --> 02:26:55.479 align:start position:0%
on this bill um so I recommend that we
 
02:26:58.110 --> 02:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
vote on to passw with Amendment as it is
 
02:27:00.309 --> 02:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
and we can fix it with a floor Amendment
 
02:27:02.469 --> 02:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
AB um just so that we have it off our
 
02:27:04.870 --> 02:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
table at this point represent Murray did
 
02:27:06.870 --> 02:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
we when we recessed it did we not
 
02:27:09.950 --> 02:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
already land on OTP did we not already
 
02:27:12.389 --> 02:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
vote on that I think we did and but
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
maybe we didn't transmit it to the clerk
 
02:27:17.469 --> 02:27:17.479 align:start position:0%
correct so if we've already voted I'm
 
02:27:18.790 --> 02:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
just going to say transmited and we're
 
02:27:23.230 --> 02:27:23.240 align:start position:0%
done yeah if we voted okay hold on the
 
02:27:47.950 --> 02:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:49.630 --> 02:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
approaching okay what we're going to do
 
02:27:51.030 --> 02:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
is we're going to call the role in O
 
02:27:52.469 --> 02:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
passes amended we're pretty sure it went
 
02:27:54.750 --> 02:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
20 to Zer but we can't be sure so we're
 
02:27:56.670 --> 02:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
going to do a belt in suspenders so I'd
 
02:27:58.190 --> 02:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the role of O
 
02:28:00.190 --> 02:28:00.200 align:start position:0%
passw with Amendment on this bill just
 
02:28:03.469 --> 02:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
to cover us and um we will look at
 
02:28:04.990 --> 02:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
fixing it on the
 
02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
floor so representative Roy you had made
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
the motion of ought to pass so we'll
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
just go with that okay ought to pass
 
02:28:16.670 --> 02:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
yeah with Amendment yeah second it
 
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.120 align:start position:0%

02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
recognize representative rhods to make a
 
02:31:26.030 --> 02:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman I move out
 
02:31:30.830 --> 02:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:34.510 --> 02:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
1046 priority okay would you like to
 
02:31:36.389 --> 02:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion thank you Mr
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
chairman uh so
 
02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
basically this morning we had basically
 
02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
heard um that it's there there appears
 
02:31:45.990 --> 02:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
there are some situations where people
 
02:31:49.030 --> 02:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
possibly could be renting uh Motorcraft
 
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
and if they're they may be involved in
 
02:31:53.630 --> 02:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
an accident they're turning the boats
 
02:31:55.950 --> 02:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
back in um there may be an aggrieved
 
02:31:59.389 --> 02:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
party but there isn't anything um Coming
 
02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
forward to say so basically the person
 
02:32:03.230 --> 02:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
runs the boat and leaves and it's very
 
02:32:04.670 --> 02:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
obvious that the that there has been
 
02:32:07.309 --> 02:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
damage done and nobody wants to say
 
02:32:08.830 --> 02:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
anything about it so this actually does
 
02:32:10.110 --> 02:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
put a threshold of
 
02:32:12.349 --> 02:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
$2,000 um and it also clearly says
 
02:32:14.469 --> 02:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
reasonably or reasonably should have
 
02:32:17.389 --> 02:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
known um and he was very much able to
 
02:32:20.110 --> 02:32:20.120 align:start position:0%
explain what should have known actually
 
02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
could mean um I had given an example of
 
02:32:25.630 --> 02:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
a boating accident that I was in a while
 
02:32:28.110 --> 02:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
AG years ago that kind of explained what
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
this kind was about and there was only a
 
02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
couple questions and I I think it was
 
02:32:33.710 --> 02:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
very very much straightforward there's
 
02:32:36.550 --> 02:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
really nothing bad about this at
 
02:32:38.910 --> 02:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
all that was a word solid but you get
 
02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak this a second
 
02:32:42.790 --> 02:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
represent Pro sure I I think it just put
 
02:32:45.269 --> 02:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
some responsibility you know like you
 
02:32:47.230 --> 02:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
would have in a in automobile you get in
 
02:32:48.990 --> 02:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
a car accident and you have to report it
 
02:32:50.510 --> 02:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
and now they just say if you're in a
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
boat accident more than $2,000
 
02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
damage anything it touched you have to
 
02:32:59.510 --> 02:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
report it so that's common
 
02:33:02.910 --> 02:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
sense further
 
02:33:05.389 --> 02:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
