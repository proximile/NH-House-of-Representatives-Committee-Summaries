meeting which we have of the legislative
 
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
oversight committee for improvement and
 
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
assessment of our our program here in uh
 
00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
education um I want to uh just reinforce
 
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
what we're we're doing today uh in the
 
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
calendar it's noted that this is a
 
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
meeting specifically for the Improvement
 
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
and assessment oversight uh committee
 
00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 align:start position:0%
which we have which is comprised of
 
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
folks from the Senate and in the house
 
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 align:start position:0%
um we also have been directed by both
 
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
leadership on the minority side and the
 
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
majority side of the house to have a
 
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
committee in each policy committee a
 
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which reviews proposed
 
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
rules and makes recommendations to our
 
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
Jael car committee and so those folks
 
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
and we we kind of duplicate ourselves on
 
00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
this committee that we're we're on both
 
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
so we will be doing both tasks at the
 
00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 align:start position:0%
same time here and so we do have an
 
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
agenda for today I have
 
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh one copy right here but I also have
 
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
several other copies it's a very simple
 
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
agenda in terms of the first portion we
 
00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 align:start position:0%
have three or four components here the
 
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
first component is what are the duties
 
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee and the
 
00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of this committee and
 
00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
the second uh part is dealing with the
 
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
proposed Ed 306 administrative rules for
 
00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
education and we have a letter which I
 
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
wrote to the commissioner and the
 
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner has willingly and happily
 
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
come forward to the committee to present
 
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
where we are on those rules as of this
 
00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 align:start position:0%
point in the process and that's part of
 
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
the presentation he will be doing
 
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
following that there will be a a portion
 
00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
of her time used for uh question answers
 
00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 align:start position:0%
uh between the commissioner and members
 
00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 align:start position:0%
on this committee right here on this
 
00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
panel so with that I'd like to go ahead
 
00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 align:start position:0%
it is 10:00 I remind everybody this is
 
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
being streamed and so um we have the
 
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
mic's here if somebody can't hear us
 
00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 align:start position:0%
please let us know and I'd like to go
 
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 align:start position:0%
ahead and looking at the first portion
 
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
where the duties of the legislative
 
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
oversight Committee in the previous year
 
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
we added on to the legislative oversight
 
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
committee a responsibility to review and
 
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
make recommendations relating to the
 
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
academic standards under consideration
 
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
by the State Board of Education pursuant
 
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
to RSA 193
 
00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
E28 um that's the academic standards the
 
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
approval are a total responsibility
 
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
they're approved by the State Board of
 
00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
Education this committee has
 
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to look at academic
 
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 align:start position:0%
standards and as we look at it we also
 
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
look at uh part our statutes on 193e
 
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
where there is our 13 criteria for the
 
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
substitute criteria for an adequate
 
00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
education which are dealing with the
 
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
academic standards and therefore a
 
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this panel right here
 
00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
and when we're looking at this there's
 
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
certain SE within the the rules that are
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
being proposed there's a front side and
 
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
the back side I'm sure the commissioner
 
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
will speak to that the back side deals
 
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
with those subject areas the front side
 
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
deals with all those other areas within
 
00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
what does the school have to achieve To
 
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
Be An approved public school so it goes
 
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
from facilities to Staffing to number of
 
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
credits you need to graduate from high
 
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
school Min and and then it also gets
 
00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 align:start position:0%
into those subject areas with elements
 
00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 align:start position:0%
within so without going any further on
 
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to jump down now I wrote a
 
00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 align:start position:0%
letter to the
 
00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 align:start position:0%
commissioner and in that letter
 
00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 align:start position:0%
requested that uh we uh be have some
 
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
communication as where we are in that
 
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
process we recognize there's been an
 
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
extensive hearing process and we've had
 
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
an initial proposal we have a final
 
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
draft proposal uh and maybe we can be
 
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
updated as far as where we are on that
 
00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
whole process and then have um uh the
 
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
presentation start with the commission
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to welcome commissioner
 
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
edbl uh Welcome to our committee here
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
Frank and um floor is yours good morning
 
00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 align:start position:0%
and thank you for allowing me to come in
 
00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 align:start position:0%
I brought all kinds of uh cheat notes
 
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
Here depending on what kinds of
 
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:21.800 align:start position:0%
questions you all have hopefully I can
 
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
um you know respond to those I wanted to
 
00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
start my conversation I'm just going to
 
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
offer some comments and then I know
 
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
there's probably some questions and
 
00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 align:start position:0%
queries yeah but I want to start my
 
00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.590 align:start position:0%
queries yeah but I want to start my
comments

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
um you know in with uh RSA 193
 
00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 align:start position:0%
E1 Roman numeral 2 which I think sets
 
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
kind of a a philosophy for um this Ru
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
making process and I want to be clear
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
when I uh share this information with
 
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
you that uh I represent the Department
 
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
of Education a state agency these rules
 
00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
are the responsibility and owned by the
 
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education um I don't have
 
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
a vote on that committee so I'm happy to
 
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
update you in terms of where we are but
 
00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
I just think it's that clear um but in
 
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
193 E1 Roman numeral 2 I'm going to
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
start about halfway through just to not
 
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
overly read to you um in this section
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
the state establishes minimum standards
 
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
for public school approval and academic
 
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
standards for inclusion in the delivery
 
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
of educational services at the local
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
level school districts then have
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility and flexibility in
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
implementing diverse educational
 
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 align:start position:0%
approaches to instruction and curriculum
 
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
tailor to meet the students needs and so
 
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
as we have approached this rule proposal
 
00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
um we have tried to keep in mind the
 
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
Mandate from the legislature uh that
 
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
school districts have responsibility and
 
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
flexibility in implementing a diverse uh
 
00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
array of educational approaches to
 
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
instruction and curriculum tailor to
 
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
meet students needs and we want to make
 
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
sure that this rule proposal does not uh
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
interrupt their ability to meet their
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
legislative obligation uh under
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
193e um so just to kind of talk to you
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
about the process as you describe we're
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
kind of in the middle of this it's been
 
00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:18.629 align:start position:0%
kind of in the middle of this it's been
a

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 align:start position:0%
three-year problem and as you point out
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
Rick uh we have bifurcated this rule
 
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 align:start position:0%
proposal into what we refer to as a
 
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
front half and a back half the front
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
half deal primarily with um how uh
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
schools operate right how you how you
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
functionally run the school and then the
 
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
back half dealing much more closely
 
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
associated with content uh I'm happy to
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
speak to both parts of that but the
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
front half is the part that is before uh
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
this committee and that is the the the
 
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
furthest along in that Ru making process
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
um it is uh sort of an interesting
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
couple of interesting facts for this
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
committee that they may not know um
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
there was an attempt in 2014 um by my
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
predecessor to update the 306s in
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
particular the back half um that was not
 
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
successful it's interesting I I have a a
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
copy of the the minimum standards that I
 
00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
actually printed out before I even took
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
this job um to familiarize myself with
 
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
what was going on in there I'm on my
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
second um spine of duct tape that's how
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
much worn out they are but even in this
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh in this proposal they talk about here
 
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
are uh you know here are rules rules
 
00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:33.639 align:start position:0%
that apply until July 1st 2015 and then
 
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
here's the rules that will apply from
 
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
July 1st 15 onward anticipating that
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
they would have been approved um sadly
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh that effort was unsuccessful uh I
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
want to share another piece of rules at
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
that time were reopt to the old correct
 
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
they just kept the old rules right so
 
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
nothing was nothing changed exactly I
 
00:07:53.309 --> 00:07:53.319 align:start position:0%
remember that thoroughly oh do you okay
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
I was not part of it but I just thought
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
that was interesting um I also want to
 
00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
read a couple of headlines that I think
 
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.400 align:start position:0%
might be telling for you so this is a
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
headline fur in New Hampshire on vote to
 
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.589 align:start position:0%
headline fur in New Hampshire on vote to
cut

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
cut
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
standards um and reading from this
 
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
particular article it says the change
 
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
would free cities and towns to set their
 
00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
own standards for maximum class size
 
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
Advocates say the change would give
 
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
local districts more flexibility arguing
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
this could lead to improve schools and
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
to tailoring School services to meet
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
Community needs similar to the um you
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
know what it says in the statute what is
 
00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
interesting about these two articles uh
 
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
they are from The New York Times from
 
00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
1992 and I read this and I was like oh
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
my goodness we're still having the same
 
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
conversations from 1992 and now um so
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
you can see that this is an effort that
 
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
has been ongoing and the conversations
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
have been taking place for decades uh
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire and I
 
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
think I share that because um I mean
 
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's important everybody who is
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
working on this rule proposal has has
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
the same goal we want our students to
 
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
have the best opportunities to succeed
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
in life and uh that is what we are after
 
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
and so we are you know the all the
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
conversation that takes place around
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
this I think we need to stay focused on
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're all sitting here
 
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
sitting here and working to try and
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
benefit uh the students of and the
 
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
children of New Hampshire um the process
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
started out with a working group with
 
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.360 align:start position:0%
the national Center for Competency Based
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
learning um that working group included
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
superintendents principal School Board
 
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
teachers digital Equity project leaders
 
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
Business Leaders uh and other Educators
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
um and they got together initially and
 
00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
were working on kind of some initial uh
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
an initial draft that they were working
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
on uh they held a number of listening
 
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
sessions uh across the state um as well
 
00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:49.959 align:start position:0%
as as a group and a lot of virtual
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
sessions um they held working sessions
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
there was a working session in the fall
 
00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
with 45 Educators um and then after that
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
Christine Downey held working uh uh
 
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
listening sessions with over 200
 
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
Educators around the state um whereas a
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
typical rule proposal has a single
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
public hearing uh this particular rule
 
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:13.880 align:start position:0%
proposal had three public hearings uh to
 
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that we created many
 
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people to weigh in on
 
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:20.839 align:start position:0%
this rule uh we also created an extended
 
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
uh public input period that lasted
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
through the end of April uh again to
 
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
afford everyone an opportunity to weigh
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
in in on this um and in spite of all of
 
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
this I I will say that there continues
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
to be uh a variety of uh inaccurate
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
information relative to the rule
 
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
proposal but I'm happy to respond to
 
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
questions about that um there are
 
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
because this is uh a a a process that's
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
in the middle like we're still this
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
process is still ongoing the board is
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
still working on this rule proposal um
 
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
so I have a document in front of me here
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to share this with you but
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
again understand that it's a fluid
 
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
document and it includes a side by side
 
00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
and the side by side um it includes uh
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
you know the initial what do we call it
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
the the current rule you know so
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
basically what's in currently in the
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
306s and then what we have is the
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
initial proposal which was adopted I
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
believe in February and then subsequent
 
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
to that initial adoption uh we had
 
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:23.720 align:start position:0%
meetings with uh you know ongoing
 
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
meetings because it wasn't like this was
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
the first time we had ongoing meetings
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
with the Nea and with the uh nhsaa some
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
Business Leaders um to work on to
 
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
further work on that initial proposal
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
and we reached agreement on a number of
 
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
additional changes um and then we
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
received feedback from Jael car and so
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
we've responded and are working on
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
responses to the Jael car comments as
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
well so just try to be really
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
transparent and keep track of these uh
 
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
this is the document that the board was
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
working on in their last working session
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
the board scheduled a separate working
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
session apart from their normal meeting
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
schedule uh for the sole purpose of
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
working on this uh so that anybody who
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
was interested could come and here uh
 
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
you know the deliberations of the board
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of wrestling through and
 
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the different aspects in the
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
different areas um I want to flag a
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
couple of uh you know changes to this
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
document that I think are excuse me just
 
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
for one second commissioner um we have
 
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
copies of the current 306s here great
 
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240 align:start position:0%
the initial and the proposed but we
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
don't have a copy of that side by side
 
00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
is that available so that the committee
 
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
can have that at the close of the
 
00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
meeting today yes we will email that
 
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
over to you said that you'll have a copy
 
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
of that um and so there is not just to
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
be clear so there's not a final proposal
 
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
yet the board is still working on this
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh in that working session I got I think
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
we got through about page 67 or
 
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
something right like obviously this a
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
very substantive rule um and they intend
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
to take it up at this next meeting until
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
and and continue to work through the
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
rule proposal so there will likely be
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
additional changes that they adopt um
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
but I want flag a couple of areas for
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
you um so one of the substantive changes
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
that took place here was that we've
 
00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:07.959 align:start position:0%
added a number of definitions um working
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
with the Nea NH hsaa uh to make sure
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
that we're providing Clarity throughout
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
this document um and everybody's on the
 
00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
same page um it's interesting um there
 
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:22.959 align:start position:0%
was one uh term in the uh in The
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
Proposal we had created a definition but
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
then we never used the word uh and so
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
that and people were like well why
 
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
didn't you why did you take that out I'm
 
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
like well because we didn't actually use
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
it any place so we're trying to figure
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
out if there's a place where that needs
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
to be used but you know we so because
 
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
the intent here is not to create a
 
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
dictionary as much as it is to to
 
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
clarify terms that will be used in this
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
role proposal um another place that
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
there was some confusion um and
 
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding is uh in my draft is on
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
page 32 but it really is in
 
00:13:57.629 --> 00:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
section 306 oh no that's
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
.11 306
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
6.12 um and here a couple of years ago
 
00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:04.189 align:start position:0%
6.12 um and here a couple of years ago
the

00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
legislature uh homogenized the education
 
00:14:10.269 --> 00:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
statutes with other statutes of
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
oplc uh to refer to Educators as
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
licensed Educators um and so that
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
resulted in us changing the term
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
certified to licensed and there were
 
00:14:22.749 --> 00:14:22.759 align:start position:0%
individuals who saw the term certified
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
struck out and misunderstood that that
 
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
had been changed to license to just make
 
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
it consistent with the law so we heard a
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
lot of uh you know feedback from people
 
00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
like why did you eliminate certified
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
Educators and we certainly haven't in
 
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
this proposal uh we just made use the
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
term licensed which is what is
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
consistent with statute so wanted to
 
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
flag that one for you if that's one
 
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
that's interesting to you um as well
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
there was uh in that in a in that
 
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.870 align:start position:0%
there was uh in that in a in that
section

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
30615 um which is in the proposal 30
 
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
6.12 but uh so we talked about Educators
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
including art music health physical
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
education teach teachers in accordance
 
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:01.839 align:start position:0%
with the class size requirements and so
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
basically those were already included in
 
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
the class size so nobody's eliminating
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
the requirements for art and music and
 
00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
health education teachers uh they are
 
00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
already called out in the section on
 
00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
30617 where that resides and so this was
 
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
a redundancy and it was just to
 
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
clarifying the language in here um and
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
then I want to talk are you willing to
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
rather than jump over to talk about
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
30617 yeah that's where I was going to
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
go next actually is the CL the class
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
size yes that was the next item and
 
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
again I'll answer anything that we want
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay so it's interesting so I I didn't
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
know this until maybe like last week
 
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
when I found those uh articles from 1992
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
that this conversation about class size
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
is one that's been going on for decades
 
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
um and really let me try to summarize
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
kind of the perspective of uh you know
 
00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:52.519 align:start position:0%
the department and not necessarily board
 
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
and so I I make sure that that is clear
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
um although this is the proposal from
 
00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
the board you know the the proposed rule
 
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
said the local School Board shall
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
establish student centered ratios that
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
promote student learning as appropriate
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
for each learning opportunity learning
 
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
level I mean there was a great deal of
 
00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
concern that we're eliminating class
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
sizes and so I just philosophically I
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
would tell you that the board is not
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
fixed on something here we're really
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
trying to have a substantive
 
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
conversation around this specifically
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
because if you are designing instruction
 
00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
the first question that you would ask
 
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:26.720 align:start position:0%
yourself would not be how many kids do I
 
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
put in a classroom the first question
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
you'd ask yourself is like what is the
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
content that I'm teaching you might then
 
00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
ask yourself what is the pedagogical
 
00:16:36.309 --> 00:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
approach that I'm going to be using the
 
00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959 align:start position:0%
next question you might ask yourself is
 
00:16:39.309 --> 00:16:39.319 align:start position:0%
what are the characteristics of these
 
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
individual Learners and then you might
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
get to how many of them should I cohort
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
together in order to create an effective
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
instructional environment and I don't
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
think that there's really any um debate
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
that there's more that goes into uh you
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
know making this determination than just
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
coming up with a number
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
um and so the board was really uh trying
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
to come up with some language that would
 
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
capture the the process that we want
 
00:17:11.029 --> 00:17:11.039 align:start position:0%
schools to go through in order to be
 
00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
able to figure out what is the right
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
number of students to cohort in a class
 
00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
because um if you have uh you I mean 24
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
if let's say 24 is a number you put 24
 
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
struggling second grade readers into
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
class that's too many right like that
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
cohort side is wrong but if you had ask
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
all those precursor questions you might
 
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
end up at a different place and so we're
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
trying to just make sure that that
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
happens um you know we did ask uh a
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
number of organizations for proposed
 
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
language nobody's actually come up with
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
the uh the magic bullet on that one in
 
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280 align:start position:0%
terms of what it is um you know language
 
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
that is being discussed right now as a
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
local school board shall establish
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
student educator ratios that promote
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
student learning uh for each learning
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity and learning level based
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
upon school safety policies content
 
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
instructional method and characteristics
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
of Learners and then the local school
 
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
board shall adopt model class sizes that
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
shall be used solely for purposes of
 
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
estimating School District budgets um
 
00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
and again this is proposed language
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
certainly the uh the board is open to
 
00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
whatever that might look like um it's
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
interesting since 1992 when we had this
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
debate previously maybe we had it before
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
that I don't know we have not seen an
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
increase in the educational attainment
 
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
of the students right so we've held the
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
line but we've not seen an increase in
 
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
outcomes and uh from from our students
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
and so the question is is there
 
00:18:31.789 --> 00:18:31.799 align:start position:0%
something that we can do here that helps
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
now understandably on the flip side of
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
this there is a fear among many
 
00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
communities and we've heard this loud
 
00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
and clear in the public comment that
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
what this will do is cause uh
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
irresponsible School boards
 
00:18:51.549 --> 00:18:51.559 align:start position:0%
to pack 50 students into a classroom and
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
you know resulting in a degradation of
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
the quality of the education that those
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
students are receiving in fact that's
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
not what anybody's intention is trying
 
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
to do right like we're all trying to
 
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're creating better
 
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities for students um and so the
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
question is how do we is there a way to
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
structure this I mean maybe we just got
 
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:11.799 align:start position:0%
to go back to the 1992 just put a number
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
in there um but I might even argue and
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
I've heard argumented in the public
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
comment that by just limiting those
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
class sizes we're also not preparing
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
students for the future particularly in
 
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
a postsecondary so you have a student
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
who's never been in a classroom that's
 
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
greater than 24 or 30 kids kids or many
 
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
of these students you know are in
 
00:19:32.669 --> 00:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
classes of 12 students and all of a
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
sudden they find themselves in some
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
post-secondary institution at Ohio State
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
or at UNH with 300 students in the
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
seminar class right and so um but we're
 
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
you know I I can tell you that this is
 
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
not a hard conversation for the board
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
they feel very comfortable that you know
 
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039 align:start position:0%
if we just have to go back then to where
 
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
we were that's okay but they want to try
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we challenge
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves that we challenge a state to
 
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
uh have an
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity yeah I got I got one I I
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
just have a couple of more points I was
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
going to flag for you and I'll take
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
questions are you're still in this
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
section yep okay why you go continue
 
00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:12.919 align:start position:0%
with the section you're on which is
 
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
30617 okay and if there's anything
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
because there are questions from us okay
 
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
do you want to do let me go you want to
 
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
get through all my highlights for you or
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
you want to stop at each one I can stop
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
here if you want let's stop right here
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
while we're on it and had a little bit
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
of a discussion already 30617
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
it talks about uh learning levels first
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
grade levels it also uh has that that
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
current pupil teacher ratio is K through
 
00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
2 25 to1 and then grades 3 through 12 30
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
to1 yes and with recommendation to be
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
less to
 
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
25 the concern that we had when we were
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
costing out the the education formula
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
budget and we're I'm sliding into
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents you are yeah and and
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
we had suggested that it be K through
 
00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
three at 20 to1 and then um grades four
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
on upwards at that 25 one I believe
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we had within our recommend
 
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
it didn't fly anywhere but as the State
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
Board taking a a a real significant look
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
at this we realized that 30 to1 in an
 
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
Elementary classroom is is pretty tough
 
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
and it's if you're going to relate the
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
dollars ability to pay these people
 
00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:32.039 align:start position:0%
that's they're
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
connected so the question is you know is
 
00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
the state board really taking a good
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
look with because we are seriously
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
looking at ourselves yeah so I mean I I
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
think it's it's pretty obvious that the
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
State Board is pretty serious about this
 
00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
even with the proposal they're saying
 
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
like look we have to ask the right
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
question 30 first graders or second
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
graders is too many kids in a classroom
 
00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
even 25 might be too much you know a CO
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
if you have struggling readers then that
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
then 10 might be too many right like so
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to say is
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
is there a way to ask more to to to
 
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
write this rule in a way that provides
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
you know as the statute says
 
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility and flexibility to that
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
loal local school district and come to
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
good outcomes and not create a
 
00:22:15.789 --> 00:22:15.799 align:start position:0%
circumstance where an irresponsible
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
School Board does something stupid for
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
these kids right I mean I don't know
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
that that's going to happen nobody knows
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen but uh but you
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
know so we're trying we so I think we
 
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
agree on all these kind of constraining
 
00:22:28.269 --> 00:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
factors and and they 100% are looking at
 
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
this I I guess my last and then I'll let
 
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
others High School can make the the
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
necessary changes they can load up a PE
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
class or some other classroom but an
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
Elementary classroom is a classroom
 
00:22:44.909 --> 00:22:44.919 align:start position:0%
and everything's taught in that in those
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
four walls mostly and so you know I
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
think there's got to be a lot of
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility for K through a um that's my
 
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
two cents worth uh are there questions
 
00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
here representative Cornell
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
I I think it's it's fine to say that
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
leaving it up to individual school
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
districts will take the responsible way
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
of doing it but when you come across a
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
school district that's struggling with
 
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
money with finances or even struggling
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
to find teachers they're going to double
 
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
up on the size of their classes because
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
they have no other choice to do it
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
unless it's in statute that they can't
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
and if we don't tell them that you can
 
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
only have so many kids in a class if
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
they're struggling and they can save
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
money by doing it they're going to do it
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
so I I think it needs to be in there the
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
the exact class size and and if they
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
want to make it smaller they can but I
 
00:23:42.269 --> 00:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
don't think we should let them make it
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
bigger than what it could be yes and
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
we've heard that feedback and the board
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
has heard that feedback loud and clear
 
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
um but you can understand that what
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
we're really trying to say is how do we
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
have this conversation about setting the
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
right class size is what we're trying to
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
get to maybe we can't get there um and
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate all of that what you
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
said is all relevant feedback I mean the
 
00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:02.919 align:start position:0%
only thing that doesn't help me is is
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
you know that poor uh secondary student
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
who goes off to University and finds
 
00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
himself in a 300 person seminar that's
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
never really experienced anything so
 
00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559 align:start position:0%
maybe if there were opportunities in our
 
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
secondary environment to to get kids
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
some kinds of exposures like that too uh
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
because we we want our kids to be
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
successful in that post-secondary world
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
as well what follow up follow up we all
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
did that though I mean I I was in
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
classes of 20 25 in high school and I
 
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
went to un where sometimes I would have
 
00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
500 600 and I'd be watching it on a
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
screen yeah and so what we know is so
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
when those students go to those post-se
 
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
environments they can do it well some do
 
00:24:40.389 --> 00:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
it but actually what you'll find is that
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's one of the biggest areas where
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
they don't succeed right because of the
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
degree of transition I'm glad that you
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
did it I did it I'm sure many of you did
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
it but there are students who are not
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
successful in making that transition so
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
is there something we can do to help
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
them transition right do we have a study
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
that shows us how many have failed no I
 
00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
just have anecdotal information and
 
00:24:59.669 --> 00:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
feedback from my uh you know
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
post-secondary universities okay thank
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
you y the last part I I needed a
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
rationale why we're changing it from
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
grade to learning level we're going to
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
have different learning levels at every
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
grade um so there be the part of the
 
00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
issue and we we're trying to drive
 
00:25:20.909 --> 00:25:20.919 align:start position:0%
towards a competency based education so
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
how's that come into this mix yeah so I
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
think it it's just yet more conversation
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
about trying to move towards a
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
competency based system and I think that
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
this is a conversation that came out of
 
00:25:31.149 --> 00:25:31.159 align:start position:0%
that original study committee when they
 
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
were looking at this and trying to say
 
00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:36.919 align:start position:0%
like you know really you know we're when
 
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
we say grades which is it's vernacula
 
00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:41.559 align:start position:0%
that we're all so familiar with right uh
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
because it's been around for a very long
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
time but the reality is we want to focus
 
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:48.200 align:start position:0%
on students and students learning
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
Pathways and students are going to be at
 
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
different levels and so the question is
 
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
by using different vernacular does that
 
00:25:56.830 --> 00:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
help us look at a student differently as
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to assuming because the student
 
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
is in fourth grade this is what they
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
need to be learning even if they haven't
 
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
mastered the third grade learning yet
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
right so we've moved this kid along but
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
we can say like okay so in math Billy's
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
on the fifth learning level in uh you
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
know reading language arts maybe he's at
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
the third learning level so we're really
 
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
trying to create a system that is
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
responsive to those students again not a
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
conversation not a not a change that I
 
00:26:24.909 --> 00:26:24.919 align:start position:0%
think the board is fixated on uh as much
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
as just saying like how do we continue
 
00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
to move forward our Competency Based
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
Learning System that recognizes that you
 
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
know students we don't want to dictate
 
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
to students what they should be learning
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
plus or minus 180 days to the day they
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
were born on which they had no say in um
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
essentially is what we're after here
 
00:26:46.909 --> 00:26:46.919 align:start position:0%
thank you why we move on
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
here okay any further questions on that
 
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
portion I know there are but there it
 
00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:53.240 align:start position:0%
they probably I have a question with the
 
00:26:55.149 --> 00:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
the certified teacher as opposed to a
 
00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
licensed person um is there an oursa
 
00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
that that says it's okay to use a
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
licensed rather than certified teacher
 
00:27:03.549 --> 00:27:03.559 align:start position:0%
in public schools there is in fact it
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
changed it the this you changed the um
 
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
the language in the law to talk not
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
about certified Educators anymore but
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
about licensed Educators so we just were
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
trying to make the law to make the rule
 
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
reflect what you did to the law several
 
00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.149 align:start position:0%
reflect what you did to the law several
years

00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
ago so you've changed the law to
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
reference the requirements for licensed
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
Educators and so now the rule will
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
reflect the statute as well I can have
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
someone send over that statute that be
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
helpful so and follow up to that sort of
 
00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
Frank um within statute it says grades
 
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
yep doesn't say learning level
 
00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
so some may construe that by rule we're
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
changing statute which is counter you
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
know yeah which would be fly against
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
that argument no no question about it
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
and so we I don't think the board is
 
00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:53.559 align:start position:0%
fixated on that so much as wanted to
 
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
make sure we have this conversation
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
about are we designing a system that's
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
respons to what the kid needs to learn
 
00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:02.519 align:start position:0%
not based on what day they were born on
 
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
okay so given I mean and again this is
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for feedback I'm going to
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
bring all this feedback back to the
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
state board and uh you know just reflect
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
for them that they're not interested in
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
learning levels they're interested in my
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
my comment has nothing to do whether I
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
like or dislike something it it has to
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
do with consistency yeah no it has a
 
00:28:25.389 --> 00:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
deal with legislative responsibility and
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
executive responsibility
 
00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:29.630 align:start position:0%
executive responsibility
the

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
executive takes law and goes moves
 
00:28:36.909 --> 00:28:36.919 align:start position:0%
forward with a law it doesn't write law
 
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're sort of seeing and
 
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
maybe in some cases where you change the
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
definition of Competency when competency
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
is clearly established currently in law
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's where I'm driving here
 
00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:51.519 align:start position:0%
and we ALS often times say grade levels
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
course program what have you and now
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
we're we're seeing a change coming from
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
the board rather than through the
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
legislative process so I guess what I
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
would how I would respond to that is um
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
you know this is a fairly substantive
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
you know like I've got like a 80 page
 
00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
rule proposal that we've tried to hear
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
from a whole bunch of constituencies um
 
00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:13.519 align:start position:0%
and I think to your point we see as an
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
agency our responsibility is to have
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
100% Fidelity to the law um so for
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
example again that Competency Based
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
definition was developed with all kinds
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
of input from all kinds of stakeholders
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh when we got the feedback from the um
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
from Jael car on like hey competen is
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
already defined in legislature I think
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
that the board is just going to adopt
 
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
the legislative definition because we
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
don't have authority to come up with our
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
own definition if you've already defined
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
a term thank you
 
00:29:45.149 --> 00:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
y so let me uh just a couple of other
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
things I'll hit
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
so um let's see the next thing this was
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
a something that was pointed out and we
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
haven't resolved this completely yet um
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
but uh in in
 
00:29:59.159 --> 00:30:08.669 align:start position:0%
but uh in in
section

00:30:08.669 --> 00:30:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
306 hang that's a long one
 
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
30621 uh which is around high school
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
curiculum and credits and stuff like
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
that and then if you go to E we have a
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
list of uh you know courses that are uh
 
00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
that the schools are required to offer
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
and um so this is another one that car
 
00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:29.799 align:start position:0%
pointed out to us and and we think we
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
have to resolve this um but in
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
particular we've got something called
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
family and consumer science that's
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
enumerated there that the school is
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
required to offer that that is not in my
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
list that is allowable under 194 193 E2
 
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
right in other words so as I understand
 
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
the statute right if I look at that
 
00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
statute I'm allowed to make rules
 
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
relative to the stuff that you guys have
 
00:30:56.629 --> 00:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
given me but I don't get to go make up
 
00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
and and require a school to offer a
 
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
course that you've not as a legislative
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
body already required and so again cons
 
00:31:06.669 --> 00:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
family and consumer science has been in
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
there for decades right as a requirement
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
but uh as jel car pointed out they're
 
00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
like hey family consumer science not is
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
not in the list so what is your
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to create rules
 
00:31:20.029 --> 00:31:20.039 align:start position:0%
around that and we said good question
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
it's already been it's always been in
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
there so um one that we'll take back but
 
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the if the you know you
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
all want to you know wait in on that
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
figure give us an opportunity to do so
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'd like then to just jump when you talk
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
about family consumer science uh we have
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
as one of the 13 criteria personal
 
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.310 align:start position:0%
as one of the 13 criteria personal
finance

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
finance
 
00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
literacy and that was just added in the
 
00:31:47.549 --> 00:31:47.559 align:start position:0%
statute what a year or two ago um as
 
00:31:48.629 --> 00:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
part of
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
adequacy and and I don't see any
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
reference to that and how how are we
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
going to deal with that and in the past
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
for example when we had like the fourth
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
year mathematics embedded the that
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
course in into the fourth year we took
 
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:05.240 align:start position:0%
statutory language and put that into
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
rule yeah um and and how we going to I
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
was talking to several people at
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
graduation kids and they're saying I
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
still don't know how to write a check
 
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
oops uh that's a real whoops and that's
 
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
what and that's what we heard from the
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
bankers Association too when we went
 
00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
after personal finance literacy so how
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
do we integrate that into does it come
 
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.039 align:start position:0%
underneath what we just discussed yeah
 
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
so we if you see in the proposal we've
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
added number 18 personel finance and
 
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
financial literacy as a category um and
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
we have had conversation to say like
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
well do we have statutory Authority for
 
00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:41.919 align:start position:0%
family and consumer science because that
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
incorporates to your point going right
 
00:32:45.389 --> 00:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
to personal financial literacy there's a
 
00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of personal finance in there
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
there is some economics that's
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
associated with that uh there might be
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
some social studies so does it fit into
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
those categories but otherwise we are
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
trying to determine if we have statutory
 
00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:00.919 align:start position:0%
authority to even uh have that category
 
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
do you have statutory authority to fit
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
it into economics that's under social
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
studies those five components I believe
 
00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:10.039 align:start position:0%
that we would if we wanted if we can
 
00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
make the case that family and consumer
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
science is you know economics or
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
something like that but I don't think
 
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
the board has concluded on this yet but
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying that's the
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
conversation we're having can we fit it
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
into these other categories in 193
 
00:33:27.149 --> 00:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
E2 uh or not and if we can't we don't
 
00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
know that we have statutory authority to
 
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
go forward if we do then our response to
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
jail car would be one that says well our
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority for family and
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
consumer science is that we believe that
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
this includes components of social
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
studies and personal finance and we just
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
have enumerated them as a separate line
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
item in this rule proposal but that's
 
00:33:46.269 --> 00:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing that we're just
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
working through as we put the rule
 
00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.750 align:start position:0%
working through as we put the rule
together

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.870 align:start position:0%
together
so

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:54.799 align:start position:0%
um so the another section that we have
 
00:33:56.629 --> 00:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
updated let me get this is going to be
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
on page 63
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
um is relative to so in the initial
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
proposal so uh in in the rule it
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
initially had like it said there were 43
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
courses that everybody was supposed to
 
00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
offer and then it enumerated in each
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
course specifically how many classes in
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
each course right um let me just grab
 
00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so in other words like in arts
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
education you have to have three courses
 
00:34:37.069 --> 00:34:37.079 align:start position:0%
in business education you have to have
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
three courses uh which by the way you
 
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
might have to try and figure out where
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
the business education fits in here as
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
well but um you know uh family and
 
00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
consumer science you're required to
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
offer three courses as we've talked
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
about and so um when we did the initial
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
proposal we were not able to identify
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
you know where this 43 came up came from
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
you know what was magical about 43 like
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
why not 45 or why not 40 or why not 60
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
like what is the number and why three
 
00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
art classes as opposed to four classes
 
00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:08.599 align:start position:0%
and why three family consumer science
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
and not two of those and more of this um
 
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
and so initially we just said that they
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
were required to offer learning
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities um in working with the Nea
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
hsaa uh you know there was a concern
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
that 43 was just a bridge too far like
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
if we pulled that out even though nobody
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
can really identify where it comes from
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
that that was just too substant of a
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
change so we basically said okay so you
 
00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:32.839 align:start position:0%
have to offer 43 but across these areas
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
so they're going to still offer at least
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
43 classes but they're going to offer
 
00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
them across these various domains but
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
again in offering school districts
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
flexibility and responsibility should we
 
00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
be dictating how many family and
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
consumer courses you should have as
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
opposed to saying you got to offer at
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
least 43 classes and they got to be
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
across these domains you got to offer
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
something in each of these domains but
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
we're not going to tell you how to
 
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:55.720 align:start position:0%
distribute those courses across those
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
domains and so that's uh really kind of
 
00:36:00.589 --> 00:36:00.599 align:start position:0%
where we are right now with that um so
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
that's an area that we've been working
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
on so you touched on the Arts and within
 
00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:09.319 align:start position:0%
statute we don't call it just the arts
 
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
program it's arts program including
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
music and the visual arts correct so why
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
are we not using that definition within
 
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
the 306s rather than just calling it The
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
Arts good feedback we can absolutely do
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
that yeah art we can absolutely do that
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
and that way and that that in and of
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
itself I like that RI because that would
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
incorporate these other elements into it
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
so that it can't those other elements
 
00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079 align:start position:0%
that you're requiring in statute won't
 
00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
be left out I think that's a great
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation and we might check some
 
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
of the other areas like Health it's
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
health and wellness y we should just our
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
language should just mirror that langage
 
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
we have in the criteria those 13 areas
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
is what we need to reflect English
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
language arts and reading yeah we just
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
use the the vernacular exactly yeah it's
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
a very helpful
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
meeting keep marching okay
 
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.790 align:start position:0%
meeting keep marching okay
um

00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
68 so here's a a section that has
 
00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:05.560 align:start position:0%
received very little public feedback
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
um which is other than so we had
 
00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:10.839 align:start position:0%
initially established something called
 
00:37:10.839 --> 00:37:12.230 align:start position:0%
initially established something called
graduation

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
expectations uh which is a little bit
 
00:37:16.109 --> 00:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
like a portrait of a graduate um this is
 
00:37:16.119 --> 00:37:18.910 align:start position:0%
like a portrait of a graduate um this is
in

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
section uh
 
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
30622 um and the only feedback that we
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
got really relative to those was that
 
00:37:28.349 --> 00:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
they would they want them to not be
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
graduation expectations but graduation
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
requirements um and so the the that's
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
kind of the public comment um I was
 
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
surprised um that we were kind of
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
dictating those I mean I like all the
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
content uh that is in there um but I
 
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
thought it was um you know in so many
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
other areas where we're trying to be
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
careful not to overreach and uh and
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
require stuff this is it was a
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
requirement and that was feedback so I
 
00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
just as I I'll leave that as a passing
 
00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:00.200 align:start position:0%
thing um the next area that I wanted to
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
flag for you is in the table um and this
 
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
is the table see jul I didn't bring a
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
copy of this see if I can read this uh
 
00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
it's a table
 
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
3061 and so in the initial proposal so
 
00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
this is the required credits for
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
graduation and in the initial proposal
 
00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:22.839 align:start position:0%
we had added additional required credits
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
and reduced the number of
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
electives um it initially it was six
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
electives and it reduced down to 2.5
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
electives um there was some concern I
 
00:38:35.829 --> 00:38:35.839 align:start position:0%
think at the board level that uh you
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
know we have compulsory education these
 
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
students are required to go to high
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
school for four years but really that's
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
almost a full year of electives um and
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
so if these are the minimum standards of
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
what we really want to make sure these
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
kids get when they get out of high
 
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
school is that too many electives um but
 
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
then again in working with the Nea and
 
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
when nhsaa uh that was modified and so
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
now there's four electives um but some
 
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
of the additions that you'll see in here
 
00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh included like a logic and rhetoric
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
course a Civ course where where are we
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
looking right now well with I found that
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
chart in the the original sorry um uh
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
let's see February 15 30621 sorry 30621
 
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't make a reference for
 
00:39:26.109 --> 00:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
okay are you you at the chart required
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
program areas and courses or are you at
 
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
the chart which deals with the required
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
courses for high school
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
graduation 3 to 6.2 6. it might be two2
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
hang on let me go I'll go look at the
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
other this is the problem when you have
 
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:45.560 align:start position:0%
so many versions of these things going
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I I've got I've got one version of
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
this 36.2 one that's titled alternative
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
programs no it's not that
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
the initial and it is
 
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
um if you're looking at the current rule
 
00:40:10.510 --> 00:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
I believe it's in
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
30627 there's a table called 3062
 
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:15.640 align:start position:0%
required subjects and credits for high
 
00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.230 align:start position:0%
required subjects and credits for high
school

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
graduation can and I'll give everybody a
 
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
minute to get there so 30627 in the
 
00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.990 align:start position:0%
minute to get there so 30627 in the
current

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
rule here 6.22
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
30622 and the proposed
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
rule yeah I'm just looking a different
 
00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
306.97 D2 which is required subjects and
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
credits for high school graduation in
 
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
the original in the current
 
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
rule do you have an extra copy of this
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
how many you got just
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
one that's so Mr chair the the initial
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
proposed that the commissioner's
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
reference is the February 15th 24
 
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
correct um and you said it's on
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
page 37 I believe the print out I've got
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
only has 33 Pages yeah okay so not to it
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah we took the uh the front side
 
00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.470 align:start position:0%
so yeah we took the uh the front side
stuff

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
there hey wa Julie will you go find it
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
for him and his Julie you can also look
 
00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:23.240 align:start position:0%
at your document and find it for you so
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
you can also find it in the current
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
standard it's in the current standard I
 
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:28.280 align:start position:0%
found it under 27 in the currency yeah
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's where it is okay so that's the
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
one we we're looking at then okay okay
 
00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.950 align:start position:0%
one we we're looking at then okay okay
okay

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
yeah um and so essentially what we had
 
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
initially done is we reduced the number
 
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
of elective credits from 6 to
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
2.5 um the board has subsequently looked
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
at increasing that to four um but has
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
added additional course
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
requirements um you know a logic and
 
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839 align:start position:0%
rhetoric a Civics and
 
00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:54.200 align:start position:0%
civility um you know then and again some
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
of this is in response to HB 216 which
 
00:41:59.550 --> 00:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
which was passed by the legislature that
 
00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
required certain courses relative to
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
history so we have a history uh
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
government constitution of the
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
US um and then what was added was a half
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
a credit in statistics or data
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
analysis so when we you're adding in
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
logic and and rhetoric yeah we want kids
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
thinking we want them
 
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
communicating we when we put that into
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
adequacy yep we stated that
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
those areas of learning should be
 
00:42:35.309 --> 00:42:35.319 align:start position:0%
integrated into all categories correct
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
so it's not one of the 13 It's down
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
below listed along with I believe
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
computer um and use and digital literacy
 
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
so why then are we making it a separate
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
course rather than integrating logic
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
thinking skills rhetoric able to
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
communicate with a little bit of logic y
 
00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.990 align:start position:0%
communicate with a little bit of logic y
uh

00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.400 align:start position:0%
into language arts into mathematics into
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
social studies into Science Biology Etc
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think that the um the purpose
 
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
what the board is thinking and again I
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
don't know I can't get into their minds
 
00:43:11.309 --> 00:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
completely but I think the thinking is
 
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:13.000 align:start position:0%
here that again these are the credits
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
that required for graduation so there's
 
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
now half a credit requirement for logic
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
and rhetoric um and it doesn't say that
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
that has to be offered as a separate
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
course but it does say whether it's
 
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
integrated or not integrated that you
 
00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:27.559 align:start position:0%
have to have to demonstrate logic and
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
rhetoric and I think the point that the
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
board was after there is to make sure
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
that there's an emphasis right uh
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes when we focus on the
 
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:37.240 align:start position:0%
integration it gets diffused and maybe
 
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
is not emphasized enough and I think
 
00:43:41.109 --> 00:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
that the board's intent there um and I
 
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:42.040 align:start position:0%
think that they believe they had
 
00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority given its call out
 
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
in 193 E2 uh to require a half a credit
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
in that and not be disruptive to whether
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
or not it's integrated or not integrated
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
like so they're not specifying that it's
 
00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.030 align:start position:0%
like so they're not specifying that it's
not

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
integrated we certainly won't don't want
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
to object to
 
00:43:59.230 --> 00:43:59.240 align:start position:0%
logic and rhetoric being used in our
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
schools um we the intent was basically
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
to integrate that and I but I know when
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
we initially had computers in schools we
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
had to have a separate computer class
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
now we it's just you know spreadsheet is
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
part of everything it is
 
00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.870 align:start position:0%
part of everything it is
yeah

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:44:17.589 --> 00:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
okay yes Reon Cornell so when you're
 
00:44:19.109 --> 00:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
saying the board thought are you saying
 
00:44:20.829 --> 00:44:20.839 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education is the one
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
who's determining what these subjects
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
are that a student needs to graduate
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
from high school that's correct it's the
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education that sets the
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
rules okay and but what do they
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
were the State Board of Education is
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
deciding what classes students need to
 
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
graduate from high school they're
 
00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
deciding what credits they need okay
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
thank you and so they're enumerating the
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
credits that are required for
 
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
graduation which is that's the system
 
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
that we've always had and then they're
 
00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
trying to do that in Fidelity to the
 
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
statutes that you all have
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
passed so by putting these in the
 
00:45:00.069 --> 00:45:00.079 align:start position:0%
equivalent required for graduation was
 
00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
was 20 credits correct it's still 20
 
00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
credits have not changed that okay just
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
have taken the six electives down to
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
four electives and added you know a half
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
a credit in mathematics specific to uh
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know statistics um you know half at
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
least a half ACC Credit in statistics
 
00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
and data analysis I think again the
 
00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
board's perception is that that's a very
 
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
gerine uh thing for kids to know to be
 
00:45:26.829 --> 00:45:26.839 align:start position:0%
able to look at data and statistics and
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
understand understand that um they've
 
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
added uh you know half Credit in logic
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
and rhetoric um and then I believe
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
they've got a half a credit in uh it's
 
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
called Civics and civility
 
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
so by doing this where rather than
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
integrating are we cutting back on uh
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
the Arts are we cutting back on those
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
subjects which a student would truly
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
would benefit later in life I think this
 
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
is some of the feedback that we got when
 
00:45:58.910 --> 00:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
we went from Two and a Half elective
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
credits to four elective credits some of
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
the feedback that we got from the Nea
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
from the nhsaa from some Educators were
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
like uh two things one is um you know
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
that that to your point there may be
 
00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
students who are more focused in some of
 
00:46:14.829 --> 00:46:14.839 align:start position:0%
these years and they want an opportunity
 
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
to get more exposures to that so we we
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
move that back to four the other is in
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
many of the high schools they have what
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
they refer to as kind of programs of
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
study so you may have students who you
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
know pursue kind of a um you know like a
 
00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
a particular pathway like a stem pathway
 
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:33.079 align:start position:0%
or an Arts pathway or Humanity's pathway
 
00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
and by creating these uh elective
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities it allows students to go
 
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
deeper in those particular Pathways and
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
have some more flexibility to do that
 
00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
whereas if we if we overly prescribe
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
exactly where those credits are going to
 
00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
be then it makes it more difficult for a
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
student to focus on steam or for stem or
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
focused only on the humanities or
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
something like that so I think when we
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
moved it back up to four that was in
 
00:46:58.990 --> 00:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
response to that kind of feedback that
 
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
we received higher education is doing
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
the same thing uh with with Nei and
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
taking that degree and maybe knocking it
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
down to 90
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
required so I've been highly involved in
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
a a degree in three program again
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
because students can go into
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
postsecondary and get their uh you know
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
their required classes in three years
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
and not have uh you know a full year
 
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:22.680 align:start position:0%
potentially and depending on the program
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
of um you know general education
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
requirements with more work base and
 
00:47:29.549 --> 00:47:29.559 align:start position:0%
internships different
 
00:47:32.589 --> 00:47:32.599 align:start position:0%
opportunities okay um just a couple more
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
things that I wanted to flag for you so
 
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
some of the public feedb we got was
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the Ed 306 rules around
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
facilities and uh this is simply because
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
those rules were completely they were an
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
exact duplicate between Ed 320 and Ed
 
00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:49.559 align:start position:0%
306 so the Ed 320 rules are the school
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
facility rules and so it didn't make
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
sense to have them in two places the
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
same exact rule um so now in the 306 we
 
00:47:58.109 --> 00:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
just ref reference you know the school
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
facilities pursu to the 320 rules so
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
that we're not repeating those rules um
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
and then the other area was relative to
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
assessment um so we used to have
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
assessments that were covered in here
 
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
but the assessment rules in the 306
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
previously cover both the requirements
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
for the state as well as the
 
00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
requirements for the um uh the local
 
00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:18.280 align:start position:0%
school district relative to assessment
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
and so initially we pulled that out and
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
we had a draft of just assessment rules
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
that would be required for the school
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
districts but it included both the
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
state's requir ments like because we
 
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
have certain requirements as an agency
 
00:48:31.309 --> 00:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
that we have to comply with as well as
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
the local school districts and uh so
 
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
from the public feedback that we got
 
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
essentially I think what the board's
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
going to do is take the school district
 
00:48:40.589 --> 00:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
assessment requirements put those back
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
into the 306s so we'll have an
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
assessment separate assessment rule that
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
will address the agency's rules relative
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
to assessment and then we'll put the
 
00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
school district's rules relative to
 
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
assessment into the
 
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
306s um and so those are some of the
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
changes that I was hoping to
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
flag for you um but I I'm sure that
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
there probably are other questions as
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
well that I'm happy to try and respond
 
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
to thank you are there now we're getting
 
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
into the Q&amp;A uh are there questions from
 
00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.349 align:start position:0%
into the Q&amp;A uh are there questions from
the

00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
committee and Can I by the way just
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
point out that this meeting has already
 
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
been immensely productive and thank you
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much well I I'll
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
start it out um going to the the front
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
page definitions Y and the reason why is
 
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
that a lot of these definitions impact
 
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
the back half correct we talked about
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
competencies or we talked about
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
performance or achievement um under the
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh definition of acknowledgement of
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
achievement means when a student has
 
00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.910 align:start position:0%
achievement means when a student has
demonstrated

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrated
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
achievement you know so we're we're
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
defining achievement as achievement but
 
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't cut it you know it doesn't
 
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
really can you tell me which definition
 
00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
you're oh not acknowledging that's the
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
old definition well no I'm looking which
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:01.839 align:start position:0%
um what do you have for a definition so
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
the the current rule says
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement of achievement means
 
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
when a student has demonstrated
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
achievement of District competencies or
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
graduation competencies that was changed
 
00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:13.880 align:start position:0%
to achievement of competencies means a
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
student has demonstrated competencies at
 
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
a proficient
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
level so we tried to eliminate that kind
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
of circular reasoning in the current
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
rule would it be proficiency of
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
competencies uh so we talk about
 
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
proficient as a as a term that's defined
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
so maybe it should be proficiency of
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
competencies we can take that back and
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
take a look at that just take a look at
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
it okay let me go to
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
Prof you're taking notes right and is
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
your definition of Competency is the
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
same as in statute correct and now we I
 
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
do know that the board is intending to
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
just update the competency definition to
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
mirror statute which is as it should be
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
okay the definition of work study
 
00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
practice is next
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay so this uh let me just get to that
 
00:51:03.069 --> 00:51:03.079 align:start position:0%
so what's interesting on the work study
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
practice is uh this was a comment that
 
00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:08.839 align:start position:0%
we got back from the from uh jel car so
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
we just again there we tried to just
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
stick with statute because you've
 
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
defined work study practices in 193 e2a
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
6D through F and we just referenced
 
00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:19.319 align:start position:0%
those it was interesting and we'll have
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
a conversation with Joker if they want
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
us to do that we referenced the statute
 
00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
jel car said well can you write these
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
out and we're like we just put the
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
statute in there why would we write them
 
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
out but uh so we'll figure out if they
 
00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
want us to write them out or if we can
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
just make a reference to the statutory
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
definition but we've used the definition
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
in statute right now so they're in 193 e
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
F the definition for um work study
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
practices is in 193
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
H Roman 7
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
excuse me Roman
 
00:52:04.589 --> 00:52:04.599 align:start position:0%
8 193 H tell me that again uh Roman 8
 
00:52:04.599 --> 00:52:07.309 align:start position:0%
8 193 H tell me that again uh Roman 8
H1

00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
H1
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
definitions now what what's what's your
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
definition in your proposed can you read
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
just in what you have there in the side
 
00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
by side be a good feedback too that
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
might be another good catch too so we
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
were using the definition this is why we
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
needed to re redo these statutes is um
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
we were using 183 e2a 6
 
00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and we were
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
referencing uh D through F so D says
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
applied learning means an educational
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
approach whereby students have the
 
00:52:36.750 --> 00:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to directly engage in
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
learning activities using Knowledge and
 
00:52:41.549 --> 00:52:41.559 align:start position:0%
Skills uh logic means a reasoning skill
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
that better enables student to analyze
 
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
problems in learning areas such as
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
mathematics and to develop problem
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
solutions to better understand the
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
principle um of cause and effect and to
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
develop critical thinking skills to
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
better identify fact from unverified
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
information or data and rhetoric means
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
the skill of speaking and writing as a
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
means of communicating or persuasion so
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
we those that's what you had in statute
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
and we use those I that's throw back to
 
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
193 yeah exactly so that's what we were
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
using I am concerned about the area
 
00:53:10.079 --> 00:53:11.150 align:start position:0%
using I am concerned about the area
underneath

00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
underneath
 
00:53:14.109 --> 00:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
performance uh accountability for the
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
work study practices so you're 194 H3
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
yes H1 oh H1 19 H1 193 H colon one yep r
 
00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
8 yep targeted sport
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
Improvement is this work study practices
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
in my book okay eight got it work stud
 
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
practices means those behaviors enhance
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
the learning achievement I think that
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
again I think another we should we could
 
00:53:43.069 --> 00:53:43.079 align:start position:0%
probably put that as the definition I
 
00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
think that's a good you've got that in
 
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
there but you chopped off on page 581
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
the next page over from and work study
 
00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
skills that contribute to success in
 
00:53:57.789 --> 00:53:57.799 align:start position:0%
college career and life that include
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
communication creativity collaboration
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
and self-direction no I think that this
 
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
should be the definition Rec I think
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
that's a good we good feedback yeah put
 
00:54:16.789 --> 00:54:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.069 --> 00:54:21.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.109 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
yes gson luno thank you very much Mr
 
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you very much
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner which of these um proposed
 
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
rules would you excuse me would you say
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
relate to academic
 
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
standards um so that is going to be the
 
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
back half generally um other than the
 
00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
section that we reviewed previously
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
which listed all of those academic areas
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
so right right and and when you talk
 
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
about and follow up Mr chair yes um when
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
you talk about this process is being um
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
and I think I'm using your word
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
infidelity with the laws what what does
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
that mean when it when it comes to um to
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
making changes to uh rules that relate
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
to academic standards like the ones you
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
just talked about um so I think that
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to align those content
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
areas that we referenced there to 193
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
e2a so okay and would that not sure I
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
understand the question do my best no
 
00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
but that's sort of what I was what I was
 
00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to draw out was was
 
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
what you just talked about cuz I think
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
193 e2a is the operative area when it
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
comes to uh the these um these minimum
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
standards and in particular uh e2a and I
 
00:55:43.599 --> 00:55:44.990 align:start position:0%
standards and in particular uh e2a and I
think

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.470 align:start position:0%
think
it's

00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.950 align:start position:0%
it's
Roman

00:55:49.950 --> 00:55:49.960 align:start position:0%
Roman
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
4 c um talks about how the state board
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
and this actually goes back to I think a
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
question a point you made right at the
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
top when you said the State Board owns
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
these rules but it but it says it says
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
right here in in Roman 4C it reads the
 
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
State Board shall not amend any existing
 
00:56:11.029 --> 00:56:11.039 align:start position:0%
academic standards and shall not approve
 
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
any new academic standards without the
 
00:56:15.069 --> 00:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
prior review and recommendation of the
 
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee correct
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
established in CA which is sort of um
 
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:23.480 align:start position:0%
subset of what we've got here today yeah
 
00:56:24.829 --> 00:56:24.839 align:start position:0%
well so that's the whole that's part of
 
00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:26.680 align:start position:0%
the reason why we bifurcated this
 
00:56:28.349 --> 00:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
because then we can the operational
 
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:31.640 align:start position:0%
rules can go forward but the those rules
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
that relate to academic standards and
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
content standards from 1932a would come
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature I think that's
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
the problem that jinny had back in 2014
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
right okay so so actually that's
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
something that you didn't really talk
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
about you talked about how in 2014 um um
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
those those rules did not uh did not
 
00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
succeed to go through the process but I
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
didn't but you didn't really talk about
 
00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
where they uh where they stopped I
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
because I was not in I was not here then
 
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm not exactly sure where they got
 
00:57:03.309 --> 00:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
stopped I just have the you know the
 
00:57:05.309 --> 00:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
draft of the proposal that had two
 
00:57:07.109 --> 00:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
versions like one that they proposed and
 
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
one that they didn't I don't I didn't
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
know why it didn't go forward what
 
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
happened on that is that 306 Point let's
 
00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:17.960 align:start position:0%
say 40 and then and and 306 4
 
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:21.640 align:start position:0%
One those all were we ran out of time
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
and there was a two week period there
 
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
when we had no rules
 
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
and that created problems obviously so
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
then we reflected back and reopt the
 
00:57:36.670 --> 00:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
rules that were in law at that time or
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
Jael C had previously approved that's
 
00:57:40.349 --> 00:57:40.359 align:start position:0%
where we ended up so all the proposals
 
00:57:40.359 --> 00:57:41.430 align:start position:0%
where we ended up so all the proposals
went

00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
went
 
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
down so we're going to try to get
 
00:57:45.029 --> 00:57:45.039 align:start position:0%
something to you that you can be happy
 
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
with and work on I don't you know well
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of areas we were happy
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
with but we just ran out of time the ru
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
making process and we do have the
 
00:57:54.750 --> 00:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys here from attorney fromel now
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair this is what I'm going at
 
00:57:58.109 --> 00:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
it's what you're just talking talking
 
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
about here the rulle making process and
 
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
and it it it would appear based on the
 
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:07.079 align:start position:0%
law that the rulle making process for
 
00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
any proposed rules that relate to
 
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
academic standards has a special process
 
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
that involves the um the legislative
 
00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
oversight committee and and and I guess
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
the one of the one of the things what
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
one of the one of my objectives to get
 
00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
out of out of um this meeting today is
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
really understand what that process
 
00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
looks like and what uh what your
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
anticipated timeline is for that process
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
so for example if um if rules that
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
pertain to academic standards have to be
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
reviewed and recommended by the
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
oversight um committee when's that going
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
to H when when's the idea that's going
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
to you know to happen is that going to
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
happen on August 14th or is that going
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
to happen um is it happening right now
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
um and you know uh and and how would
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
that process go um and and and I I would
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
really refer to and I'm sure you've seen
 
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
this before commissioner this um this
 
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
very overly complicated um uh flow uh
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
flowchart decision chart with respect to
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
JL car and I'm being factious when I say
 
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
overly complicated because I know it's a
 
00:59:22.829 --> 00:59:22.839 align:start position:0%
very involved process here in New
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but for the ACT for stand for
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
rules that relate to academic standards
 
00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:33.079 align:start position:0%
it has even some some additional um U
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
process uh in there involving oversight
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
so timeline process I'm wondering when
 
00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:41.559 align:start position:0%
um when we're going to really hear about
 
00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:43.640 align:start position:0%
um these
 
00:59:47.309 --> 00:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
things so that process again before I
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
can even get something to you I have to
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
get a consensus among the constituents
 
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
of uh you know Educators and the Nea and
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
NH HSA there's no reason for me to bring
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
you something that is not that we can't
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
reach consensus as uh as the education
 
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
system to even take a look at so um I
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
know that the board is working on that I
 
01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
don't know what their timeline is
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
they're they're actively working on it
 
01:00:14.349 --> 01:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
um you know is it probably over the
 
01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
summer sometime I would guess um you
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
know and again we're going to fit it
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
into we've also got the 1868 process
 
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
again just in conflicts with statutes
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
which is you know the State Board of
 
01:00:27.029 --> 01:00:27.039 align:start position:0%
Education shall adopt academic standards
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
right so I've got that statute that I
 
01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
have to reconcile with this same process
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
that I have over here in
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
193e um but so I mean they're working on
 
01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
it and but I until I have something that
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
is cooked enough to bring to you um you
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
know but I think that I will come to
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
before anything is final almost like in
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
this process uh so that you can then
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
have substantive weighin on it but I
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
want to bring something to you that's
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
pretty far no I I appreciate that very
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
much commissioner because we're not
 
01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
looking to waste anybody's time waste
 
01:00:59.029 --> 01:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
your time exactly and and so what what I
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
what I take that for for for today's
 
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
meeting is really an update we're
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
correct where where we are you talked
 
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
about so so today is is how we're in the
 
01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
middle of the process right
 
01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
now but I'm going to separate the two
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
processes because I've got the academic
 
01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
areas and then I've got the operational
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
stuff I think the operational stuff
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
we're okay we're going to just work
 
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
through this with the board and be able
 
01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
to move that process forward in jail car
 
01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
but relative to the academic stuff as
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
you point out there's an extra step in
 
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
that process
 
01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:28.839 align:start position:0%
does um and and just one more question
 
01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
CU you know I think there's I I have a
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
hard time delineating the the hard the
 
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
bright line difference between you know
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know form or process and and uh or
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know mechanical rules versus the
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
academic standards but in your opinion
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
where do where do things like class size
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
um fit in is that like like you know air
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
quality or is that like um what what uh
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
what teachers are doing in the classroom
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so well I mean so what teachers are
 
01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
doing in the classroom is probably not
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
the right vernacular I would use but if
 
01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
you look in the rules in the existing
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
rules I think it breaks about 31 uh
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
you'll see there's a very clear kind of
 
01:02:14.269 --> 01:02:14.279 align:start position:0%
delineation we started at uh 30631 is
 
01:02:16.349 --> 01:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
where it starts and we begin with Arts
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
education programs right so then we
 
01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:23.799 align:start position:0%
start in with content areas is where we
 
01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:26.839 align:start position:0%
began to make that shift and hence my
 
01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
question for you all relative to these
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
are content areas I think that we only
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
have authority to deal with areas that
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
are enumerated in 193 e2a I got family
 
01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
and consumer science which is not there
 
01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:41.559 align:start position:0%
but I do have it in here right and so
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
the question is you know and we'll work
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
on those and probably bring those to you
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have to decide you
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
guys want us to bring these you know
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
family and consumer science Rules do you
 
01:02:52.349 --> 01:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
want us like when I bring you a proposal
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
for those rules like we'll work on them
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
you got to decide hey Frank you guys
 
01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
don't have authority to take that
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
forward because your Authority on these
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
rules is limited to 193 e2a um but
 
01:03:05.069 --> 01:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
that's a decision that I think I really
 
01:03:06.269 --> 01:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
it's a legislative decision what do you
 
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
guys want us to do with this right and
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
and just along this this this whole
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
string and thank you commissioner I
 
01:03:16.430 --> 01:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate your um your your Indulgence
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
in this in this area but um in in the
 
01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:23.480 align:start position:0%
same section of law3 e2a dropping down
 
01:03:26.109 --> 01:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
to Roman 6B
 
01:03:28.029 --> 01:03:28.039 align:start position:0%
and now we're into the definitions area
 
01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
that you were just um talking about you
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
you cited a definition for Applied
 
01:03:35.789 --> 01:03:35.799 align:start position:0%
learning B is the definition of academic
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
standards so in that definition and
 
01:03:41.789 --> 01:03:41.799 align:start position:0%
statute uh academic standards means what
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
a student should know and be able to do
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
in a course or at each grade level so
 
01:03:47.829 --> 01:03:47.839 align:start position:0%
can you reference me where you're
 
01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:49.960 align:start position:0%
reading I'm not so I'm on page I'm on
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
page 560 on this book okay and where
 
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
which where are you reading uh down at
 
01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:56.750 align:start position:0%
which where are you reading uh down at
the

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
bottom academic standards and it's the
 
01:04:02.069 --> 01:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
definition yes okay um and so it means
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
what a student should know and be able
 
01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
to do in a course or at each grade level
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and and I'm wondering does that
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
does that definition of academic
 
01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
standards is that definition of academic
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
standards limited to uh just the the
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
curriculum um such as what begins on 30
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
in your rules on 30631 which you say is
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
the the bright line delineation between
 
01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
academic standards and or academic
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
related St rules and and and other rules
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
um is is the definition of academic
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
standards in law really a brightline
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
thing that really talks about that talks
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
about courses and programs or does what
 
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
a student should know and be able to do
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
in a course or at each grade level
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
also relate to for instance your your uh
 
01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
proposed class sizes by grade level or
 
01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:05.079 align:start position:0%
by learning uh level does it also relate
 
01:05:07.630 --> 01:05:07.640 align:start position:0%
to that too and and I'm just putting it
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
out there commissioner because just
 
01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
because the the the the current
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
rules front half and back half where the
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
back half is academic standard starting
 
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
on rule 31 for Arts education program
 
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
just cuz just cuz the State Board said
 
01:05:28.269 --> 01:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
it there years ago doesn't necessarily
 
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
mean that that academic standards
 
01:05:33.309 --> 01:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't relate to other things too just
 
01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
put so then so what I would tell you is
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's what the words say
 
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
I think the words are pretty clear in
 
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
terms of what's being said and as well
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
that would
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
contradict um you know the historical
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
how these rules have been worked on
 
01:05:49.549 --> 01:05:49.559 align:start position:0%
historically um really
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
forever uh in terms of the State Board
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
adopting changes to those front half um
 
01:05:58.349 --> 01:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
and implementing those for the schools
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
and then really when they work on the
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
back half the 31 forward the history has
 
01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
been that they come to the legislative
 
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
oversight committee for the most part
 
01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:09.799 align:start position:0%
I've found instances where they have not
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
even come to the legislative oversight
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
committee for changes there um so I
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
think that uh you know where the board
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.549 --> 01:06:23.559 align:start position:0%
line I think this discussion just
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
reinforces some of the issues that we'
 
01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:28.119 align:start position:0%
previously discussed for example in that
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
same section law there on page 560 when
 
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the minimum
 
01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:33.319 align:start position:0%
standards of public school approval and
 
01:06:35.269 --> 01:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
then academic standards when we talk
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
about grade level it's not learning
 
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
level yeah I understand and and and and
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
that's reflected throughout this book so
 
01:06:44.870 --> 01:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
I thought that was fair input yeah 100%
 
01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
heard that I think that that that's very
 
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
important and I I think what we need to
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
be looking at in terms of these academic
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
areas that they were in uh I know this
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
committee will like to have the
 
01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look for examp I was
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
looking at Career Technical education
 
01:07:01.069 --> 01:07:01.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm seeing some definition changes
 
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
there as well from what we have as
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
definition in the book and if you would
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
provide that to us if you know there's a
 
01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
statutary definition we will have
 
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
Fidelity to the statutory definition and
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
we'd like to follow that up with
 
01:07:14.589 --> 01:07:14.599 align:start position:0%
communication with you I know there's
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
two of us on the CTE advisory Council
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
right here on on this particular
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee as well and it's an area which
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
we see we need to be emphasizing more
 
01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:25.720 align:start position:0%
than we have in the state and then on
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
page 561 under the annotated version and
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
all that there's reference to the
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
application personal finance literacy
 
01:07:37.269 --> 01:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
and the intent was that to be not necess
 
01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:39.799 align:start position:0%
in under studies earlier in law we do
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
say it may be integrated within other
 
01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
areas but there is also an intent that
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
we must teach that stuff now I don't I
 
01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
I'm up to however you know Local
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
District wants to do it that's their
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
decision their choice but in the long
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
run we need to have some kind of a
 
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
measure or accountability that it is
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
being taught whether it's a separate
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
course a required course um I I think I
 
01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:05.799 align:start position:0%
like that the State Board really to
 
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
consider that this is an issue that has
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
been heard over and over and over again
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
our kids are don't know how to use a
 
01:08:15.069 --> 01:08:15.079 align:start position:0%
Visa card a Master Card they don't know
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
how to write a check they don't know how
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
to file taxes and on it goes so
 
01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
um so points of interest there
 
01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
also in the as we call these things like
 
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
Arts education I mentioned that should
 
01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
homogenize that with the statute I think
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea information and
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
communication Technologies program to
 
01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
Computer Sciences what we call it now uh
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
social studies including the other five
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
economics civics government history
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
geography yep um and under technology
 
01:08:53.789 --> 01:08:53.799 align:start position:0%
engineering education program um we have
 
01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
an engineering and Technology
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
there's some changes yeah we can
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
homogenize those I think that's really
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
good input
 
01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:03.799 align:start position:0%
so are there any other questions from
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
the committee here what we can do is we
 
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
can bump our heads together here not
 
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily this morning but uh at a
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
later date and trying to get some
 
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
information to you when would you need
 
01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:19.480 align:start position:0%
to receive that buy commissioner
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
um you know in the next I know you're
 
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
going through the the process right now
 
01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
yeah like I mean if you're able to get
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
us something by the end of the month
 
01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
that would be wonderful be fine okay we
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
can do that Mr chair yes thank you I've
 
01:09:33.390 --> 01:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
got just a a couple of um questions that
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
I think relate that are update okay
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
oriented um I've I've heard through just
 
01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
conversations with other people that um
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
that that um uh certain individuals who
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
have been leading this process have
 
01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
changed over time just wondering um uh
 
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
who's sort of handson um leading the uh
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh the development work on these uh on
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
these Draft rules right now well so I'm
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
not sure what changes you're referring
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
to because we have had continuity so I'm
 
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure how I I had just heard
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
um you know Ju Just from from people
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
suggesting to me that there had been
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
changes but but who's who's in fact the
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know sort of Le leading the Hands-On
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
work well I mean so these now are in the
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
Education okay okay um
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
the so the the the the research and
 
01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
development effort that was contracted
 
01:10:37.790 --> 01:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
out has been that those deliverables
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
have been met and now that's with now
 
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
this is with the State Board no there is
 
01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
still ongoing support from the national
 
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
Center for Competency Based education
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
okay there is ongoing support there okay
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
much is there is there anyone from the
 
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education that works with
 
01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
the board on any of this there are many
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
people that do depending upon what the
 
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
particular rule is like like
 
01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
me so do you have qu and if you have
 
01:11:04.430 --> 01:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
questions you can direct them to me and
 
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful thank you I know
 
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
I've worked with Steve Appleby I've
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
worked with Jeff beard it just depends
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
on the area there's there's all kinds of
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
areas right so we're calling in the
 
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:15.550 align:start position:0%
areas right so we're calling in the
various

01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
various
 
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
experts um but not you know some of
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
those individuals don't have domain
 
01:11:21.149 --> 01:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge that cuts across many
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
different areas and then we have
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who are have expertise in
 
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
the jail car and the r writing process
 
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
who are involved in it as well Julie has
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
joined can you answer this for me please
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
um when we look at the back half and
 
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
we're looking at those curriculum areas
 
01:11:38.669 --> 01:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
relevant to the the 13 categories and
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
criteria for an adequate education we
 
01:11:43.149 --> 01:11:43.159 align:start position:0%
noticed for example when we looked at we
 
01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
had the number of bills coming to us
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
this year dealing with mental health of
 
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
of students in their schools and we saw
 
01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
that mental health was one of those
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
elements listed underneath health and
 
01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
wellness as those areas been struck
 
01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
in what I believe you know in the copies
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
I have here there's all lines going
 
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
through all those elements why are we
 
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
striking out some of those items which
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
have our our curriculum Frameworks are
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
outdated most of them and so we looked
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
at that and and when we looked at that
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
we say well we are providing mental
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
health it's required in the 306s I can't
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
remember what part was whether was that
 
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
36 or whichever one it might have been
 
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
right why we why did we strike all that
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
stuff yeah so I mean there's ongoing
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
work on the back half of the document
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
and part of that is because um over time
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
that back half of the document has um
 
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
gotten what I would refer to as somewhat
 
01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
confused sometimes um and convoluted um
 
01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
as representative luno pointed out um
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know the the State Board of
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
Education so you're setting 193e and
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
you're saying these are the areas of
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
study uh the State Board of Education is
 
01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
adopting academic standards in those
 
01:12:59.470 --> 01:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
various areas um you know whether that's
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
common core for my mathematics my
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
English language arts we've got social
 
01:13:05.629 --> 01:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
study standards we've got Health
 
01:13:08.669 --> 01:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
standards um and then so and so you have
 
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
these standards and then essentially
 
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
those standards then are supposed to
 
01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:13.669 align:start position:0%
those standards then are supposed to
translate

01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
translate
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
into cials that aligns to those
 
01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
competencies which align to those
 
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
standards right that's the dividing line
 
01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
the state is adopting standards the
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
local district is responsible for
 
01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
developing the competencies that align
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
to those stand standards and the
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum for instructing that um what
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
happens is these academic areas in the
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
back of this document sometimes come in
 
01:13:34.830 --> 01:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
conflict with the actual academic
 
01:13:36.990 --> 01:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
standards that the state board has
 
01:13:40.430 --> 01:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
adopted and so we had asked and I know
 
01:13:42.629 --> 01:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
that Educators have been working on
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
going through that back part of the
 
01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
document and uh you know kind of the
 
01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
agreement that we reached with that
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
group was that they were going to go
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
through that document and they were
 
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
going to identify rules in these areas
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
so rule language that can be
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
incorporated into another or new section
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
of the Ed 306 front half of the draft
 
01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
specifically where that language should
 
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
be incorporated and provided right so
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's stuff in that back area in those
 
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
academic areas that's more General
 
01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
instructional stuff about how you
 
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
operate a school well that should be in
 
01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
the front part right we don't need that
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
in the academic area it should be in how
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
you operate a school the next thing
 
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me was uh proposing rule language
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
that can be carried forward for
 
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
consideration for modifying our State
 
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
academic standards and content
 
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
Frameworks right because there's stuff
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
in those back half documents that
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
probably belongs in the state standards
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day it's those
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
State Standards we want our Educators to
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
be able to go to one place and say like
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
this is if I'm an Arts educator here's
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
my Arts standard this is what I'm
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
supposed to be teaching right not I got
 
01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
to go to my standards and then I got to
 
01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
go check the 306s and see if it calls
 
01:14:45.629 --> 01:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
out something else I'm trying to make a
 
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
simplified uh system that has coherence
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
as it's applied um the next is that
 
01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
there might be rule language proposed
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
for Content areas not addressed by
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
current academic standards right right
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
so I've got areas in the back half of
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
that document in those academic areas
 
01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
that I don't have academic standards for
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
like we've not adopted State academic
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
standards for personal finance now most
 
01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
schools are using the national standards
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
for that but we've not adopted them so
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to need that content in the
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
back half of that document because I
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
don't you can't come in conflict with a
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
standard that hasn't been adopted by the
 
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education or it could
 
01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
just be that it's information that is
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
Superfluous and it's not really needed
 
01:15:25.350 --> 01:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's not adding to uh you know clar for
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
our Educators who are trying to instruct
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
those standards into the schools so that
 
01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:33.639 align:start position:0%
is kind of the work that we're doing
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
there yes go ahead so you are
 
01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
incorporating the feedback that you got
 
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
from that group of Educators that was
 
01:15:43.149 --> 01:15:43.159 align:start position:0%
working together and and gave a lot of
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
feedback to you into the back half of
 
01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
the correct we're trying to we're trying
 
01:15:51.149 --> 01:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
to discern it it was it's not always
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
that clear because we have a lot of
 
01:15:55.629 --> 01:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
various opinions right so what we've
 
01:15:55.639 --> 01:15:56.590 align:start position:0%
various opinions right so what we've
seen

01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:15:59.229 --> 01:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
is um there was a lot of diversity of
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
opinion among people in terms of what we
 
01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
wanted but we're trying to distill it
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll make proposals right so
 
01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
there'll be proposed changes we'll do
 
01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
side by sides on that as well and kind
 
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
of work through
 
01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
yeah the I just would like to close out
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
the back half here but that discussion
 
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
did there when we looked at health
 
01:16:25.229 --> 01:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
education this year and we looked at the
 
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
old curriculum Frameworks which are
 
01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.750 align:start position:0%
old curriculum Frameworks which are
ancient

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
ancient
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
history 2003
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
2003 and and when we looked at this
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
there was significant guidance that came
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
to us from both the old
 
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and and from the
 
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:48.280 align:start position:0%
306s um we were trying to discern where
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
are these academic standards now I've
 
01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
asked that question not just of you but
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
I've asked of Jenny I've asked of L now
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
way going way back and I you know and
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
they say well that the academics the
 
01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
that the curriculum Frameworks are the
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
academic standards that's correct well
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
then we eliminated act the curriculum
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
Frameworks we had legislation this year
 
01:17:08.629 --> 01:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
where we put curriculum Frameworks back
 
01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
into law it's not been signed into law
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
yet but we hopefully will get that back
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
into law so then when we see these
 
01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks which are
 
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines but also host and contain
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
these academic standards are we going to
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
be able to look anywhere and clearly see
 
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
the academic standards for geography or
 
01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:35.239 align:start position:0%
for for health or so those are
 
01:17:36.629 --> 01:17:36.639 align:start position:0%
incorporated into those curriculum
 
01:17:38.189 --> 01:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and again historically going
 
01:17:41.229 --> 01:17:41.239 align:start position:0%
back into the early 2000s that is
 
01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
how the that everybody worked on this
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
system is that they created what you
 
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
could call academic standards but they
 
01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
weren't solely that they Incorporated
 
01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
the curriculum Frameworks into it to try
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
and make the AC my understanding is
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
anyways to try and make those academic
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
standards more useful right um for the
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
Educators so those curriculum Frameworks
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
were adopted by the State Board of
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
Education as the academic standards for
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
those content areas they were voted on
 
01:18:10.350 --> 01:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
you know decades you know in the various
 
01:18:13.149 --> 01:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
decades in past you I I I get that but I
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
also say that you know I as a school
 
01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
administrative principal for years and
 
01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
years and years we looked at you know
 
01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
various sources to tell us what were
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
what are the standards to be taught at
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
this level right and we often times at
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
that time had to go to the old textbooks
 
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
we didn't have it or what were the goals
 
01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
or the objectives yeah and but now where
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
do we go we go to these academic
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
standards and we're seeing a progression
 
01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:42.639 align:start position:0%
of topics that should be taught right
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
are all those topics the academic
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
standards or are there some clear
 
01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
academic standards for civics education
 
01:18:51.790 --> 01:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
yeah no so those are so for example
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
those were adopted in 2005 as the by the
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
State Board of UC ation as the academic
 
01:18:57.870 --> 01:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
standards and so just going one step
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
further what what we're trying to do in
 
01:19:03.550 --> 01:19:03.560 align:start position:0%
this process to your point is not have
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
two places so I got to reference my you
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
know curriculum framework academic
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
standards and I got to reference the
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
306s to figure out what I'm supposed to
 
01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
be doing can we get this stuff
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
Consolidated into a single place um you
 
01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
know is the direction that I mean that's
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
really the framework that you all have
 
01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
set up right and going back to the very
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
beginning of you know that that the uh
 
01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
the state is responsible for yeah say
 
01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
it's a shared responsibility yeah but
 
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
right but the state is responsible
 
01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
public okay um in the system the state
 
01:19:35.390 --> 01:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
establishes minimum standards for public
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
school approval the front half and
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
academic standards for inclusion and
 
01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
delivery of an educational system right
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
and so that's what we're trying to say
 
01:19:43.629 --> 01:19:43.639 align:start position:0%
like that's what we're going to come up
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
with right and so what we don't want to
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
do is we don't want those academic
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
standards to be diffused in two places
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
so that people are like well I looked
 
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
over here but I didn't look over here
 
01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
like let's see if we can't get all this
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
stuff together I think is the right way
 
01:19:57.390 --> 01:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
to do that I I hope you can manage to
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
get this thing done so we can I'm not as
 
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
optimistic I can redo all of those
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
because you open up these academic
 
01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
standards and it just goes uh you know
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult there's a lot of
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
constituent input that needs to take
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
place well as a local school district I
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
have responsibility for curriculum and
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
instruction yep and when I look at my
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum instruction and instruction
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
has to
 
01:20:20.189 --> 01:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
parallel what we're how we're what we're
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
teaching yep and the accountability
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
system uh so that I want to be able to
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
look in one place as the school
 
01:20:31.229 --> 01:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
principal saying here it is uh teachers
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
in the building that the these are the
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
academic standards if you can get them
 
01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
all hooked into those Frameworks that's
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
wonderful rather than us having to go to
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
the 306s and carve through that and
 
01:20:43.709 --> 01:20:43.719 align:start position:0%
trying to figure it out exactly I am
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly in agreement and I think
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
everybody would benefit from a more
 
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
straightforward simplified type of an
 
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
approach yeah thank you yes represent L
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you again
 
01:20:55.950 --> 01:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner um so so I appreciate what
 
01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
you talked about in terms of the um the
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
rules being the proposed rules being in
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
draft form that it's a working document
 
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
right now and that uh and that nothing's
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
really you know you know firmed up in um
 
01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
you know well I do know that the board
 
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
is still working on it yeah that's what
 
01:21:12.070 --> 01:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
I'm saying that's what I'm saying so I
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh I appreciate that very
 
01:21:16.350 --> 01:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
much and and I'm glad to hear it too
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
because we've got a lot of different
 
01:21:20.590 --> 01:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
sort of versions uh floating around this
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
table right here so we're not quite sure
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
where where where things are at today
 
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
and and and so your your updates though
 
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
have been very helpful but Mr chair and
 
01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
and Mr commissioner I would it would it
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
be would now be the the time though
 
01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
where where uh the legislature this
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
committee the legislature the Ed
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
committee could um could could maybe get
 
01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
some firm definition as to the process
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
um step-by-step process moving forward
 
01:21:57.550 --> 01:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
and uh and a um and and a possible
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
timeline for these rules give and I'm
 
01:22:03.149 --> 01:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
just saying a possible one like like you
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
know you know in the process it takes
 
01:22:07.229 --> 01:22:07.239 align:start position:0%
six months to do this or it takes three
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
months to do that uh but uh something
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
that we could look at now while these
 
01:22:15.189 --> 01:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
rules are being worked on so that we
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
understand what all of our different
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
roles are in the um uh in you know in
 
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
the development recommendation and and
 
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
approval of of the rules do we know
 
01:22:30.669 --> 01:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
enough to to to draft a process and
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
workflow document at this so the the
 
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
process that you should follow is the
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
jail car process right that includes
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
statutory timelines and statutory uh you
 
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
know deadlines for moving forward so we
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
are going to follow that process and
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
depending upon you know how much input
 
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
we get or don't input we get I don't you
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
know the State Board is going to take up
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
this the draft and continue working on
 
01:22:55.790 --> 01:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
it like until they agree on a final
 
01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
draft I can't go to the next step
 
01:22:59.990 --> 01:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
anyways and so they're working on it but
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
I think your best framework is the jail
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
car process which is statutory so so
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
thanks but but as we've talked about for
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
the academic related standards the quote
 
01:23:12.990 --> 01:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
back half of this document it also
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
involves this um um this committee is
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
isn't that my isn't that the understand
 
01:23:20.669 --> 01:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
what we got to do is we have to the last
 
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
time this was done in
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
2015 and and that was
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
the the requirement we have put in law
 
01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
every 10 years and so we can back off
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
and we can Calculate working with
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
attorney moral here and others
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
determine where what's the final date
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to get this thing
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
done by and and working with the board
 
01:23:44.669 --> 01:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
and finding out where the board is I
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
think that there's a some latitude for
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
this and so we can get some dates and we
 
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:51.719 align:start position:0%
can start planning ourselves as far as
 
01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
the communication first I'd like to see
 
01:23:55.229 --> 01:23:55.239 align:start position:0%
the side by side that you it's a working
 
01:23:56.910 --> 01:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
document now that's not the final
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
product we get that but we need to be
 
01:24:02.350 --> 01:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
able to offer some suggestions at and
 
01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
I'd like to put a list of those things
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
together and get that off to you guys as
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
soon as possible at the end of this
 
01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
month y so we will meet again for the
 
01:24:12.270 --> 01:24:12.280 align:start position:0%
end of this month and then we will also
 
01:24:14.669 --> 01:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
work with the attorneys and and and the
 
01:24:16.590 --> 01:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
board finding out is there a projected
 
01:24:18.510 --> 01:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
date in which your your board is going
 
01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:21.400 align:start position:0%
to take that I the the board is governed
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
by the jail car process right so I'm
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
trying to encourage them
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
in a in AED that comp with their statut
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
rle Mak requirements right if they
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
default on that process I'm not sure
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
what if we have to go back to the
 
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
beginning I'm not sure how that works
 
01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.270 align:start position:0%
beginning I'm not sure how that works
right

01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah i' I've not ever defaulted on
 
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking process
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
so the attorney can give us some help
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
alone that we don't need exactly but he
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
can lay out the the jard process that we
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
are bound by right that's what we have
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
to follow so well
 
01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:57.400 align:start position:0%
commun clearly for us right okay I think
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done thank you very are
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
there any other questions of the
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner right now Ju Just a just a
 
01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
a thought Mr chair um that while while
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
we while we have I think a little I
 
01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
think we' sort of budgeted you know you
 
01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
know couple hours for for this meeting
 
01:25:17.629 --> 01:25:17.639 align:start position:0%
so uh we we possibly have a little bit
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
of time for this but we do have some
 
01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
members for the public here transparency
 
01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
has been an important you know part of
 
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
this process and I'm wondering if maybe
 
01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
we could um we could open up to uh to
 
01:25:31.310 --> 01:25:31.320 align:start position:0%
some public comment no I I'm not going
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
to go there with that because I put it
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
out clearly beforehand and in the letter
 
01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
that I communicated with the
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner that we are not going to
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
take other input in fact the hearing
 
01:25:45.109 --> 01:25:45.119 align:start position:0%
process has been established where the
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
public can communicate on
 
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
these you know Draft rules directly to
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education and when's
 
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
that process
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
conclude so we had an as I pointed out
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
an extended public comment period that
 
01:26:04.990 --> 01:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
lasted from February 15 till April 30th
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
um is how long that the public comment
 
01:26:09.629 --> 01:26:09.639 align:start position:0%
period is we still continue to receive
 
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
uh feedback from constituents in the
 
01:26:13.709 --> 01:26:13.719 align:start position:0%
field and we're happy to take that they
 
01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
cannot be part of the formal public
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
comment at this point in time but
 
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
certainly I rick gave me a number of
 
01:26:22.229 --> 01:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
good suggestions today that we will take
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
back and uh and process those so were
 
01:26:27.109 --> 01:26:27.119 align:start position:0%
interested in getting a good proposal um
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
but we did have an extended public
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
comment period and provided ample
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity for everybody to
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
testify yeah I you know if if we have
 
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
desire to get you know individual
 
01:26:39.550 --> 01:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
members on this committee can go get
 
01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:41.639 align:start position:0%
that in information then we can have a
 
01:26:43.709 --> 01:26:43.719 align:start position:0%
meeting we could get input if we want
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
that on the back half regarding the
 
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
academic standards however I think for
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
us to conduct a hearing on the minimum
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
were stepping out of our domain uh our
 
01:26:59.709 --> 01:26:59.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility is not that it is that of
 
01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
the academic standards which are
 
01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:03.400 align:start position:0%
integrated into the back part but
 
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
there's front part too like competencies
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
impacts the back and the definitions
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
impact the back and so um but I I feel
 
01:27:15.149 --> 01:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
this time that we are able to you
 
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
know in the letter I wrote the the June
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
11 meeting is open to the public however
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
the primary purpose of meeting is to
 
01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
allow for a dialogue between the
 
01:27:24.870 --> 01:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
committee members and the department
 
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
as as public testimony and written
 
01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
comments regarding draft changes to the
 
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
306 rules has been received by the state
 
01:27:35.229 --> 01:27:35.239 align:start position:0%
board and I do not want to get into the
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
role of being the state board and I've
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
tried to summarize for you kind of where
 
01:27:40.270 --> 01:27:40.280 align:start position:0%
we are in the process all of the
 
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
information all of the public feedback
 
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
is on our website everybody can go look
 
01:27:44.669 --> 01:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
at every single thing all the
 
01:27:46.830 --> 01:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
correspondents the entire process for
 
01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
how we've gone through this all the
 
01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:50.360 align:start position:0%
various iterations are out there as well
 
01:27:51.629 --> 01:27:51.639 align:start position:0%
um so if people have questions I would
 
01:27:54.189 --> 01:27:54.199 align:start position:0%
encourage them to take a look at that
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
are there any further
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
comments so with that I'm going to close
 
01:28:00.510 --> 01:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
the meeting and thank you very much
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank you I wish you uh
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
good pathway ahead here with this uh
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's very very important and it
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
impacts every student in this state and
 
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
future students and um we we have to
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
make some changes here if we don't do
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
something it's just like I said the
 
01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
other day with higher education we gotta
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
watch what's going to be 10 years from
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
now and it's not going to be good
 
01:28:29.189 --> 01:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.830 --> 01:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
you okay um we we are still here um we
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
had um is there any discussion amongst
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves on this I you know I heard
 
01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
that we're probably going to have to
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
have another meeting here this month oh
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sure thank you um yeah I I I I think
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
you're probably right Mr chair
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
um and and something I I I want to think
 
01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about too and I wonder
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
you do Mr chair is a comment you just
 
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
you just made which I think was very
 
01:29:06.510 --> 01:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
good that that um um that there are
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
parts of the front half document related
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
to the minimum standard such as
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
competencies that that also have bearing
 
01:29:17.709 --> 01:29:17.719 align:start position:0%
on the on the academic standards and
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
should things like competencies um or
 
01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
changes to
 
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
competencies things like that that
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
relate to the academic standards also be
 
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
in the um in the subject to the the
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
oversight um committee I I think that's
 
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
it it's relates to Improvement and
 
01:29:36.590 --> 01:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
assessment and that's what this
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
committee's task to do um I think there
 
01:29:42.629 --> 01:29:42.639 align:start position:0%
is a relationship between some items now
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
maybe a school facility I've always
 
01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
advocated though that's the fourth leg
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
of the stool if you don't have a good
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
building not going to have you know
 
01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
things a chemistry lab but I I think
 
01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
that we should be looking at those
 
01:29:57.629 --> 01:29:57.639 align:start position:0%
definitions which impact what we're
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
doing in the second half like Career
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
Technical education or or or or or
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
competencies or or proficiency vers
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
achievement and learning verse grade I
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
think that interacts with the back half
 
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
there's some areas though that don't and
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
it's not our domain so I think we'll try
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
to filter through that and and identify
 
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
the areas I'm not saying no to it no no
 
01:30:20.550 --> 01:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know thank you thank you very much
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and and perhaps as the as the
 
01:30:26.109 --> 01:30:26.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner updating the um the side by
 
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
side that um that that maybe for a first
 
01:30:33.109 --> 01:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
pass you know those those rules that
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
that do have bearing on academic
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
standards not just rule 31 on but those
 
01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
could be indicated in a side by side so
 
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
that we we we all know what we're
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
referencing so so I'll make the easy
 
01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
reference which I and I apologize for
 
01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
jumping back in but I sound like you had
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
a question so it's that list right that
 
01:30:52.109 --> 01:30:52.119 align:start position:0%
says like for example where it says and
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
again this is some of the feedback from
 
01:30:54.910 --> 01:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
jail car which says family consumer
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
science right are we am I able to make
 
01:30:59.350 --> 01:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
rules on that or not that's a question
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
that I have um you know and so if this
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
you know body can kind of weigh in on
 
01:31:05.669 --> 01:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
that and say do you want us to do rules
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
on that um or not we're happy to or
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
we're happy to not but we want to try
 
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we're having Fidelity
 
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
to that statute uh uh attorney Merl
 
01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:20.840 align:start position:0%

leave a submit a list from jel car or
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
things for the doe to look at that we
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
could possibly get a hold of yeah we
 
01:31:32.350 --> 01:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
have our comments well we have our whole
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
